"Video Review: After 15-Year Break, Lincoln Continental Returns With Style","The Continental name carries gravitas. So much, in fact, that it’s easy to forget that Lincoln hasn’t used the nameplate since 2002. It’s like realizing that Team Flakes hasn’t been available in the grocery store for years.Unlike the breakfast cereal, Continental is back. After a 15-year sabbatical, this luxury sedan arrives looking toned, confident and, well, familiar. When the concept debuted in 2015, Luc Donckerwolke, Bentley’s design director at the time, famously asked the Lincoln team on Facebook, “Do you want us to send the product tooling?” The production car retains a Bentley Flying Spur silhouette, and the Revel speaker grilles carry an uncanny resemblance to their Burmester counterparts in a Mercedes.As others before me have said, “Good artists copy; great artists steal.”There is original character, especially the exterior door pulls integrated into the chrome window beltline. Touch the electronic pad inside them and the doors open with a slight spring-loaded pop. Top-tier models get a power mechanism that gently cinches the doors closed the last inch or so. They’re not the rear-hinged doors of the 1960s Continentals, but they attract attention.Lincoln wisely decided not to out-German the Germans. Instead, it focused on updating the Continental’s American pampering abilities.Before diving further into this 10th generation (the “Mark” designation is no longer used), a quick Continental primer. The original 1939 model was commissioned by Edsel Ford to be his personal vehicle. Frank Lloyd Wright was so smitten, he bought two. In 1956, the Mark II Continental cost an eye-popping $10,000, and it was a star driven by the stars. Warner Bros. thanked Elizabeth Taylor for making the film “Giant” by giving her one in a custom color that matched her dazzling eyes.The ninth-generation Continental had become a warmed-over Ford. The new one’s sole visual cue to its Ford origins is the Sync 3 user interface. The chassis structure may be adapted from the Fusion/MKZ platform, but that’s out of sight. The Lincoln deservedly gets its own knobs with a ribbed look and feel.There are three V6 engine choices. I drove the most powerful, a twin-turbocharged 3-liter with 400 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque. Choosing it demands all-wheel drive that sends varying power to each wheel. Buyer’s note: It’s more sophisticated than the all-wheel-drive mechanics paired to the turbocharged 2.7-liter engine. Base-model Continentals are front-wheel drive.The six-speed transmission operates with push buttons near the dashboard LCD screen. This layout is simplicity defined, but I hesitated every time I engaged it. Could it be too straightforward? Drive modes adjust the steering weight, suspension firmness, and throttle and transmission response. Altering the modes, though, means diving a couple of pages into the menu.The 3-liter moves out smartly with 0- to 60-mile-an-hour excursions taking a brief five seconds. The muted growl is pleasant. The cabin, aided by noise cancellation technology, is hushed in the expected way.Motoring to the grocery store in comfort mode, the Continental mostly shrugs off big bumps and potholes while quelling float and wallow. No need to shop for Dramamine. In its most athletic mode, the big Lincoln hustles through turns in dignified form. It lacks the athletic dynamisms of a Cadillac CT6, but the Lincoln insulates passengers from rough roads more effectively. Given the current state of highways, the Lincoln arguably provides a better real-world dynamic.Continental doesn’t provide the creaminess of a BMW 5 Series or Mercedes E-Class, but it’s more affordable. The base Continentals begin at $45,645. The fully optioned Black Label edition can rise past $81,000. My tester, a well-equipped Reserve model, retails for about $72,600. It comes with a $4,215 technology package that includes automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, head-up display and semiautonomous parking.The Environmental Protection Agency rates the turbo 3-liter’s fuel economy at 16 miles per gallon in the city, 24 highway and a 19 m.p.g. average. That brings up the rear in this class. At least it runs on standard-grade gas.The cabin has the right ambience for a Continental, though it is on the shiny side. Keep a set of sunglasses aboard; there’s enough brightwork and glossy wood to trim a yacht. Run a hand across the dashboard, though, and it feels rubbery; touch the door pulls and the sensation is distinctly vinyl. Perhaps upgrading to the Black Label level puts buttery leather in those places. For $1,500, you get 30-way adjustable seats. Who knew there were 30 ways to tweak a chair?Of course, the back seat is spacious — it’s a Lincoln Continental. Equipped as mine was with an $850 climate package, it offers passengers their own temperature zone, toasty seat cushions and a power rear sunshade. Those who are driven should spring for the $4,300 back seat package that adds all sorts of amenities and a richer Bentley-esque atmosphere. (The rear armrest on my car had plastics more suited to a Focus.)The well-trimmed but modest trunk has the same useful size as a Honda Civic’s. Fortunately, the seats split and fold.Team Flakes may be gone for good, but the Lincoln team did a commendable job of returning the Continental to market. It has been updated to meet modern luxury demands. Shunning retro design and a harsh sporty ride, the Continental feels comfortable in its own skin, even if it’s not a completely original one."
"Fyre Was Bad. For the Concert Industry, This One Could Be Worse.","For the concert industry, the disastrous failure of the Fyre Festival in the Bahamas was an outlier — a sad spectacle, but an isolated one.But the collapse of another event, the Pemberton Music Festival in the mountains of Canada, has put the business on edge, with veteran talent agents and promoters warning that it could have wide implications for the booming festival market.Pemberton, planned for July 13 to 16 with acts including Chance the Rapper, Muse and A Tribe Called Quest, was abruptly canceled on May 18, when the two companies behind it declared bankruptcy. In a break from standard practice, ticket holders were not offered refunds, but were instead told that they could “file a proof of claim form as an unsecured creditor.”Music executives are now aghast over the failure to provide refunds and the maneuvering of investors in the weeks before the festival fell apart. Marc Geiger, the head of music at William Morris Endeavor and an outspoken voice in the business, called Pemberton’s collapse “a fraud and a scam” that could have a domino effect on the industry, hurting smaller promoters the most.“This could be the symbolic end for independently promoted festivals,” he said.Pemberton, held in a picturesque spot about 100 miles north of Vancouver, British Columbia, was a typical entry into the frothy festival business. It was revived in 2014 by Huka Entertainment, a well-known independent promoter, after an earlier iteration failed. According to bankruptcy filings, the festival lost money for three years, and sold 18,000 tickets in 2017, down from 38,000 last year.After the cancellation, fans took to social media to vent and mock using the hashtag #PembyFest. The complaints were not quite the supernova that followed the dissolution of the Fyre Festival, when planeloads of millennials arrived to find a ramshackle site that was far from the luxurious beach paradise they had been sold.But the collapse of both Fyre and Pemberton has once again focused the industry’s attention on what has become a perennial question: Has the ever-expanding festival market hit its peak? High-profile failures like Pemberton and Fyre — which is now facing numerous lawsuits from ticket buyers and others — could erode consumer confidence, Mr. Geiger said.Then there is simply natural competition, as more festivals are added to the calendar.“Well-produced and curated events at a site the public loves will continue to do well,” said Gary Bongiovanni, the editor of the trade publication Pollstar. “But too many events mean the best will survive and the weak will wither.”World-famous events like Coachella began as risky endeavors undertaken by small promoters. If the credit markets for festivals grow too tight, there may be no room for such innovation, said Sam Hunt, an agent with Paradigm Talent Agency whose artists Major Lazer and Run the Jewels had both been booked for Pemberton.“This industry thrives on a variety of creative individuals doing things in new and creative ways,” Mr. Hunt said. “If they become more constrained, everybody loses.”Mr. Geiger reserves a special ire for Pemberton’s investors, among them several wealthy Canadians with no background in the music business. As secured creditors, they now stand a better chance of getting their money back than the fans who paid $275 a ticket. One investor, Amanda Girling, is also chief executive of a company that owns the land on which the festival was held, and which is for sale for $12.5 million.In filings, the two entities that controlled the festival — Pemberton Music Festival Limited Partnership and 1115666 B.C. Ltd. — declared $5 million in assets and $12.5 million in liabilities, with ticket holders listed as having an unsecured claim of $6 million. The first meeting of creditors is scheduled for June 6 in Vancouver.Further muddying the Pemberton situation are questions of control, with Mr. Geiger and others accusing the organizers of swapping shell companies for the investors’ benefit. In April, the investors created 1115666 B.C. and made it general partner of Pemberton Music Festival Limited Partnership, which controlled the festival.William E. J. Skelly, a lawyer for the investors, said in an email that the new company was created to give the directors “greater management control and transparency” over the event’s finances.Less than a month later, the investors resigned as directors of the newly formed company and, the very next day, declared both companies bankrupt.“The fact that somebody decided to stick it to the consumer, not deliver any product, and say they are protected by bankruptcy, is hideous,” Mr. Geiger said.Funds from ticket sales are often held by ticketing companies in case an event is canceled, but smaller promoters may depend on advances to pay expenses. Pemberton’s ticketing company, Ticketfly, paid the festival operators each week, Mr. Skelly said. Ticketfly declined to comment.Mr. Geiger likened this process to the easy availability of credit before the housing crisis, and said the fallout from Pemberton meant that the financing arrangements behind festivals will most likely be tightened. Ticketing companies will be reluctant to pay advances, and artists will demand more money upfront, he said. If that happens, the only companies that could meet the multimillion-dollar capital requirements to stage a large event would be corporate players like Live Nation and AEG.“It may be an advantage for the bigger guys,” said Peter Shapiro, an independent promoter behind Brooklyn Bowl and the Lockn’ festival in Virginia. “But for the new guys starting out, it’s going to be a much more difficult environment.”Some longtime players in the concert industry see these developments as a consequence of the growing corporatization of the business. That process began in the 1990s and has gone through another wave lately, with small promoters bought out by Live Nation and AEG. In this landscape, independents are finding it harder and harder to compete.“What we’re witnessing now is a result of what’s been going on now for more than 10 years with the consolidation of the music industry,” said John Scher, a veteran promoter in New York and New Jersey."
"Trump Awarded a New Chinese Trademark, This Time for Catering","President Trump and his daughter Ivanka could sell jewelry and wedding dresses and provide catering services in China under new trademarks granted in recent days by Beijing.The new trademarks expand the president’s business interests in the world’s second-largest economy after the United States’, which have already stirred complaints over a possible conflict of interest.During his campaign, Mr. Trump regularly blamed China for the loss of American industrial jobs and pledged to take a tough trade stance with Beijing. That position has since softened, in particular after an April meeting with President Xi Jinping of China.As a businessman, Mr. Trump has made money by licensing the use of his name on an array of products around the world, like vodka in Israel or soap in India.He has  added to that list since taking office. Over the last three weeks, China’s trademark office gave preliminary approval for one trademark to Mr. Trump for providing catering services and four to his daughter through her trademarking business, Ivanka Trump Marks. Ms. Trump’s trademarks include those for jewelry, wedding dresses, watches and a range of electronic devices.Mr. Trump applied for the trademark in April 2016, while his daughter applied for the four trademarks from May to July last year.Mr. Trump has at least 89 trademarks registered and 28 others that have won preliminary approval. His daughter now has 17 registered trademarks and six that have won preliminary approval. Trademarks with preliminary approval are formally registered three months later if officials receive no objections.Abigail Klem, the president of Ivanka Trump’s company, said that those trademarks were made “in the normal course of business” and noted that the company had taken similar steps in the past, “especially in regions where trademark infringement is rampant.”She said the firm had seen a “surge” in companies trying to capitalize on the Trump name. “It is our responsibility to diligently protect our trademark,” she said.The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The latest trademarks give the Trump Organization further control over its brand in a country where opportunists frequently register well-known trademarks in a practice called “trademark squatting.”Since his political rise, leather goods, toilets and cosmetics bearing the Trump name but trademarked by others have been spotted being sold around China. To avoid such problems, lawyers often advise that brands register their trademarks across broad categories of goods.The Trump Organization has said it will not make any more international deals. It is currently being run by Mr. Trump’s two adult sons.China has said it has acted in accordance to law regarding Trump’s trademarks. Still, the family’s business dealings with China have been criticized.Last weekend, two activists investigating labor practices at Chinese factories that make shoes for Ivanka Trump, among other brands, went missing, according to their employer, China Labor Watch, and a third was detained.Mr. Trump’s business interests in China have also concerned some senators, who have pointed out that Beijing could use the trademarks to try to sway United States policy.In February, Mr. Trump won a 10-year legal battle over the right to protect his name brand for construction projects. The ultimate trademark approval was disclosed days after talks with Mr. Xi and after Mr. Trump dropped his challenge of China’s Taiwan policy."
Exxon Vote on Climate Change Puts Other Companies on Notice,"Shareholders of the oil giant Exxon Mobil have finally won a long-sought climate change victory. Over 60 percent of them backed a move that forces the $340 billion company to ramp up global-warming disclosure, up from under 40 percent in a similar attempt last year. Exxon already embraces the debate more than most. But shareholders want the company to be more forthcoming. Holdouts among their industry peers will have to follow or risk investor ire.Exxon's chief executive, Darren Woods, who took the helm at the beginning of the year, wrote in his first blog post about the importance of managing the risks of climate change. On several occasions Mr. Woods has talked about how Exxon does business in an environment in which, under the 2015 Paris accord, nearly 200 countries, including China and India, have agreed to reduce their carbon emissions.At the company’s annual meeting in Dallas on Wednesday, Mr. Woods reiterated Exxon’s commitment to adhere to the guidelines of the agreement even if President Trump decides to withdraw the United States from the deal. Yet Exxon’s energy outlook remains fairly rosy, showing rising oil demand through 2040. Oil and gas development, Mr. Woods said, will still need $11 trillion of investment even under the constraints of the Paris agreement.Some shareholders have for several years found this discussion unsatisfactory. They have asked Exxon to analyze in more depth the potential effect on the company’s business of limits on greenhouse gas emissions, and to try to assess what might happen beyond 2040. And they have demanded access to independent directors to discuss their concerns. The difference this year is that more of them, potentially including big institutions like BlackRock, now want more information. After Wednesday’s vote, the company has to oblige.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr. Woods was vague on Exxon’s plans to comply. It’s not the first time an American company has gotten such a directive from shareholders — it happened at Occidental Petroleum earlier this month, for example — and greater disclosure is more common at European energy groups. Still, Exxon is the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company and it sets the standard. Others in the sector should consider themselves on notice."
Harvard Law School Names John Manning Its Next Dean,"Harvard Law School has a new dean.John Manning, a deputy dean and constitutional law professor, will take over as the school’s next dean on July 1, the law school announced on Thursday.His appointment, to succeed Martha L. Minow, who will step down on June 30, drew praise from Elena Kagan, an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, who served as the law school’s dean from 2003 to 2009.“Having admired John Manning since we were law students together more than 30 years ago, I know he will lead Harvard Law School with the energy, intelligence, collegiality, and good judgment that he brings to everything he does,” Justice Kagan said in a statement. “He embodies a blend of scholarly accomplishment, devotion to teaching, engagement with practice, and passion for the law that represents the best of our profession.”A graduate of both Harvard and Harvard Law School, Mr. Manning takes over the helm at a time when the law school has been carving out a bigger role in making legal education more accessible.In March, the school announced that it would accept results of the Graduate Record Exam, or G.R.E., for the admission of students starting in fall 2018. Law schools traditionally have relied on the Law School Admissions Test, or L.S.A.T., scores for admissions. Harvard Law was only the country’s second law school to say it would accept the G.R.E.When the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law announced its plan last year to accept G.R.E. scores, as well as L.S.A.T. scores, it caused a bit of an uproar in the legal profession.Responding to complaints that the L.S.A.T. was less available than the G.R.E., the Law School Admission Council, which administers the L.S.A.T., announced on Thursday that the test would be given more frequently. It will now be available to students six times a year instead of the longstanding practice of four times.In another step to broaden the field of applicants, Harvard Law last month expanded a pilot program for Harvard juniors to defer admission to the law school as long as they finish college and spend at least two years working, studying or pursuing research or fellowships. As of this fall, juniors from any college who are accepted to the law school can take advantage of the program.As a deputy dean for the last four years, Mr. Manning has been part of those decisions, particularly the move to accept G.R.E. results for admissions.In an interview on Thursday, he said that he planned to consult with faculty, students and alumni to look at the law school curriculum, ways to ensure students have the skills to be excellent lawyers and how to diversify the field of applicants.“We want to make sure we are drawing on students from a diverse applicant pool,” he said. “We want to have a diverse community, which makes for a more lively community.”Mr. Manning joined the law school faculty in 2004 after a decade at Columbia Law School. Previously, he had two stints at the Justice Department, in the Office of Legal Counsel and the solicitor general’s office. Earlier, he was a law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year, and Judge Robert H. Bork of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, who died in 2012.At Harvard Law, Mr. Manning has taught courses on administrative law, federal courts, legislation and regulation, separation of powers and statutory interpretation. He has argued nine cases before the Supreme Court, and is known for his expertise in statutory interpretation and structural constitutional law."
"Stanley F. Whitman, Who Saw Luxury as a Shopping Center Lure, Dies at 98","Stanley F. Whitman, a real estate developer who was hailed as a visionary in the mid-1960s when he had the idea of building an open-air shopping center near Miami Beach for luxury retailers, naming it Bal Harbour Shops, died on May 24 at his home in Miami Shores, Fla. He was 98.His family announced his death. A week before he died, officials in the village of Bal Harbour approved a 350,000-square-foot expansion of Bal Harbour Shops, almost doubling its size. He had helped incorporate the village, at the north end of the Miami Beach barrier island, in 1946.Mr. Whitman was one of the first developers to see the potential of bringing upscale retailers like Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue to a shopping center in an outdoor tropical setting. He opened Bal Harbour Shops after visiting retail stores around the world on a kind of fact-finding mission.Landscaped with palm and orange trees, the shopping center is today a stage for more than 100 high-end fashion brands, including Chloé, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Prada and Louis Vuitton. With 450,000 square feet of retail space, it is also one of the biggest revenue creators among American malls, generating $2,555 a square foot in sales a year, according to Mr. Whitman’s company, Whitman Family Development.“He touched so many people’s lives and changed the shopping center industry,” said Cheryl Stephenson, a friend who worked for Mr. Whitman. In the succeeding years, many luxury retail centers have been built, among them the Beverly Center in Los Angeles and The Shops at Crystals in Las Vegas.Stanley Finch Whitman was born on Nov. 15, 1918, in Evanston, Ill., to William and Leona E. Whitman. His father owned a printing company in Chicago and also developed real estate properties in the Miami area.The tropical beach setting of Bal Harbour Shops harked back to Mr. Whitman’s upbringing. He grew up in Miami Beach with his brothers, Bill and Dudley, in a single-family home on the ocean at 32nd Street and Collins Avenue.Mr. Whitman attended Duke University, where he met his future wife, Dottie Stivers. After graduating during World War II, he joined the Navy’s officer training school and went on to oversee a fleet of submarine chasers. He was honorably discharged as a lieutenant commander in 1945.By the time he returned from the war, his father had died. Mr. Whitman assumed responsibility for one of the family’s Miami Beach properties on Lincoln Road, which was one of the hottest shopping districts during the 1920s but was beginning to decline.His grandson, Matthew W. Lazenby, who now leads the company, said Mr. Whitman had worked diligently to keep the Lincoln Road building immaculate. But he grew frustrated with other real estate owners who put little effort into maintaining their properties, contributing to Lincoln Road’s even greater loss of allure in the 1950s and ’60s, Mr. Lazenby said.It was the long-lost glamour of Lincoln Road that inspired Mr. Whitman’s vision for Bal Harbour Shops, Mr. Lazenby said.Mr. Whitman was one of the 25 people who incorporated what would become the village of Bal Harbour in 1946. He teamed up with Robert Graham, a developer there, to build a business district and later bought out Mr. Graham in pursuing his vision for Bal Harbour Shops.Besides Mr. Lazenby, Mr. Whitman is survived by a son, Randall, who has also been involved in the business; a daughter, Gwen W. Lazenby; three other grandchildren; and four great-grandsons. His wife died in 2008.Mr. Whitman’s family described him as an avid weight lifter and tennis player. After his wife, a bicycling enthusiast, suffered a stroke about a year before her death, Mr. Lazenby said, Mr. Whitman spent weeks researching special bicycles for the handicapped until finding one, a two-seater, that allowed her to sit in the rear while he pedaled from the front."
‘Climate Change Is Real’: Many U.S. Companies Lament Paris Accord Exit,"Soon after President Trump announced that the United States would back out of the Paris climate accord, several large companies based in the United States that had supported the international pact said they were disappointed by the decision and would continue their environmental efforts.And two chief executives who sat on Mr. Trump’s economic advisory council — Elon Musk and Robert A. Iger — said they were leaving that group because they disagreed with the exit from the Paris agreement.While Mr. Trump said the decision to exit the deal was made to protect American jobs — a contention that environmental groups have disputed — some large companies had urged the president to stay in the accord.Twenty-five companies, including Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, bought full-page ads in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post last month to argue their case. Some of those companies, and others with similar views in the technology, energy and engineering sectors, reacted quickly on Thursday.But so did some companies, particularly in the coal industry, that supported Mr. Trump’s decision.Tesla and SpaceXElon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, said he would leave an advisory council for Mr. Trump.DisneyRobert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, also said he would no longer be an advisory council member.General ElectricJeff Immelt, G.E.’s chairman and chief executive, said in a Twitter message:FacebookMark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, wrote on his Facebook page:Twitter and SquareJack Dorsey, the chief executive of both companies, wrote on Twitter:GoogleSundar Pichai, the chief executive, said on Twitter:Goldman SachsLloyd Blankfein, the chief executive, had never used Twitter before but addressed the exit from the accord in his first tweet:MicrosoftBrad Smith, Microsoft’s president, said in a statement that the company was disappointed in the decision.AppleFrom a letter to employees by Tim Cook, the chief executive, obtained by The New York Times:AmazonThe company released a statement in a series of tweets:Murray EnergyThe Ohio-based company, one of the largest coal-producing companies in the country and a prominent supporter of Mr. Trump, praised the decision.

Attendance Drops at Disney Parks Worldwide as Prices Rise,"LOS ANGELES — In a rare slowdown in one of the hottest areas of the entertainment business, attendance declined at 13 of 14 Disney theme parks around the world in 2016 compared with 2015, according to an independent report released on Thursday. Higher prices, intended in part to ease crowding at certain parks, were a major contributor, analysts said.Attendance, of course, does not equal profit. The Walt Disney Company’s theme park unit had operating income of $3.3 billion in fiscal 2016, a 9 percent increase from the year before, in part because of a new ticketing strategy that raised prices for peak periods by 20 percent.But a simultaneous attendance decline at 13 Disney parks — all except Shanghai Disneyland, which has not been open a year — is notable because it rarely happens. More typical has been scorching annual growth, so much so that Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., reaches capacity on certain days.Over the last decade, attendance has declined only once before at Disney’s flagship park, the Magic Kingdom. At no time in the last decade has attendance fallen across Disney’s global portfolio.The report compiled by the Themed Entertainment Association and Aecom, an engineering company. Disney does not disclose attendance data for most of its properties, including the Magic Kingdom and five other parks near Orlando, Fla., that make up Walt Disney World.Disney responded to a request for comment with a statement that emphasized ongoing construction projects at multiple parks: “We are investing behind the wealth of great franchises we have in order to deliver magical experiences that exceed our guests’ expectations.”The biggest declines occurred overseas. At Disneyland Paris, attendance plunged 14 percent, to 9.8 million, as tourism across Europe continued to be affected by terrorism fears. Bad weather was also a factor. Hong Kong Disneyland had a 10 percent drop, to 6.1 million, amid a continued decline in tourism from mainland China. Disney recently unveiled $1.4 billion in upgrades in Hong Kong.But Disney’s North American parks had more modest declines. Attendance at the Magic Kingdom totaled roughly 20.4 million, down 0.5 percent; Disneyland’s estimated total was 17.9 million, down 2 percent. Including Shanghai Disneyland, Disney’s theme park portfolio attracted roughly 139 million visitors in 2016 — dwarfing its competitor Universal, which had attendance of about 47.4 million at five parks worldwide.Even so, Universal had a very good year, the result of popular new Harry Potter attractions. Attendance at Universal Studios Hollywood, for instance, rose nearly 14 percent, to 8.1 million.“It’s really capital expenditures that move the needle,” said John W. Robinett, senior vice president for economics at Aecom. “It’s also important to remember that 2015 was a tremendous year,” he said.Disney’s domestic parks are expected to return to growth in 2017. An “Avatar”-themed expansion opened at Disney’s Animal Kingdom near Orlando last month and has drawn enormous crowds, with visitors waiting as long as four hours to board rides."
High Times Is Sold to Group That Includes Son of Bob Marley,"High Times, the magazine that has chronicled the transformation of marijuana use from an underground vice to a major American business, said on Thursday that it had been acquired by a group of investors that includes Damian Marley, son of the reggae star Bob Marley.The group, led by Adam Levin, the founder of the investment firm Oreva Capital, bought a controlling interest at a price that values the magazine at $70 million, according to The San Francisco Chronicle.In a news release, the new ownership group said it planned to expand the publication’s audience and its events business.“I think most would agree it was not executing business at max potential under the legacy framework established by the founders,” Mr. Levin, who will become chief executive of High Times Holding Co., said in a statement. “We are going to build on the strong base they created to bring High Times from the authority in the counterculture movement to a modern media enterprise.”The magazine, which in January moved its headquarters to Los Angeles, had previously been owned by the New York-based Trans High Corp.Mr. Marley, a reggae artist like his father, noted that he had started reading High Times in high school. “It is now an honor to be a part of the High Times legacy that I’ve been a fan of for so many years,” he said in a statement.The magazine was founded in 1974 by Tom Forcade as a subversive record of the marijuana counterculture. Whereas Playboy centerfolds displayed buxom women, High Times centerfolds displayed beautiful buds. It offered how-to instructions for growing at home, and even advice on best practices for smuggling marijuana.These days, as marijuana acceptance has grown and states continue to legalize its use, High Times balances lifestyle writing with more serious coverage of “ganjapreneurs” and the “cannabusiness.”Cannabusiness is booming. In November, voters in California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada decided through ballot measures to legalize recreational use, joining Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington. More than 20 percent of Americans now live in states where marijuana use is legal.A CBS News poll in April showed that 61 percent of Americans supported legalization. President Trump has said that he is “in favor of medical marijuana 100 percent” and that the issue should be left to the states.In a statement, the company said the new ownership group would “review a backlog of deal opportunities that have accumulated as marijuana has become more mainstream.”The company said it had 236,000 monthly print subscribers and a digital audience of more than 20 million unique visitors a month. But much of its revenue comes from events like the Cannabis Cup, a trade show that began in 1988 and has expanded to multiple locations."
"Blue Apron, a Meal Delivery Service, Files for Public Offering","Blue Apron was a pioneer in delivering food kits to customers for assembling meals at home. Now it is beating a path to an initial public offering.The five-year-old company filed on Thursday to go public, moving to become one of the most prominent consumer start-ups in recent years to pursue a stock listing. It plans to trade under the symbol “APRN.”Blue Apron is seeking to go public as it faces intensifying competition from a host of rivals, including HelloFresh, Sun Basket and the vegetarian-focused Purple Carrot. And its filing shed light on some of the high costs of that race: Even as the company’s revenue grew, its losses and marketing costs soared.A successful public offering would make Blue Apron one of the most recognizable names to enter the public markets since Snap, the parent of Snapchat, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in March.Founded in 2012, Blue Apron was one of the earliest purveyors of so-called meal kits, which provide subscribers with mostly prepared ingredients that they cook at home, following an accompanying recipe. The premise: home cooking, without the trips to the grocery store or the hassle of deciding what to make.The size of Blue Apron’s offering has yet to be determined. The prospectus listed a $100 million fund-raising target, a preliminary number used to determine filing fees.The filing highlighted the enormous growth that Blue Apron has enjoyed since starting. Its sales have risen 10-fold from 2014 to 2016, reaching $795.4 million last year.But its net loss grew 16 percent last year from 2015, to $54.8 million, according to the filing. Using the company’s preferred measure of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, which excludes expenses like stock-based pay and taxes, it lost $43.6 million in 2016, up 32.5 percent from the year before, the filing shows.Some of the increased loss stemmed from the rising cost of ingredients and from spending on marketing, which jumped 10-fold from 2014 to 2016, to $144.1 million.Blue Apron has shown signs of stalled growth in other ways. Its average order value for the first three months of 2017 shrank slightly from the same period a year ago, to $57.23. Both the number of orders per customer and the average revenue per customer also fell slightly in the first quarter of this year compared with the first quarter of 2016.The company has also made moves to grow, including acquiring BN Ranch, one of its beef suppliers.Going public does not mean that Blue Apron’s management is intent on giving up control of the company. The start-up will have three classes of stock: Class A shares that will be sold to the public and will carry one vote per share; Class B shares, which the founders and early investors own, which carry 10 votes per share; and Class C shares, which come with no voting rights and will be used for purposes like acquisitions.As of now, the company’s biggest shareholders are Matthew B. Salzberg and Ilia M. Papas, the founders, who together own just under 40 percent of the class B shares, and the venture capital firms Bessemer Venture Partners and First Round Capital.Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Barclays are leading on the offering."
"Movers: Blackstone Sells Logicor and Nikkei Tops 20,000","We’re following major developments in the markets throughout the day.Blackstone Group said on Friday that it had agreed to sell Logicor, a European logistics and warehouse business, to China Investment Corporation, the Chinese sovereign wealth fund, for 12.25 billion euros, or about $13.8 billion.The deal is one of the largest European real estate transactions.Logicor has more than 147 million square feet of warehouse space in 17 countries, with 70 percent concentrated in Britain, France, Germany and Southern Europe.“We built Logicor through over 50 acquisitions to be a premier pan European logistics real estate company,” Anthony Myers, Blackstone’s head of real estate for Europe, said in a news release.The transaction is expected to close later this year.Shares of Blackstone were up less than one percent in midday trading in New York. — CHAD BRAYThe Japanese benchmark stock index, the Nikkei-225, topped the 20,000 mark on Friday for the first time since December 2015.The surge in stocks has been driven by economic growth and by a weaker yen, which has helped to increase corporate profits.The index finished the day 1.6 percent higher, closing at 20,177.The latest jobs report delivered solid numbers, likely clearing the runway for the Federal Reserve to raise benchmark interest rates when it meets June 13 and 14.• 138,000 jobs were added last month. Economists had expected a gain of about 185,000.• The unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent, the lowest since 2001."
Can You Believe the Jobs Numbers?,"As a candidate, President Trump repeatedly questioned the validity of the Labor Department’s jobs reports. Now it is his administration that is releasing the monthly estimates. No matter who is in the White House, however, civil servants in the Labor Department collect and analyze data the same way.Here are the basic ground rules. The Labor Department releases its employment report on the first Friday of the following month (or occasionally, the second Friday) at 8:30 a.m. The initial monthly estimates are based on separate surveys, and the estimate of jobs added or lost is revised twice in subsequent months.Unemployment can be defined several ways, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes alternative measures. The “official” unemployment rate, and the one most frequently cited, is the percentage of the adult civilian labor force without a job and actively searching for one. Whether someone receives government benefits like unemployment insurance is irrelevant. This measure is known as U-3.The broadest one, which includes both discouraged and underemployed workers, tends to rise and fall with the official rate but is always larger. This measure is known as U-6.The data also provide a window into how specific demographic groups and industries are faring from month to month. (The monthly report does not, however, include a breakdown by state.)Like all statistical measurements, the figures can be both honest and imprecise — a best estimate given the available tools but nonetheless subject to ambiguity, misinterpretation and error. It’s important to keep in mind that every monthly jobs report provides only a temporary and incomplete snapshot of the economy.The monthly employment report is derived from separate surveys that serve different purposes.The first, collected by the Census Bureau since 1942, enables the government to estimate the number of people who are employed and calculate the unemployment rate. It is based on the Current Population Survey, conducted each month among 60,000 households, or about 110,000 individuals from around the country. It is commonly called the household survey.In general, anyone who reports working for pay — even just an hour — during the previous week is considered employed. Anyone who was laid off or actively looked for work (sending out résumés, responding to help-wanted ads) during the previous four weeks, regardless of any government benefits received, is considered unemployed. People who are not looking — this includes millions of students enrolled in college, plenty of parents who are happy to stay home with young children and millions more retirees — are not counted in the labor force.The second,  the Current Employment Statistics program, commonly called the establishment survey, is intended to measure changes over time. This survey, conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, focuses solely on jobs, rather than on individuals. Thus, a single person working two jobs would be counted once by the household survey (one individual is employed) and twice by the payroll survey (two jobs exist).To estimate how many jobs were created and lost, the bureau gathers data each month from 146,000 private business and government agencies covering about 623,000 work sites.As a general rule, the monthly numbers are seasonally adjusted. That means the effects of predictable seasonal events like weather changes, major holidays and school schedules are removed (through a statistical technique) so that cyclical, underlying trends can be better observed.Employed: Someone with a job.Unemployed: Someone without a job, available for work and searching. Labor force: The combination of people working and those who are unemployed, available and looking for a job.Not in the labor force: People who are unemployed and not looking for work.Official unemployment rate: The share of the labor force that is unemployed.Labor force participation rate: The percentage of the population 16 years and older that is either working or actively seeking work.Employment-population ratio: The percentage of the population 16 years and older that is currently working."

"Japan’s Market Surges, but Analysts Worry of Looming Trouble","TOKYO — Japan’s main stock index surged to an 18-month high on Friday, breaking the 20,000 level for the first time since late 2015.Shares have surged on the back of stronger economic growth in Japan and in the United States, as well as improved corporate profits. But analysts have raised concerns that the rally could soon lose steam, arguing that company earnings have been bolstered by tax cuts rather than improved bottom lines.The benchmark Nikkei average gained 1.6 percent on Friday to close at 20,177, the first time it topped the symbolic 20,000 mark since December 2015. Markets in Hong Kong, mainland China, Australia and India also rose.The Nikkei has gained 10 percent since mid-April, as the country’s domestic economy has looked healthier of late. Output expanded for the fifth consecutive quarter at the start of 2017, the longest period of growth for more than a decade.A modest decline in the value of the yen has helped. A weaker currency makes Japanese multinationals like Toyota and Hitachi more profitable, by increasing the value of the revenue they earn outside Japan.Buoyed by robust global demand, earnings at publicly traded Japanese companies during the most recent fiscal year, which ended in March, rose to their highest levels since the 2008 global financial crisis. The gains in the Japanese stock market on Friday were widely shared, with businesses as diverse as steel makers, insurance companies and department stores attracting investors.A strong American economy has also pushed global markets higher, and any sign that the pace of growth in the United States was slowing could undercut those advances.Japanese stocks have in effect been playing catch-up, as well. In spite of the recent surge in share prices, Japan has still underperformed other big markets this year.Some analysts expect the rally to lose steam.One reason is taxes. Profits at Japanese companies have been strengthened in part by falling corporate income tax rates. The government has cut taxes three times since 2013, a change that has been the largest contributor to earnings gains over the past five years, analysts at UBS said in a note to clients this week.Another small tax cut is planned for next year, but the overall momentum for cuts is slowing, UBS noted. That would mean companies will have to find ways to improve their bottom lines on their own, or see the earnings growth that has drawn investors to the Nikkei fade.The gains in Asia on Friday also came before the release of disappointing jobs data in the United States. The American economy created 138,000 jobs in May, the Labor Department said. That was fewer than economists had expected, although the unemployment rate nonetheless fell to 4.3 percent, its lowest level since 2001."
"Germany Investigates Audi Emissions in Europe, Widening VW Inquiry","BERLIN — German prosecutors have widened a criminal investigation into Volkswagen’s Audi unit after authorities accused the luxury carmaker of installing a system designed to evade emissions rules in cars in Europe, a major shift for an inquiry that has previously concentrated on the United States.The move, announced on Friday by authorities in Munich, adds to the troubles facing Volkswagen. The company has been hit by a wave of lawsuits and penalties after revelations in 2015 that it illegally used so-called defeat devices to pollute more than was allowed.The automaker has already agreed to pay $22 billion in penalties and settlements in the United States and pleaded guilty to its vast emissions deception, which involved a variety of Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche-branded vehicles. Six Volkswagen executives face criminal charges in the United States. And the company is grappling with further legal action in Europe, where dozens of senior staff members — including its former chief executive — are being investigated.Munich prosecutors searched Audi offices in March as part of a criminal investigation into Audi’s behavior in the United States, threatening a crucial source of badly needed profit. At the time, prosecutors said the raids were meant to help determine who was responsible for the American wrongdoing.On Friday, Munich officials said they had widened the investigation to include vehicles in Europe. According to Ken Heidenreich, a spokesman for the Munich prosecutors’ office, the decision came after an announcement by Alexander Dobrindt, Germany’s transportation minister, that officials had found software that altered the emissions on Audi’s A7 and A8 sedans from model years 2009-13.Audi said in a statement issued after the announcement that it would begin recalling the vehicles starting in July to correct emissions levels of nitrogen oxide that can “exceed the limit by a factor of up to two.”The Audis affected included software designed to ensure that a urea solution that neutralizes the emissions was administered in high enough doses only in a controlled test-lab environment. But out on the road, the amount of solution administered to the system would be decreased so drivers would not have to fill the tank containing it as frequently.Audi wanted to minimize consumption of the solution, known as AdBlue, because it feared that the inconvenience and expense of refilling the holding tank would turn off buyers.It said that it was cooperating fully with the investigation and Germany’s federal motor transport authority. It apologized to customers for “the inconvenience.”The investigation is particularly troubling for Volkswagen because Audi is a major profit center for the company.Audi’s luxury cars account for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits, so any damage to Audi’s image would be particularly serious. Luxury models like the Audi A8 sedan or the Q7 sport utility vehicle accounted for about 15 percent of the vehicles sold by Volkswagen last year but produced a third of its 14.6 billion euro, or $16.4 billion, operating profit.In addition to admitting that its Volkswagen-brand vehicles illegally evaded American emissions requirements, the company has said that Audi cars sold in the United States had at least three devices that managed the vehicles’ pollution control systems but were not disclosed to regulators as required.On top of what Volkswagen has already agreed to pay in fines and settlements in the United States, Audi will pay $1.2 billion to settle a consumer fraud lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission involving about 80,000 Audi and Porsche vehicles with diesel motors.Volkswagen has insisted that no members of its management board were aware of the emissions fraud, which lasted a decade and, according to the company’s plea agreement in the United States, included engineers, quality-control experts, high-ranking managers and internal lawyers."
"Concord Bicycle Music Adds to Its Catalog, Acquiring Imagem Music Group","With the music industry in the midst of the streaming age, even the indie labels want to bulk up to gain an edge in digital deals and to reach a global audience.Take Concord Bicycle Music, whose roster includes Paul Simon, James Taylor and the Creedence Clearwater Revival catalog. In a slew of deals over the last few years, it has grown from merely a sizable independent with a specialty in grown-up pop to a sort of mini-conglomerate, with holdings in Latin, hard rock and even children’s music.Now Concord Bicycle, which is based in Beverly Hills, Calif., is set to expand even further, with a deal to acquire the Imagem Music Group, one of the world’s largest independent music publishers. Imagem’s catalog of 250,000 compositions includes Rodgers and Hammerstein’s musicals; works by 20th-century classical giants like Stravinsky and Copland; and pop hits by Daft Punk, Pink Floyd and Phil Collins.“As the business continues to change, you have to be able to have a seat at the big table as industrywide deals are negotiated,” said Scott Pascucci, the chief executive of Concord Bicycle. “This deal gives us scale. It gives us more stability, allows us to continue to grow.”Terms of the deal, which was completed Friday, were not disclosed. But three years ago, Imagem, which was founded by the Dutch pension fund ABP and the media company CTM Publishing, tried to sell itself for $650 million, a price that bidders found too high. Concord’s deal is estimated to be for somewhat less than that amount, according to two people briefed on the deal who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.The purchase is Concord Bicycle’s biggest by far, almost doubling the size of the company to nearly $1 billion. Counting Imagem’s business, the combined company would have $290 million in revenue this year, Mr. Pascucci said.The deal will vastly expand the company’s theatrical holdings and add a new piece through Boosey & Hawkes, a premier classical catalog.André de Raaff, Imagem’s chief executive, pointed to a recent Dove commercial using “My Favorite Things” from Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “The Sound of Music” as an example of the catalog’s value.“I dare to say that ‘The Sound of Music’ is making more money now than when it was successful for the first time 50 years ago,” he said.The value of the Boosey & Hawkes catalog is less clear, as classical music remains a small niche, one not particularly well served by streaming services.“If our optimism is misplaced or overstated,” Mr. Pascucci said of the classical material, “then at worst you have a large and very stable catalog.”For Concord Bicycle, the Imagem acquisition will cap a busy period of deal making. Four years ago, Wood Creek Capital Management, a private equity affiliate of MassMutual, bought the Concord Music Group, a record label that had built a business catering to adult tastes with Paul McCartney, the Stax soul catalog and a joint label with Starbucks. (Concord Bicycle is now owned by Barings Alternative Investments, the successor to Wood Creek; Sound Investors, led by the media executive Stephen Smith; and others.)Then, in 2015, Concord merged with the Bicycle Music Company, a publisher, and the combined company made a series of deals for new kinds of music: Wind-Up Records and Razor & Tie brought hard rock and the popular “Kidz Bop” series; a deal for Musart added Latin music; a deal with the music executive Tom Whalley for his label Loma Vista added alternative acts like St. Vincent; and there was a partnership with Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Really Useful Group.The Imagem deal is the latest in a frothy market for music publishing, the side of the business that deals in the copyrights for songwriting and composition. With the recorded music business shaken by digital disruption, investors have viewed publishing catalogs as a safer investment. The owners of these rights collect money whenever songs are played on the radio, streamed online or used in film and television.The acquisition of Imagem will also add to Concord Bicycle’s overhead, since Imagem’s theatrical, classical and pop catalogs are managed as distinct business units, with their own staff. Concord Bicycle will now have more than 350 employees, and its relatively small publishing division of about 25 people, run by Jake Wisely, will gain more than 100 people as part of the deal.In an interview, Mr. Pascucci emphasized the efficiency of Concord Bicycle’s operation, drawing an elaborate organizational chart on a scrap of paper. Like a major label, he explained, his company has specialized record divisions and a central team for promotion and sales.“The way we think about our business,” he said, “is we want to have the potential impact and firepower of a major label, but we are an indie.”"
"Exxon Emissions Costs Accounting ‘May Be a Sham,’ New York State Says","For years, Exxon Mobil has insisted that its investment decisions take into account what carbon pollution will eventually cost the company.But according to court filings by the New York State attorney general’s office, there is new evidence that the company has not actually followed that course, potentially overstating the value of its assets and defrauding its shareholders.According to the filings, made by the state on Friday, “evidence suggests not only that Exxon’s public statements about its risk management practices were false and misleading, but also that Exxon may still be in the midst of perpetrating an ongoing fraudulent scheme on investors and the public.”The filings come in a long investigation by the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, into whether Exxon lied to investors and consumers about the risks of climate change and how those risks might hurt its business. The investigation has its roots in a report the company released in 2014 in response to shareholder pressure to disclose how vulnerable its assets could be to future climate regulations.The issue resurfaced this week when a majority of shareholders approved a measure asking for a more open and detailed accounting.The central question is how Exxon values the fossil fuels it owns but has yet to extract. Climate scientists have suggested that if the world were to burn even just a portion of the oil in the ground that the industry declares on its books, the planet would heat up to catastrophic levels — an argument that has been boiled down to the slogan “keep it in the ground.”By that logic, if policies aimed at slowing global warming mean that Exxon has to leave those reserves in the ground, their declared value could be far too high.According to the filings, starting in 2010, Exxon told its investors that it used one set of estimates known as proxy costs while a set of lower costs was used internally in business planning.Exxon Mobil rejected the assertions.“For many years, Exxon Mobil has applied a proxy cost of carbon to its investment opportunities, where appropriate, in order to anticipate the aggregate financial impact of future government policies,” it said in a statement. “Exxon Mobil’s external statements have accurately described its use of a proxy cost of carbon, and the documents produced to the attorney general make this fact unmistakably clear.”The state’s filings on Friday asserted that Exxon’s public estimates for projects in developed countries set the proxy costs at $60 a ton of greenhouse gases by 2030 and $80 a ton by 2040, while internally the company assumed the price reached only $40 a ton by 2030.The filings show that an Exxon climate change manager wrote in a 2010 email that the higher figures were “more realistic,” but that Rex W. Tillerson, then chief executive, approved of the accounting discrepancy and wrote in an email in 2011 that he was “happy with the difference.” Mr. Tillerson left the company late last year to become secretary of state in the Trump administration.Mr. Schneiderman’s office asserts that there is little evidence that the company applied even the lower figures, with only one instance of a price being used in the documents the company turned over.“It appears that Exxon’s proxy-cost risk-management process may be a sham,” John Oleske, senior enforcement counsel to the attorney general’s office, wrote in one of the filings.In response to subpoenas, the company has provided at least 400,000 documents totaling millions of pages. But the filings argue that more are needed to determine the accuracy of Exxon’s calculations about how future regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions would affect the value of its investments.Exxon Mobil has argued in court that the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts are conducting a “highly politicized and bad-faith investigation.” The company, accused of conspiring to cloud the issue of climate change through surrogate groups, argues that the investigators are conspirators because they consulted with environmentalists, including the Rockefeller family.Mr. Schneiderman has said that his efforts constitute a straightforward securities fraud investigation like those he has undertaken concerning Wall Street companies and another climate change suit that led to a 2015 settlement with Peabody Energy."
Trump Said to Pick Nominees for 2 Positions on Fed Board,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has selected candidates for at least two of the three open positions on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, according to people with direct knowledge of the decision.The expected nominees include Randal K. Quarles, a Treasury Department official in the George W. Bush administration, and Marvin Goodfriend, a former Fed official who is now a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University.In picking Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend, President Trump is seeking to install conservative counterweights to the Fed’s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen. Both men have expressed reservations about the Fed’s aggressive efforts to revive economic growth since the 2008 crisis.Mr. Quarles would also become a leading figure in the administration’s efforts to roll back financial regulation. He would be nominated to serve as the Fed’s vice chairman for supervision, with responsibility for overseeing the Fed’s regulatory responsibilities.It is not clear when the administration intends to announce the nominations, according to the people, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential conversations. Until that happens, it remains possible that Mr. Trump could decide to reopen the search process.Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend did not return calls requesting comment. “We have no announcement at this time,” said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman.Mr. Quarles, 59, is a managing director at the Cynosure Group, a private equity firm based in Salt Lake City. His wife’s great-uncle is Marriner Eccles, the Fed’s chairman from 1934 to 1948 and the namesake of the Fed’s marble headquarters on the National Mall in Washington, where Mr. Quarles would have an office.Mr. Quarles was a lawyer for the financial industry before joining the Bush administration in 2002, first as assistant secretary for international affairs and then as under secretary for domestic finance. After leaving the administration in 2006, he became a partner at the Carlyle Group before helping to found Cynosure in 2014.At the Fed, Mr. Quarles would take the place of Daniel Tarullo, who led the Fed’s push to tighten financial regulation after the 2008 crisis, though he was never formally nominated to serve as the vice chairman for supervision.Mr. Quarles is regarded as significantly more sympathetic than Mr. Tarullo to the industry’s concerns that regulation is overly restrictive, limiting economic growth.In a 2015 interview with Bloomberg Television, he said some postcrisis changes in regulation “aren’t well designed and were included for political rather than financial-regulatory reasons.” In a 2016 opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Quarles argued that it was misguided to focus on the size of the largest banks.One of Mr. Quarles’s major tasks at the Fed would be overseeing the annual “stress test"" of large banks, intended to make sure that they can weather a crisis.But his influence would be constrained, at least in the short term, because Ms. Yellen played a key role in developing those regulations. Ms. Yellen’s term ends in February 2018, creating the next Fed personnel decision confronting Mr. Trump.Mr. Goodfriend, 66, is a leading figure among conservative economists who study monetary policy. He worked for more than 20 years as an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond; for more than half of that time, he was the chief monetary policy adviser to the bank’s president, a member of the Fed’s policy committee.He left the bank in 2005 to join the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University.Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend have expressed support for the idea that the Federal Reserve should adopt a more formulaic approach to policy-making. House Republicans have proposed legislation that would require the Fed to articulate a policy rule — a mathematical approach to determining the level of interest rates — that would limit the role of human judgment in monetary policy.“If you’re going to be transparent in an activity like the Fed, you have to be much more rule-based in what you’re doing,” Mr. Quarles told Bloomberg Television in 2015. He described the Fed’s current approach as “a crazy way to run a railroad.”Mr. Goodfriend endorsed that approach in March testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. He said adopting such a rule was necessary “to improve the discipline” of monetary policy and constrain inflation.Mr. Goodfriend is also a critic of the Fed’s asset purchases in the wake of the financial crisis. The Fed amassed more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Mr. Goodfriend has said that the Fed should not purchase mortgage bonds, because doing so promotes economic growth in a particular sector — the kind of judgment that should be left to those who determine fiscal policy.The Fed has operated in recent years without a full complement of seven governors. The board oversees regulatory policy, and the governors also hold permanent votes on the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy.By law, the Fed’s board must include at least one person with community banking experience, and two of the people with direct knowledge of the process said that a number of candidates with that background have been interviewed in recent weeks. It is not clear, however, where a decision on filling the community-banking governor opening now stands."
Even Good Drivers May Be Hampered by Stigma of High-Risk Insurance,"Good drivers covered by high-risk automobile insurers may find it hard to overcome that stigma when seeking new coverage from a standard insurer, a new analysis suggests.Drivers who switch from a high-risk or “nonstandard” auto insurer to a large standard insurer may be quoted higher rates, even if they have safe driving records, according to the analysis by the Consumer Federation of America.Three major mainstream insurers often quote such drivers significantly higher premiums, compared with quotes for drivers who were previously insured by large standard insurers, the analysis found.The practice may particularly harm drivers in low- and moderate-income communities, making it difficult for them to find affordable insurance rates, said Douglas Heller, an insurance consultant who conducted the study for the federation. Often, he said, drivers in low-income or underserved areas have few options other than nonstandard insurers, even if they themselves have clean driving records. But once they are covered by nonstandard policies, they may be penalized if they try to move to mainstream coverage, he said.For the analysis, Mr. Heller and an associate tested whether quotes in 20 cities from seven large insurers differed depending on whether the customer seeking the quote was switching from a smaller nonstandard insurer. The researchers sought quotes for a hypothetical female driver with a perfect driving record; first, they said her prior coverage was with a major insurer (State Farm), then they said her coverage was with a nonstandard company.In a majority of cities where quotes were available, three major companies — Allstate, Farmers and American Family — used a driver’s previous insurer as a factor in determining the new premium quoted, the study found.In those cities, Allstate quoted a rate that was 15 percent more on average for a good driver who had previously been covered by high-risk carriers like Safe Auto Insurance and Equity Insurance, compared with State Farm.Farmers and American Family both charged 9 percent more on average for prior coverage through nonstandard insurers, compared with State Farm.In one example, the federation found that Allstate quoted a driver in Queens an annual premium of nearly $4,200 when the prior insurer was State Farm. But Allstate quoted the driver more than $5,000 when the prior insurer was one of two nonstandard carriers.“If one’s driving experience shows that he or she is low-risk,” Mr. Heller said, “then it does not make sense to use the fact that she was previously insured with a nonstandard company against her.”The federation did not have data on how often drivers switch.The analysis also found that practices varied by insurer and by market. Allstate raised rates on some customers coming from nonstandard insurers in 12 cities, but it actually lowered rates in three cities (Pittsburgh, Seattle and Tampa, Fla.).In some cases, the impact was highly localized; Geico quoted rates as much as 72 percent higher in Tampa for drivers who previously had coverage through a nonstandard carrier, but did not use such information to price policies in any other city tested. (Geico declined to comment.)Three large companies — State Farm, Progressive and Liberty Mutual — did not increase rates at all in relation to drivers’ prior insurance companies, the study found.Allstate’s pricing “has been and continues to be determined by risk and costs,” said Justin Herndon, a company spokesman, adding, “Insurance prices are risk-based so that lower-risk drivers pay less than higher-risk drivers.” Allstate does not consider factors like income or race when setting insurance rates, he said.Linda Wagener, a spokeswoman for American Family, said in an email that a driver’s prior insurance from a nonstandard carrier was “one of many factors” used in determining auto premiums. Data show that customers moving from a nonstandard policy have a higher likelihood of future losses than those who come from a standard policy, she said. “As a result,” she said, “their rates are different, to reflect the different levels of risk.”Farmers did not respond to a request for comment.Nonstandard insurers sell about $7.5 billion in auto insurance in the United States, representing about 7 percent of the auto insurance market, according to the federation.David Snyder, vice president for policy development and research with the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, said the federation’s analysis showed that insurers use a “wide diversity” of practices when considering a driver’s prior coverage, suggesting a competitive market. “It shows the companies are not all doing it the same way,” he said.The report is the latest in a series of analyses by the federation, highlighting ways in which lower- and moderate-income consumers may be affected by the use of various nondriving-related criteria to set auto insurance rates.Here are some questions and answers about auto insurance:How can I find the lowest premium when switching from a nonstandard auto insurer?Because the use of prior-insurer coverage varies in setting rates, it makes sense to obtain quotes from several insurers, Mr. Heller said. It’s now easy to obtain quotes from companies online, but he advises calling two or three local agents as well.Are there other costs, besides premiums, that I should consider?Make sure to ask about fees, not just premiums, Mr. Heller said. Particularly with nonstandard insurers, there are often “policy fees” of $30 to $50 to buy coverage, and extra fees if you pay in installments or add an additional car to the policy later. After getting a quote, he said, “make sure you know all the hidden costs before you decide which company is giving you the best price.”Do all states permit insurers to consider nondriving-related criteria to be used in setting auto rates?Some states bar the use of credit history, or of an applicant’s occupation and educational level, in setting rates. Gov. Andrew Cuomo last month proposed banning the use of education and occupation in setting rates in New York, unless insurers can provide proof to the state’s Department of Financial Services that the criteria do not result in rates that are “unfairly discriminatory.” The proposal is subject to a 45-day comment period.“Good drivers shouldn’t be penalized with higher premiums just because they have a lower-paying job or may not have gone to college,” said Chuck Bell, a policy analyst for Consumers Union, which supports the proposal.The change, however, could have negative consequences for some drivers, Mr. Snyder said. For instance, it might prevent insurers from offering popular “good driver” discounts to certain people based on occupation, as they often do with teachers."
Blue Apron Has a Good Product. Beware of the Stock.,"Blue Apron, the meal-kit delivery company that wants to go public, serves up delicious meals and tantalizing sales growth. But look closely at the ingredients. New-customer acquisition costs are surging, customers are ordering fewer meals, and competitors abound. Like Groupon before it, Blue Apron is a case where the product is fine but the stock is best avoided.The idea is simple and appealing: Deliver easily prepared meals to clients’ doors. Young professionals and harried homemakers can appreciate not having to stop at stores or draw up menus. Budding cooks can try out new dishes. Customers with few restaurant options nearby can try out cool recipes. All of this helps explain why Blue Apron — which wisely changed its name from Petridish Media in 2012 — has over one million customers and increased its first-quarter revenue 42 percent to $245 million.Yet similar services are proliferating wildly. Over a dozen such companies have raised cash from venture capitalists, and multiple supermarket chains have jumped into the act. Promises of a better food system and organic ingredients, as Blue Apron offers, are de rigueur. New entrants increasingly specialize in niches like Paleolithic and gluten-free diets. Fit New England Patriots fans can even order Tom Brady meals for optimal athletic performance.That’s making it harder to find and presumably keep customers. Over the past year, marketing costs as a percentage of net revenue have risen to 25 percent from 15 percent at Blue Apron. At the same time, the number and size of orders per customer fell. The company lost $52 million in the first quarter — almost as much as it lost in all of 2016.Cutting back on big coupons, numerous podcasts it sponsors and other advertising would raise Blue Apron’s margins, but growth would take a big hit. Frugal users can copy dishes with the recipes provided, and numerous rivals offer discounts. Savvy customers already play off meal-kit companies against one another and form clubs to “recommend” services to each other for free meals.Potential shareholders will also have little control over their destiny. The company will have three classes of stock, one nonvoting, one with one vote and another offering insiders 10 votes per share. Blue Apron’s food is plenty tasty, but investors should prepare for a less appetizing experience."
Here’s How a Chinese Tech Firm Borrowed $2.1 Billion in a Hurry,"When a Chinese tech company with global ambitions began to run short of cash last year, it sought billions of dollars from new investors. One of them was a music teacher.Li Shenghong, who teaches out of a mall storefront in southern China, was already a fan of the smartphones and televisions sold by the company, an internet-and-gadgets conglomerate called LeEco. When LeEco also began selling investment products online, Mr. Li snapped them up, even though the company said little about where the money would go.“Whenever I have leftover money from my salary, I’ll invest it,” Mr. Li said, explaining that he had invested $7,000 in the company. “My spare change? I put it in.”LeEco, buffeted by rapid expansion, has turned to murky and potentially risky ways to stay afloat, including tapping China’s shadowy informal banking system, which many people believe threatens the Chinese economy. The company courted small investors by promising good rates of return and playing down risks.All the while, its finances were deteriorating. Even as it continued to raise money, LeEco filled the lobby of its offices with potted plants to keep angry creditors from loitering there.Economists worry that Chinese companies are borrowing too much money outside the scrutiny of regulators and planting too many potential debt bombs in the corners of China’s financial system. On May 24, Moody’s Investors Service lowered its China rating, citing the country’s mounting corporate debt.China is taking steps to address the issue. President Xi Jinping told top ministers in April to stabilize the country’s financial system. Still, solving the debt problem could require drastic action.“The problems are real, but manageable,” said Arthur R. Kroeber, the head of research at Gavekal Dragonomics, an economic research firm based in Beijing. “The government needs to start managing them.”LeEco, a catchall name for a variety of businesses controlled by the internet tycoon Jia Yueting, poses little threat by itself to China’s financial system. But a review of the company’s finances shows the extent of the opaque ways Chinese firms can use to raise money — and how failures could ripple through the system.A spokeswoman said LeEco’s efforts to raise money complied with the law. Mr. Jia declined requests for an interview.LeEco began as an online video-streaming company sometimes called the Netflix of China. Today, its many affiliates sell smartphones and TVs, buy up sports programming, peddle financial products and back the Faraday Future electric car business, which is based in Los Angeles and employs 1,400 people.To borrow more than $2.1 billion since the start of last year, LeEco affiliates have turned to China’s vast but poorly understood informal financial system.LeEco raised $215 million from selling so-called wealth management products online, according to public data. In China, such investments promise a good rate of return and the illusion of a guarantee, but they offer little disclosure. LeEco listed the products on its app as “low risk.”Mr. Li, the music teacher, bought LeEco wealth management products that promised an annualized return of up to 7 percent. He is not concerned about getting his money back.“I’m not too interested in where the money is going,” he said. “I have a Le TV and a Le phone. I’m not worried.”LeEco also tapped securities brokerages for money, another murky transaction. Under such deals, the brokerages lend money if a borrower puts up shares as collateral. Those loans stay off the books of the formal banking system, making risks difficult to track. They can also sour quickly if shares plunge in value, a real possibility in China’s stock market.According to the latest available data, Mr. Jia has pledged 97 percent of his shares in LeEco’s main publicly traded arm, Leshi Internet, to back loans primarily from securities brokerages. In November, those loans totaled $1.7 billion.Venturing into other corners of China’s financial system, LeEco has raised $2.4 billion since last year by selling shares or debt convertible into shares in its various privately owned affiliates. Because those businesses are not publicly traded, they get less scrutiny from Chinese securities regulators than companies that sell shares on a public stock market.LeEco says it sold those stakes only to institutional investors who would be aware of the risks. But public records show shares in the nonpublic businesses have ended up in the hands of a number of smaller investors. Many were lured by the idea of getting in early — a real desire in start-up-mad China — and Mr. Jia’s promise that he or his investment vehicles would buy back the shares at a generous rate of return if the businesses did not go public.Mo Lingmei was among nearly 400 people to buy stakes in Le Sports, a LeEco affiliate that acquires sports broadcasting rights such as the right to show Premier League soccer online in China. Ms. Mo, who sells clothes online, said she drained her family’s savings to come up with half of the $300,000 that a group of friends pooled together to invest in the company’s $1.2 billion funding round last year.“It was an impulse decision,” she said, adding that Mr. Jia “was so hot at the time, on TV, in the media, in the paper. I’d never invested in anything before.”Many of the company’s problems have lingered. Last month, LeEco laid off 325 workers in the United States. Some affiliates have started new fund-raising efforts.In April, 37 representatives of small suppliers demanded that they be repaid $10 million owed to them by a LeEco affiliate. They staged a weeklong sit-in in the lobby of LeEco’s office tower in Beijing, until large potted plants were placed in the sitting area. At LeEco’s ride-sharing affiliate, Yidao Yongche, drivers have had trouble getting paid for weeks and have started protesting at several of the company’s offices across China.LeEco says it is on the mend, citing a $2.2 billion injection in January from a Chinese real estate developer. At an investor meeting in May, Mr. Jia acknowledged that layoffs and asset sales were underway but said the moves would “allow our core operations, especially the nonpublic businesses, to enter a fast-paced recovery period.”Mr. Jia’s commitment has reassured a number of investors, including Hu Yenan, who has formed a company to bring people together and pour money into the conglomerate’s various businesses.One partnership Mr. Hu formed bought into a $1.08 billion offering of debt convertible into shares in LeEco’s electric car start-ups, Faraday Future and LeSee. Mr. Jia, he noted, had personally guaranteed the debt.“If Warren Buffett comes to you asking for money, would you lend to him?” Mr. Hu asked. “Of course you would.”"
"No, Your Phone Didn’t Ring. So Why Voice Mail From a Telemarketer?","Frank Kemp was working on his computer when his cellphone let out the sound of Mario — from Super Mario Bros. — collecting a coin. That signaled he had a new voice mail message, yet his phone had never rung.“At first, I thought I was crazy,” said Mr. Kemp, a video editor in Dover, Del. “When I checked my voice mail, it made me really angry. It was literally a telemarketing voice mail to try to sell telemarketing systems.”Mr. Kemp had just experienced a technology gaining traction called ringless voice mail, the latest attempt by telemarketers and debt collectors to reach the masses. The calls are quietly deposited through a back door, directly into a voice mail box — to the surprise and (presumably) irritation of the recipient, who cannot do anything to block them.Regulators are considering whether to ban these messages. They have been hearing from ringless voice mail providers and pro-business groups, which argue that these messages should not qualify as calls and, therefore, should be exempt from consumer protection laws that ban similar types of telephone marketing.But consumer advocates, technology experts, people who have been inundated with these calls and the lawyers representing them say such an exemption would open the floodgates. Consumers’ voice mail boxes would be clogged with automated messages, they say, making it challenging to unearth important calls, whether they are from an elderly mother’s nursing home or a child’s school.If unregulated, ringless voice mail messages “will likely overwhelm consumers’ voice mail systems and consumers will have no way to limit, control or stop these messages,” Margot Freeman Saunders, senior counsel at the National Consumer Law Center, wrote in the organization’s comment letter to the Federal Communications Commission on behalf of more than a dozen consumer groups. “Debt collectors could potentially hijack a consumer’s voice mail with collection messages.”The commission is collecting public comments on the issue after receiving a petition from a ringless voice mail provider that wants to avoid regulation under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. That federal law among other things prohibits calling cellular phones with automated dialing and artificial or prerecorded voices without first obtaining consent — except in an emergency.All About the Message, the ringless voice mail provider petitioning the commission, uses technology developed by another company, Stratics Networks. All About the Message’s customers use the service to deliver messages for marketing or other purposes right to consumers.Will Wiquist, a spokesman for the F.C.C., said the commission would review the record after the public comment period closed and consider a decision. There is no formal timeline for resolving such petitions, and the commission cannot comment on the petition until a ruling is issued.“They are all poised to launch a cannon full of calls to consumers,” said Peter F. Barry, a consumer lawyer in Minneapolis. “If there is no liability for it, it will be a new law that needs to get passed very quickly.”Even consumers on the “Do Not Call” list could potentially be bombarded by telemarketers, advocates said. “The legal question is whether the people sending the messages would be required to comply with the Do Not Call list,” Ms. Saunders said. “We read the law to possibly not apply if they are not considered calls.”This is not the first time the commission has received such a request. Nearly three years ago, it received a similar petition from VoAPPs, another voice mail technology company, which wanted to allow debt collectors to reach consumers through voice mail. But the petition was withdrawn before the commission could rule.More specifically, All About the Message wants the F.C.C. to rule that its voice mail messages are not calls, and therefore can be delivered by automatic telephone dialing systems using an artificial or prerecorded voice. In its petition, the company argued that the law “does not impose liability for voice mail messages” when they are delivered directly to a voice mail service provider and subscribers are not charged for a call.“The act of depositing a voice mail on a voice mail service without dialing a consumers’ cellular telephone line does not result in the kind of disruptions to a consumer’s life — dead air calls, calls interrupting consumers at inconvenient times or delivery charges to consumers,” All About the Message wrote. The company’s lawyer declined to comment.If the commission rules against it, All About the Message said, it wants a retroactive waiver to relieve the company and its customers of any liability and “potentially substantial damages” for voice mail already delivered.The company has reason to ask. Even though it started business just last year, one of All About the Message’s customers — an auto dealer — is already facing a lawsuit involving a consumer who received repeated messages. Tom Mahoney, who said he received four voice mail messages from Naples Nissan in 2016, is the lead plaintiff in a suit filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.According to the suit, the parties in the case have reached a tentative agreement to settle all claims. Lawyers for both Mr. Mahoney and Naples Nissan declined to comment.The suit said that Mr. Mahoney’s daughter had received similar messages — advertising zero-interest auto financing — and that neither he nor she had given the company consent.Josh Justice, chief executive of Stratics Networks, said its technology — which can send out 100 ringless voice mail messages a minute — had existed for 10 years and had not caused a widespread nuisance. It was intended for businesses like hospitals, dentist’s and doctor's offices, banks, and shipping companies to reach customers, for example, and for “responsible marketing.”“The concept of ringless voice mail was to develop a nonnuisance form of messaging or a nonintrusive alternative to robocalls,” Mr. Justice said.He contends that telemarketers should be able to use ringless voice mail messages as long as they do so responsibly — that is, skipping over consumers on the “Do Not Call” list, identifying who is leaving the message and giving people a way to opt out. But he said he did not believe that ringless voice mail needed to be subject to the same regulations as other calls — unless regulators find that the messages are generating complaints or being used inappropriately.Consumer advocates and other experts argue that the courts and the F.C.C. have already established that technology similar to ringless voice mail — which delivered mass automated texts to cellphones — was deemed the same as calls and was covered by the consumer protection law.“These companies are only spinning an incorrect interpretation of the regulations and the definition of the word ‘call,’” said Randall Snyder, a telecommunications engineering consultant and expert witness in more than 100 cases involving related regulations.“Definitions of words in regulations and statutes are legal issues,” he said, “but there is certainly lots of common sense here.”The Republican National Committee, which is in favor of ringless voice mail, goes as far as to argue that prohibiting direct-to-voice-mail messages may be a violation of free speech. Telephone outreach campaigns, it said, are a core part of political activism.“Political organizations like the R.N.C. use all manner of communications to discuss political and governmental issues and to solicit donations — including direct-to-voice-mail messages,” the committee said in its letter to the commission.For now, consumers who receive these messages can file complaints with regulators; they can also provide comments on whether they believe ringless voice mail should be subject to consumer protection rules.But Ms. Saunders said blocking messages might be impossible: It is the phone that blocks calls, and these messages go right to voice mail. (More advice — on how to register for the “Do Not Call” list and how to avoid robocalls and texts — can be found on the F.C.C. website.)Justin T. Holcombe, a consumer lawyer and partner at Skaar & Feagle in Woodstock, Ga., said the commission’s ruling would have implications for just about everyone. If ringless voice mail could avoid consumer protection rules, “it would be a free-for-all,” he said.Mr. Kemp, the video editor in Delaware who received the ringless voice mail message, said in recent weeks that he had been targeted by robocallers advertising vehicle financing, even though he owns his truck outright. His strategy? He goes through the menu prompts, acting as if he were interested; when he finally reaches a live person, he angrily demands that his number be removed from the caller’s list.“Hasn’t worked yet,” he said, “but it’s a good stress reliever.”"
"Jean Sammet, Co-Designer of a Pioneering Computer Language, Dies at 89","Jean E. Sammet, an early software engineer and a designer of COBOL, a programming language that brought computing into the business mainstream, died on May 20 in Maryland. She was 89.She lived in a retirement community in Silver Spring and died at a nearby hospital after a brief illness, said Elizabeth Conlisk, a spokeswoman for Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, where Ms. Sammet had earned her undergraduate degree and later endowed a professorship in computer science.The programming language Ms. Sammet helped bring to life is now more than a half-century old, but billions of lines of COBOL code still run on the mainframe computers that underpin the work of corporations and government agencies around the world.Ms. Sammet was a graduate student in mathematics when she first encountered a computer in 1949 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She wasn’t impressed.“I thought of a computer as some obscene piece of hardware that I wanted nothing to do with,” Ms. Sammet recalled in an interview in 2000.Her initial aversion was not unusual among the math purists of the time, long before computer science emerged as an academic discipline. Later, Ms. Sammet tried programming calculations onto cardboard punched cards, which were then fed into a computer.“To my utter astonishment,” she said, “I loved it.”In the early 1950s, the computer industry was in its infancy, with no settled culture or rigid career paths. Lois Haibt, a contemporary of Ms. Sammet’s at IBM, where Ms. Sammet worked for nearly three decades, observed, “They took anyone who seemed to have an aptitude for problem-solving skills — bridge players, chess players, even women.”Ms. Sammet became one of the most prominent women of her generation in computing. Her deepest interest was in programming languages and using them to open computing to a wider audience. Her ambition, Ben Shneiderman, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland, recalled her saying, was “to put every person in communication with the computer.”Jean E. Sammet was born on March 23, 1928, in New York City. Both her parents, Harry and Ruth Sammet, were lawyers. Jean excelled in math starting in the first grade and chose to attend college at Mount Holyoke because it had an excellent mathematics department.Her programming career included stints at Sperry Gyroscope and its successor Sperry Rand, and Sylvania Electric before she joined IBM in 1961. She was also a historian and advocate for her profession. Her book, “Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals,” published in 1969, “was, and remains, a classic” in the field, said Dag Spicer, senior curator of the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif.In 1974, Ms. Sammet became the first female president of the Association for Computing Machinery, a leading professional association in computer science. She held the post for two years.Yet her most enduring legacy is the role she played in the creation and longevity of COBOL. By the end of the 1950s, it was becoming clear that computers could be powerful tools not only for scientific calculations but also in business — helping to manage accounting, payroll, purchasing and manufacturing operations. That led to the creation of the Common Business Oriented Language, or COBOL — a means to handle not just numbers, but also business data.The United States Department of Defense, the largest purchaser of computers at the time, set general guidelines for COBOL, including asking for “the maximum use of simple English” to “broaden the base of those who can state problems to computers.” Later, the Pentagon declared it would not buy or lease computers unless they ran COBOL.Grace Hopper, a computer pioneer at Sperry Rand in the late 1950s, led the effort to bring computer makers together to collaborate on the new programming language. Ms. Hopper is often called the “mother of COBOL,” but she was not one of the six people, including Ms. Sammet, who designed the language — a fact Ms. Sammet rarely failed to point out. (Ms. Sammet worked for Sylvania Electric at the time.)“I yield to no one in my admiration for Grace,” she said. “But she was not the mother, creator or developer of COBOL.”Ms. Sammet and the other five programmers did much of the new language’s design during two weeks of nearly round-the-clock work, holed up in the Sherry-Netherland Hotel in Manhattan. Their proposal was presented in November 1959 and accepted with few changes by the computer makers they worked for and the Pentagon.COBOL, particularly the early versions, allowed programmers the freedom to write code without much structure, leading to complex, sprawling programs scorned as so-called spaghetti code. Academics were often dismissive. In 1975, Edsger Dijkstra, a prominent computer scientist, wrote, “The use of COBOL cripples the mind.”But COBOL was innovative for its time in the techniques it used to describe and represent data in computer code. It provided software to organize basic data on customers or citizens, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and phone numbers. Brian Kernighan, a computer scientist at Princeton University, said COBOL “really was very good at handling formatted data.”As it evolved, Ms. Sammet pushed to inject more engineering discipline into the language to make it more useful and reliable in industries like banking, health care and retailing, and for government agencies.Grady Booch, chief scientist for software engineering at IBM Research, said “Jean Sammet was a strong, consistent voice of integrity in those efforts.”She leaves no immediate survivors.COBOL was initially intended as a short-term solution to the problem of handling business data — a technology that might be useful for a year or two until something better came along. But it has lived on. More than 200 billion lines of COBOL code are now in use and an estimated 2 billion lines are added or changed each year, according to IBM Research."
"After London Attack, Trump Again the Center of Partisan Media Combat","A CNN host called President Trump a “man baby” and a piece of excrement. (He used a more profane term, and later apologized.) A guest on “Fox & Friends” proposed that some Muslims in the United Kingdom be placed in internment camps, prompting an on-air disavowal from the hosts.A Breitbart News writer argued on Twitter that “there would be no deadly attacks in the U.K. if Muslims didn’t live there,” generating angry replies. And Mr. Trump himself, in his first public comment about the attack in London on Saturday night, disseminated unconfirmed information from an unofficial source: The Drudge Report.In the 24 hours after the deadly van and knife attack, the cycle of partisan broadsides and ideological combat that seems to dominate the media universe these days kicked into high gear.News organizations turned against each other, with anchors on Fox News calling on CNN to punish its host Reza Aslan for his profane remarks about Mr. Trump in a Twitter post.The president’s retweet of a Drudge headline — “fears of new terror attack,” it read, even as the nature of the assault remained unclear — prompted a rebuke of sorts from NBC Nightly News, whose Twitter account pointedly noted that its journalists would not relay the president’s retweet, “as the info is unconfirmed.”That led to accusations of liberal bias, with the “Fox & Friends” co-host Abby Huntsman asking, “Can we not just come together?”It was the kind of chain reaction that is increasingly commonplace in a deeply polarized political environment, where news organizations attract tribal followings, and where major events like the London attack can stoke fears and inflame emotions — from Mr. Trump on down.Mr. Aslan responded with his angry posts after the president, in the immediate wake of the attack on Saturday, wrote on Twitter that his proposed travel ban was needed to prevent terrorism. Mr. Aslan, an Iranian-American writer and religion scholar who hosts a weekly show about faith and society for CNN, also described Mr. Trump as “an embarrassment to humankind.”That prompted expressions of outrage from right-wing news outlets like Breitbart News and the hosts of “Fox & Friends” on Sunday morning, who lamented his comment. CNN was already mired in an uproar over the comedian Kathy Griffin, a co-host of the network’s New Year’s Eve coverage, who posted a photograph in which she held a fake severed head meant to look like the president’s; CNN severed ties with Ms. Griffin last week.“I should have used better language to express my shock and frustration at the president’s lack of decorum and sympathy,” Mr. Aslan wrote in a statement on Sunday. “I apologize for my choice of words.” (A spokeswoman for CNN added: “That kind of discourse is never appropriate.”)The backlash against Mr. Trump’s tweets, however, went beyond Mr. Aslan. Critics pointed to the president’s criticism of London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, noting that Mr. Trump had taken a quote from the mayor out of context to suggest that he was unconcerned about terrorism.There was also some disbelief in online comments that the president, who has access to up-to-the-minute national intelligence, chose to send a speculative item from The Drudge Report to his 31.5 million Twitter followers on an issue of international import. The Drudge Report, which is hugely popular with conservatives, counts Mr. Trump among its devotees: @Drudge_Report is just one of 45 Twitter accounts that he follows.On “Fox & Friends,” a reliably Trump-friendly morning show, there was little concern over the president’s tweets, but some criticism of Mr. Aslan’s remark, which the hosts described as evidence of an explicit bias against Mr. Trump in some quarters of the news media.It was not long until the “Fox & Friends” crew was coping with its own troubles.One of the show’s guest commentators, Katie Hopkins of The Daily Mail, raised the prospect of rounding up Muslims on the terrror watch list in the United Kingdom and placing them in internment camps as a way of preventing future attacks. Another guest — Nigel Farage, the British political figure and “Brexit” advocate  who is now a Fox News contributor — also mentioned the idea of internment.Later in the broadcast, the “Fox & Friends” anchors paused for a formal denunciation of the statements, lest viewers be left with the impression that Fox was endorsing the idea.“On behalf of the network, I think all of us here find that idea reprehensible here at Fox News Channel, just to be clear,” a co-host, Clayton Morris, told viewers.Ms. Huntsman added, “It’s important to be said.”"
Morning Agenda: 4 Mideast Countries Sever Ties to Qatar,"Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have severed diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of fueling extremism and terrorism.All four countries also suspended travel to and from Qatar.The reaction so far: Oil prices are up; Qatar’s stock market is down.The Wall Street Journal reports that oil traders are looking to see whether Qatar maintains agreed-upon reductions in production and that gas traders are on high alert as well.The coordinated effort to isolate Qatar underlines other Arab countries’ disapproval of its support for the Muslim Brotherhood and accusations that Doha supports Iran’s agenda. Bloomberg has an explainer here.Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said the United States would encourage the Gulf Cooperation Council to help resolve the situation. “We certainly would encourage the parties to sit down together and address these differences,” he said, adding, “we think it is important that the G.C.C. remain unified.”Just like many other banks, Vnesheconombank has a presence on Wall Street: It has an office in a Manhattan skyscraper, bonds available to investors and ties to major American lenders.But Vnesheconombank, the Russian state-owned lender known as VEB, is under greater scrutiny these days.VEB’s chief, Sergey N. Gorkov — a prominent graduate of Russia’s spy school — met with Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, during the presidential transition.That meeting is a focus of a federal counterintelligence investigation about possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.Three years ago, in response to Moscow’s military intervention in Ukraine, the Obama administration imposed sanctions on VEB that have prevented it from taking on most new business in the United States.Since then, the bank has quietly kept up appearances on Wall Street in case sanctions are to be lifted, according to interviews with American bankers and former government officials.But not everyone is convinced that the bank is just a bank.One of them is Karen Vartapetov, a public finance analyst at Standard & Poor’s, who said: “We should rather treat this bank as a government agency. It is used by the government as a tool to invest in politically and socially important but not always financially viable projects.”The founder of Oculus VR, a start-up making virtual-reality equipment, is back.Palmer Freeman Luckey became something of a persona non grata in Silicon Valley after news spread that he had secretly donated to an anti-Hillary Clinton organization. But, espousing his politics more freely now, he is working on a start-up that is developing surveillance technology to monitor borders between countries and around military bases, according to three people familiar with the plan.They say that Mr. Luckey believes his system, which can be mounted on telephone poles, can be built far more cost effectively than Mr. Trump’s proposed wall on the Mexican border.They also said that the investment fund run by Peter Thiel, a technology adviser to Mr. Trump, planned to support the effort.In an emailed statement, Mr. Luckey confirmed that he was working on a defense-related start-up.“We need a new kind of defense company, one that will save taxpayer dollars while creating superior technology to keep our troops and citizens safer,” he said.“I do believe General Motors is a tech company.” — Mary T. Barra, chief executive of General Motors, on the automaker’s efforts to be at the forefront in the development of self-driving cars. The company is trying to fend off a campaign by Greenlight Capital to create two classes of its stock, a fight that will culminate on Tuesday at G.M.’s annual shareholder meeting.• Apple will show off its latest software and hardware, including Macs and iPads, at its annual conference for developers."
How to Perfect the Art of a Work Uniform,"My closet looks exactly like Donald Duck’s: two dozen identical white shirts all in a row.About three years ago I decided to start wearing a uniform to the office, so I went to J. Crew and ordered three of the same suit in the same fabric and a score of white oxford shirts with button-down collars. My uniform, I thought, would free me from the daily anxiety of standing in front of my closet wondering, “Does this match?” or “Am I wearing this sweater too often?”At first, I had just swapped one anxiety for another: Would people think I was lazy or boring for wearing a uniform? But as I eased into my new uniform lifestyle, I started to feel better at work because I knew I would look good and I would be dressed perfectly for almost any occasion. Simply put, the decision to go all uniform all the time is one of the best I’ve ever made. I had joined the ranks of very successful people who dress the same every day — Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Barack Obama — and I appreciated that I could so easily communicate who I am.“The whole idea of uniformity and adopting a uniform for yourself, it keeps things very simple,” said the fashion designer Thom Browne, who wears one of his signature “shrunken” gray suits every day.“I think there’s something refreshing when you see someone who has a true sense of their own style,” Mr. Browne said, joking that his uniform is so consistent he could probably get dressed in the dark.“There is a real confidence in being able to project that image,’’ he added. “I hope that’s what people see as well.”Research supports that correlation between self-confidence and the way we present ourselves. In one study from 2012, people were given a coat and told it was either a doctor’s coat or an artist’s smock. Researchers found that the subjects paid more attention to certain tasks when they thought they were wearing a doctor’s coat, but that there was no improvement in performance when they thought it was an artist’s smock.Dr. Adam Galinsky, who ran the study and is a psychologist and professor at Columbia Business School, calls this “enclothed cognition.” When we wear certain clothes, particularly uniforms, we take on the characteristics associated with those uniforms.“The clothes or uniforms that we wear affect our basic processes,” Dr. Galinksy said.For this to work, a person has to understand the symbolism associated with a given outfit. So, if a person begins to conflate their work uniform with a certain persona, they will start to embody that person. It’s kind of like Dumbo’s magic feather, but hopefully covering a lot more skin.Dr. Galinsky added that when a person starts to embody that persona in the office, co-workers will recognize it, reinforcing that persona in the wearer’s mind. This creates an endless feedback loop between how a person wants to be perceived and how they are perceived.Basically, this is the psychological justification for the “dress for the job you want, not the job you have” speech your mother gave you when she bought you your first interview suit after you graduated from college.So what should shoppers do when looking to start a uniform?“The key question you’re asking is, What behavior do we want to produce and what impression do we want to portray?” Dr. Galinksy said. “You work backward from that into that uniform.”Dawnn Karen, a fashion psychologist who teaches at the Fashion Institute of Technology, added that people should look to dress appropriately for their specific office.“You don’t want to be in a tutu when everyone else is wearing a suit,” she said, adding that it goes both ways. For those at a tech firm, a few pairs of the same jeans and two dozen of the most comfortable T-shirts and hoodies are going to get you a lot further than a closet full of stuffy suits.Rather than creating a uniform, Lauren A. Rothman, a stylist who lives in Washington, and wrote the book “Style Bible: What to Wear to Work,” practices “capsule dressing” with her clients, which is curating a small set of clothing that can be mixed or matched together. She suggests four capsules, one for each season. She added that people generally wore only about 25 percent of what was in their closets, so start by finding that 25 percent and replicating it.“The problem with variety is that it is unpredictable and can be unsuccessful,” Ms. Rothman said. “A uniform does communicate who you are. It is great if you have consistent messaging every day about who you are, and what you wear will show that.”When you are buying a uniform, take comfort into account, but also body type, physique and what will make you look and feel good, Ms. Rothman said. And while budget is always a consideration, it does not mean a solid collection can’t be found inexpensively.“A great capsule can be created at Kohl’s and Bonobos as it can at Neimans or Nordstorm,” Ms. Rothman said.Mr. Browne suggests people stick with high-quality goods, things that will last a long time through repeated wearing, and to consider tailoring when possible.And don’t forget you can still customize the details. Dawnn Karen got a client out of her all-black clothing rut by incorporating more jewelry into the client’s everyday attire. For men, consider a rotation of lapel pins, colorful socks and shiny shoes to mix things up.One admittedly clichéd sentiment worth remembering: Less is more. That is certainly a philosophy that Donald Duck, my uniform bête-noire, subscribes to as well.After all, he never even bothered to buy pants."
Movers: Apple’s Developers Conference,"We’re following major market developments throughout the day.• As Apple prepares to show off new features for the iPhone and other devices at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, the company is grappling with an uncomfortable issue: Many of its existing features are already too complicated for many users to figure out.• Don’t forget to read the DealBook Morning Agenda.The French bank Société Générale said on Monday that it planned an initial public offering of ALD, its auto leasing and fleet management arm.Including a potential overallotment of shares, the offering could raise as much as 1.62 billion euros, or $1.82 billion. Société Générale expects to price the offering at €14.20 to €17.40 a share.The listing would allow ALD to gain greater visibility and better capacity to pursue growth opportunities in the corporate and business-to-consumer markets, the bank said.Société Générale would seek to sell up to 23 percent of the business in an offering on Euronext in Paris and would remain the controlling shareholder of the business following the listing.ALD is expected to begin trading in Paris on June 16.Shares of Société Générale declined about 1 percent in early trading in Paris on Monday. — CHAD BRAY"
HomePod Speaker and New iMacs: What We Saw at Apple’s WWDC,"• Apple gave a sneak peek of HomePod, a speaker, to rival Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home. It’s the first brand-new hardware product for Apple since the Apple Watch.• The company also showed new iPads at its annual developer conference, which typically focuses on software instead of hardware.• Also unveiled: a new iMac Pro, upgraded iMacs and MacBooks, and updates to its operating systems.Amazon, with the Echo, pioneered a device that lets you play music, look up basic information and control your lighting and other home accessories. Now Apple’s answer to the Echo — the HomePod — is here, kind of. Apple showed off HomePod on Monday, and it will be available in December.Apple had long been rumored to be working on a device meant to take on the Echo, which has become a surprise hit since Amazon released it nearly three years ago. The category is getting pretty crowded: Last year, Google released a talking home computer of its own, called Google Home, and Microsoft’s assistant, Cortana, is also making its way to home speakers.So how will Apple compete? In a very Apple-like manner: The speaker, powered by the Siri voice assistant, looks spiffier than either Amazon’s or Google’s version — it is a seven-inch-tall canister wrapped in a shiny mesh speaker. The company also said it had prioritized the speaker’s sound, which can be lackluster on rival devices. HomePod has an array of speakers to create virtual surround sound.“You don’t have to know what any of that is; just know that it sounds incredible,” said Phil Schiller, Apple’s marketing chief, who added that HomePod would be priced at $349.Although Apple appears to be trying to make up ground on Amazon and Google, the primary casualty may be Sonos. That company offers a wireless multispeaker system that allows users to listen to music throughout the home, similar to HomePod’s ability to chain together speakers.The big question, though, is whether the intelligence inside Apple’s speaker is good for anything beyond music. Apple was early to the voice game with Siri on the iPhone, but rivals have since lapped it — their voice-command devices are faster, they know more, and they are less annoying to use. Apple promises the new Siri is better, but the improvements it showed were only minor.(With the announcement of HomePod, Apple seems to be finally embracing the technologies it has long put on the back burner. Read more from Farhad Manjoo in his State of the Art column.)Apple’s developer conference typically showcases software improvements. In a departure from that routine, Apple showed a lot of new hardware this time.That included updated versions of the iPad, which has been declining in sales. Apple showed that it was continuing to bet on the tablets by unveiling an iPad upgrade that the company’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said was pushing the device “further than it ever has before.”The new version of the iPad Pro has a 10.5-inch display, 20 percent larger than the previous 9.7-inch model, and it will start at $649. Apple said the size made it perfect for displaying a virtual keyboard comparable to a full-size physical keyboard. The company also highlighted a feature called ProMotion that increases the refresh rate and makes motion smoother in video content.After Steve Jobs introduced the original iPad in 2010, tablets exploded in popularity, but iPad sales have slumped for more than a year now. So Apple, under increasing pressure from investors to strengthen its revenue, has upgraded iPads more frequently than many of its other products. The company introduced a cheaper version of the 9.7-inch iPad, priced at $329, in March and a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, compatible with an Apple stylus and keyboard, in 2015.Some of Apple’s rivals have capitalized on the iPad’s stumbles. Amazon said recently that its tablet sales had grown substantially compared with last year. Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablets are extremely cheap, starting at $50, and they allow for basic functions like reading e-books, streaming Netflix and listening to music.Apple’s predicament seems to be that for existing iPad customers, their tablets are still quite capable and running strong, giving them little reason to upgrade. For new customers, the iPad may be overkill for basic tasks, especially if you can just pay $50 for a media tablet from Amazon.One of Apple’s splashiest hardware debuts was a brand new iMac Pro that will support up to 18 core processors and include a graphic chipset called Radeon Vega. Translation: It is Apple’s all-in-one desktop on steroids.“It’s going to be the most powerful Mac we’ve ever made,” said John Ternus, Apple’s vice president for hardware engineering.The new iMac Pro may help compensate for Apple’s previous professional desktop, the Mac Pro, which was widely panned by critics and customers. The iMac Pro will start at $5,000 and ship in December.With this device, Apple is broadly catering to members of the professional community, like filmmakers and hard-core coders. For years, these users have felt left behind as Apple has focused on consumer-oriented products like the iPhone, shifting away from high-performance equipment for professionals.The company also announced upgrades of its 27-inch and 21.5-inch iMacs, its desktop computers, which will start at $1,099, with additional models at $1,299 and $1,799. And Apple lowered some prices for its MacBooks and said the MacBook Air, its entry-level lightweight laptop, would get a speed increase. The 21.5-inch model with 4K high resolution will start at about $1,300, with a new 13-inch MacBook Pro starting at $1,300.Last year was rough for the Mac. Fans of the MacBook Pro waited for Apple to unveil a major upgrade after the laptop had remained relatively unchanged for about four years. But when Apple introduced a new MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar, a virtual touch strip embedded into its keyboard, customers were divided. Some fans concluded that the Mac was now in the back seat because Apple was prioritizing the iPhone, the iPad and the Apple Watch.Every year, Apple updates the underlying operating systems that power its devices. The changes are geeky — remember, they are aimed at software developers — but they eventually trickle down to how we use iPhones, Macs and Apple Watches.The most important update was to iOS, the operating system that underpins Apple’s biggest seller, iPhones, as well as iPads. Apple introduced iOS 11, with improved camera software; upgrades for Siri; an expansion of its mobile payment system, Apple Pay; and a new version of Apple Maps, with indoor mapping and features to prevent distracted driving.Because the show is about giving new tools to developers, Apple also focused on emerging technologies. Specifically, Apple highlighted augmented reality, a way for people to view and digitally manipulate the physical world around them through the lens of their smartphone cameras.The iPhone already supports augmented reality with games like Pokémon Go. On Monday, Apple said it was offering a new tool kit for bringing advanced augmented reality applications to the iPhone and the iPad. Mr. Cook has spoken several times of Apple‘s interest in augmented reality, hinting that the company could be developing an augmented reality headset.Apple demonstrated changes to the operating system for the Apple Watch including a new watch face that uses Siri to suggest directions, show calendar items and generally predict what you will want to see. The most substantive changes focused on fitness, including the ability to track new types of high-intensity workouts.Apple also unveiled a new operating system for its Mac computers, called High Sierra. The company made privacy a key selling point with this and said the next version of its Safari web browser would block videos that automatically start playing and stop advertising trackers. While users will probably welcome those changes, the development was another blow to web publishers, who rely on ads that Apple will now block. Apple added optional ad blocking to the iPhone and the iPad last year."
Ask the Sketch Guy: Should I Finally Buy Some Bitcoin?,"Last week, I announced the beginning of a semiregular “Ask the Sketch Guy” service. Send me your questions, but not just any questions. I want to explore the deep, dark conversations that we don’t hear on the financial pornography network, like how we feel about money and how money makes us feel.To kick off things, Shawn Cook from San Diego asked a question about Bitcoin. (For an explainer on Bitcoin, see this article by Nathaniel Popper of The New York Times, who literally wrote the book on the topic.) His hipster friend is constantly bugging him to invest in the cryptocurrency. It’s making Shawn wonder: Should he ditch his boring old index fund?Shawn, this is a great question because who among us doesn’t have a hipster friend who is always talking about how he is killing it with his investments in Bitcoin, Apple and Tesla? Those people have all the fun! They seem to know exactly what’s going to happen in whatever market they’re investing in and have this aura of self-assurance that is really annoying. It’s enough to cause even the most rational, non-hip among us to doubt our boring, old-style investing.In fact, I remember feeling a bit this way back in 1999. I was surrounded by tech people with their BlackBerries and Hotmail accounts. I resisted the siren call of the Nasdaq and the technology bubble — until I finally gave in. Then, I took some hard-earned money out of a boring diversified investment and bought Infospace.Remember that? If you do, it may not be pleasant. In fact, I can’t remember the exact details because they’re too painful, but I know I invested a lot of money (for me) back then. When I sold, I didn’t have enough to pay for a burrito and a Coke. I even considered buying more on “the dip.” Except I didn’t have any more money to invest, and this wasn’t a dip. The stock never recovered to anything close to what I had paid to buy it. Today, I still have the stock certificate as a reminder of that valuable lesson.So, Shawn, the moral of the story is that your friend just might be right. But then again, he might be flat-out wrong.What he is talking about is speculation at best, and it’s probably closer to gambling. If you have some spare money and you feel like gambling, fire away.But here’s an alternative idea. Keep your low-cost, boring, diversified investments, and have a T-shirt made (black, with white text) that says: “I own Bitcoin. How you like me now?” I’ll even provide the sketch.Keep the questions coming via your voice messages!"
Challenges to Insider Trading Convictions Take Aim at Evidence,"We are used to watching television programs about cases being solved by DNA evidence, a fingerprint or even a timely confession.White-collar crime is often quite different, resembling more a thousand-piece puzzle than a whodunit as prosecutors try to put together tidbits of information that can add up to a conviction.Still, a single piece of evidence can play a crucial role in the outcome by rounding out a picture of the defendant’s knowledge of the wrongdoing, a crucial factor in a trial. Two challenges to insider trading convictions highlight how important that evidence can be as the defendants seek to pull out a single thread to unravel an entire prosecution.Sean Stewart, a former investment banker at JPMorgan Chase and Perella Weinberg, was convicted last year of tipping his father, Robert, about five health care deals. The father made about $150,000 from the trading and shared the information with a friend who made nearly $1 million. The court sentenced Sean Stewart to a three-year prison term.In a brief filed last week appealing the conviction, Mr. Stewart challenges a crucial piece of evidence that prosecutors said showed that he knew his father was trading on the information about the deals. In a recorded conversation, Robert Stewart told his friend who had traded on the information and was cooperating with the government by then that Sean Stewart once said: “I can’t believe it. I handed you this on a silver platter and you didn’t invest.”The “silver platter” comment was a linchpin to the government’s case because it gave the jurors a basis to find Mr. Stewart’s intent to tip inside information rather than just innocently talking to his father about work.An out-of-court statement like that would normally be inadmissible hearsay unless Robert Stewart had testified about making the statement. But the trial judge admitted the recording under an exception to the hearsay rule that allows a “statement against interest” to come before the jury, finding that the father essentially implicated himself in an insider-trading scheme with his comment. If someone is willing to rat himself out, then that is considered sufficiently trustworthy to be admitted.Here is where the legal analysis gets tricky, because the judge would not allow other hearsay statements by Robert Stewart in which he denied his son knew that he was using the confidential deal information for trading. Moreover, Mr. Stewart tried to call his father to testify at trial, but Robert Stewart asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused to do so. When the government refused to grant him immunity, there was little Mr. Stewart could do to counter the impact of the recording.Mr. Stewart’s brief argues that most of the government’s proof of his intent came from the “silver platter” recording. He claims that admitting this evidence while cutting off other avenues to challenge his father’s statement violated his right to offer a defense, and should result in a new trial.The advantage of this approach is that the focus is on the judge’s legal rationale for admitting the evidence, not on how the jury should have assessed the credibility of a witness or the weight to be given to certain evidence. Those types of decisions are largely immune from appellate review because courts are hesitant to second-guess a jury’s view of the case.The jury took five days to decide Mr. Stewart’s guilt, a sign that this was a close decision. He has essentially put all of his eggs in the single basket of whether the admission of his father’s statement was an error — that is, without it, it is questionable whether the jury would have voted to convict.The second case involves a motion for a new trial filed by William T. Walters, a renowned gambler convicted of trading on information he had received from Thomas C. Davis, a former chairman of the board of Dean Foods who also worked as a consultant in an activist campaign involving Darden Restaurants.The crux of the argument is that Mr. Davis committed perjury in his testimony about when he got a prepaid cellular telephone from Mr. Walters, which was nicknamed the “Bat Phone” and used to communicate the confidential information about Dean Foods and Darden.Mr. Davis testified he had received the phone in 2011, giving a detailed description of meeting Mr. Walters when he flew into a Dallas airport and then using it over the next two years. But records show the only time Mr. Walters’s private plane was in Dallas was in December 2012.Mr. Walters claims that the government was aware that Mr. Davis had lied on the witness stand about the meeting and delivery of the phone but did nothing to correct it. The defense argues that prosecutors exacerbated the violation of his rights by relying on the testimony in arguing that the jury should return a guilty verdict.The challenge for Mr. Walters is that, unlike Mr. Stewart, the testimony about the Bat Phone was not the key to the government’s case, although it gave a clear flavor to their relationship. Mr. Davis testified about a number of disclosures of confidential information over a long period, and that Mr. Walters also used his own disposable cellphone for communications.Just as important, the claim that Mr. Davis was lying was a featured part of the cross-examination by Mr. Walters’s lawyer, and the government readily admitted to his many flaws. In the closing statement, a prosecutor said: “Tom Davis is morally corrupt. He’s a womanizer, a bad husband, and he stole money from a charity he ran” — hardly a ringing endorsement of its own witness.Whether Mr. Davis committed perjury or just had a faulty memory will be difficult to determine and ultimately may not be of great significance. A major hurdle for winning a new trial is determining whether any flaw was only a harmless error, a rule that allows the court to write off a problem as an inconsequential mistake while upholding the verdict.In a case in which the government puts forth a number of pieces of circumstantial evidence to show insider trading, the veracity of one witness — even a crucial one — on one topic over the four days that Mr. Davis testified might not be enough to upset the conviction.Judges are reluctant to overturn a jury verdict, especially in a white-collar crime prosecution in which the proof often depends on jurors weighing competing evidence and drawing inferences from otherwise ordinary transactions. Getting a new trial to give the defense a second bite at the apple is a substantial challenge, but even then there is no guarantee that the case will come out differently.The recent prosecution of Jesse C. Litvak, a former mortgage-backed securities trader, for lying to customers about the prices paid for bonds shows that even a second trial might not change anything. After being convicted in 2014 and seeing the case overturned because of a legal error by the trial judge, he was retried in 2016 and once again found guilty, receiving the same two-year prison term as before.It is always worth challenging a conviction, but there is no guarantee of a positive result even when a defendant wins a new trial."
Western Nations Worry That Children Won’t Be Better Off,"The present is getting better. The future, not at all.Even as more Americans say the economy is improving, a clear majority remain fearful about their children’s financial prospects, according to a study released Monday.The pessimism is not limited to the United States, either, according to the report, which was produced by the Pew Research Center. In France, more than 70 percent of respondents said they doubted that their children would be better off financially, with a similarly bleak outlook reported in Britain, Spain, Italy and Germany.“Even in advanced economies where people think they are doing well, like Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, they are worried about their kids’ financial prospects,” said Bruce Stokes, director of global economic attitudes at Pew. “Clearly, even though unemployment is falling and growth is returning after the financial crisis, this pessimism raises questions about whether this is a temporary phenomenon.”The Pew Research Center, a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank, surveyed people in 32 countries this year and found that overall sentiment about the current economic situation had rebounded sharply from postrecession lows. But the views varied widely across borders.While 86 percent of Germans feel good about current economic conditions, the most in the eurozone, only 21 percent in neighboring France feel similarly sanguine. Still, even in Germany, only 36 percent think their children will be better off; the figure in France is 9 percent.In Britain, where voters shocked political leaders at home and abroad last June by voting to exit the European Union, 51 percent approve of the state of the economy, a figure nearly unchanged from 2015, while 24 percent think the next generation would do better.In the United States, the outlook has improved steadily in recent years, with 58 percent terming the situation good, up from 40 percent in 2015. Despite that, only 37 percent of Americans believe their children will be better off financially.After decades of struggling to recover from the collapse of the Soviet Union, more than half of Russians expect things to be better for the next generation. Faster-growing countries like India, the Philippines, Nigeria and Ghana, which have undergone an economic transformation in recent decades, also show high levels of optimism.The survey was conducted through telephone or face-to-face interviews in each country.“We in the West have always thought the future would be better, and we invested in it and saved for it,” Mr. Stokes said. “But this hasn’t been the case in recent years.”In the United States, the gloom about what lies ahead for the economy is evident on both sides of the aisle. Among Republicans, 50 percent are doubtful about future economic prospects; 62 percent of Democrats are in the pessimistic camp.At roughly 2 percent, the American economy’s growth rate in recent years has been tepid by the standards of past recoveries, disappointing both policy makers and consumers looking to regain ground lost during the recession from late 2007 to mid-2009.But steady hiring, a recovering housing market and soaring stock prices have helped lift spirits, even with the anemic annual growth.Last week, the government reported that the unemployment rate in May fell to 4.3 percent, which was the lowest rate in 16 years and was down more than a full percentage point from two years ago. But Americans with a college degree or more education, along with those in high-income households, have received the vast majority of the resulting financial gains.Pew’s data tracked that divergence, with 69 percent of Americans with a bachelor’s degree satisfied with the economy’s condition, compared with 55 percent of workers with just a high school diploma.Given that only one-third of Americans are college graduates, it is likely this split will persist, or even worsen.“These people are experiencing a different economy,” Mr. Stokes said. “Everything we know from the economic statistics shows there is an income premium if you have a college education. It’s another reminder that we live in a very divided society, not just politically but economically.”"
"Led by Rachel Maddow, MSNBC Surges to Unfamiliar Spot: No. 1 in Prime Time","The last time that MSNBC was No. 1 in prime-time cable news, Bill Clinton was president, Madonna led the Billboard charts and “Friends” still ran new episodes on TV.Seventeen years and a few rebrandings later, the network is back on top — buoyed by a surge of interest in news and the channel’s stable of reliably liberal anchors, like Rachel Maddow, who have found their groove amid a time of intense anxiety for the political left.The MSNBC resurgence — in May, it beat its rivals for the highest prime-time viewership on weeknights in the critical 25-to-54 age demographic, up an astounding 118 percent from a year earlier — is part of a newly shifting landscape in television news, and within the channel itself.When Andrew Lack became chairman of NBC News in 2015, he announced his intent to shift MSNBC away from Keith Olbermann-style bloviation and toward nonpartisan, straight-ahead news gathering.Mr. Olbermann may be long gone. Yet the network’s rise has relied largely on its sharply opinionated commentary, with Ms. Maddow moving to No. 1 in prime time on the strength of monologues devoted to President Trump’s ties to Russia, and with Lawrence O’Donnell speaking openly about impeachment.In an interview, Mr. Lack rejected the notion that MSNBC was a Fox News for the left.“I don’t buy it,” he said, his voice rising. “And honestly, I’ve never been comfortable with the Fox examples, of how we compare to them, or being an alternative to them. I don’t think we’re an alternative to anything. We’re live, breaking news during the day, and the smartest, most insightful opinion space we can create at night.”The network’s marketing campaigns have promoted its reporting heft, with experienced journalists like Andrea Mitchell and Chuck Todd taking over daytime hosting duties from the likes of Al Sharpton. Mr. Lack, 70, who helped found MSNBC in 1996, said the investment in straight-news reporting had allowed the channel to compete during last year’s presidential race and led viewers to feel more comfortable turning to MSNBC during breaking news.Without that journalism, he added, “I don’t think you have the success that you’re seeing.”MSNBC’s morning and afternoon audience is growing fast: Its total viewership between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. nearly doubled in May from the year before, far outstripping the growth at CNN and Fox News.Over all, though, the network is still No. 3 in daytime. Its landmark ratings win in May came squarely in the liberal precincts of prime time, and there are signs the network is doubling down in that arena.Phil Griffin, the executive who cultivated Ms. Maddow and her 8 p.m. lead-in, Chris Hayes, recently agreed to a new long-term deal. Mr. O’Donnell, who announced to viewers last month that MSNBC was dragging its feet on renewing his contract, has secured his 10 p.m. slot.MSNBC may be benefiting from the same “resistance” effect that cemented Fox News in the top spot at the onset of Barack Obama’s presidency, when the channel was lifted by a wave of conservative discontent.“There is no question that progressives, liberals on the left side of the political spectrum, have in MSNBC the home they’ve known,” Mr. Lack said in a phone interview. “The work that’s being done is outstanding there in my view, and they’re being rewarded for it.”Unsurprisingly, MSNBC’s rivals are less than impressed.A CNN spokeswoman, Barbara Levin, referred to CNN as “the one nonpartisan cable news network” and noted the anchors Jake Tapper and Anderson Cooper had beaten MSNBC in their time slots last month in the crucial demographic.“These highly partisan times have clearly been good news for MSNBC’s opinion programming,” Ms. Levin wrote.Fox News executives pointed out that their network won in weekday prime-time viewers over all — a less crucial statistic for advertisers, but a testament to the network’s continued influence. Fox was also No. 1 in May when weekends and all parts of the 24-hour broadcast day were measured.For MSNBC, the old stereotypes persist. At this year’s White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, the comedian Hasan Minhaj took aim at MSNBC as “the liberal news outlet.”“I want to root for you guys, but you’re turning into conspiracy theorists every night,” Mr. Minhaj joked. “Just pump the brakes. By the end of the year, you’re all going to have tinfoil hats and jars of urine all over your desks.”Asked about the network’s copious Russia coverage, Mr. Lack said he had no qualms, saying of the story, “It’s got a lot of tentacles.”In recent weeks, Mr. Lack has risked backlash from some liberals by hiring conservative commentators Hugh Hewitt and George Will, and assigning an afternoon talk show to Nicolle Wallace, a former senior aide to President George W. Bush.“They bring background, they bring sources, they bring reporting,” Mr. Lack said. “The strategy is built around smart.”That approach prompted Janelle Rodriguez, who oversees daytime programming at MSNBC, to lean more on the reporting assets of the network’s broadcast cousin, NBC News, and restrict the size of on-air panels. The idea, she said, is to avoid “the empty calories of cable news wrestling matches.”Not every shift has been an instant success. Greta Van Susteren, hired after she left Fox News, has been ranked third at 6 p.m.“It’s not breaking out,” Mr. Lack said of her show. “Everybody wants every new show to break out Day 1. I think it takes time, and I’ve got a lot of patience.”One move that did work: the surprising resurrection of Brian Williams.Hatched by Mr. Lack and him over an Italian dinner, Mr. Williams’s “11th Hour” — a mix of news and analysis — was pitched as a temporary comeback vehicle for Mr. Williams, who had been tarnished by a fabulism scandal at NBC News shortly before Mr. Lack arrived. In May, the show brought MSNBC its first outright win in the 11 p.m. time slot since 2001.So is Mr. Williams headed to prime time? Mr. Lack ducked. “He is in prime time,” he said, suggesting that his definition stretched beyond the industry standard of 8 to 11 p.m. “Frankly, I think it’s an old barrier.”Cable news is a fickle business, and MSNBC is surging when its main rival is hobbled. Fox News’s prime-time ratings dipped last month amid a management shake-up and Bill O’Reilly’s exit; privately, Fox employees admit the network is in retooling mode.Still, last week, Fox News went to No. 1 again in weekday prime time — although Ms. Maddow was out sick."
Apple Needs to Reinvent Itself. It Just Might Be Doing So.,"SAN JOSE, Calif. — One of Apple’s greatest strengths is timing. The company that’s hailed for innovation does not often invent things first — it didn’t create the first personal computer, the first digital music player or the first smartphone. Instead, Apple reinvents, slipping in and producing something more original than what we used to use.On paper, Apple is aiming to pull the same trick with a device called HomePod. The $349 gadget — which Apple unveiled on Monday at its annual developer conference and will begin shipping in December — is inspired by the Amazon Echo, the smart speaker that houses Amazon’s virtual assistant, Alexa, and that seemed like a joke until many people (including yours truly) suddenly began to love it.Apple’s version ticks all the Apple-y boxes: It’s very pretty; it’s about twice the price of the Echo; and it has much better sound, including the ability to create a kind of surround sound customized to your room.Yet the reinvention that matters here isn’t about a single device — it’s larger: The success of HomePod will really depend on whether Apple can reinvent itself.For some time now, Apple has faced questions about its growth and what rabbits it can pull out of its hat next, especially as rivals including Google, Facebook and Amazon appear to have gotten the jump on it with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, virtual reality and augmented reality. The Apple iPhone remains the most profitable computing device in the world, and Apple’s immediate future looks sunny, but its long-term outlook has begun to look partly cloudy. In a world that seems to care less and less about beautiful hardware and more about services that help you from afar, over the air, without your ever having to touch a machine, Apple risks becoming an anachronism.HomePod will be a test of how Apple responds to these difficulties. That’s because for Apple to outdo Amazon in the home assistant game, it will need to prioritize skills that have long been on its back burner — cloud services and A.I., for instance.But here’s the surprising thing: Apple seems to be up for such reinvention. If you read between the lines at its keynote address on Monday, you would have noticed something. Again and again, like shamans calling on some new and powerful magic, Apple executives invoked the buzzwords of modern computing: “machine learning,” “deep learning” and “computer vision.”Subtly but unmistakably, they were suggesting a shift. Apple seems to be transforming itself into a new kind of company, one that prioritizes the nerdy technical stuff that will become the foundation of tomorrow’s intelligent machines — whereas in the past, the company tended to hide this stuff, even if it recognized its importance.This shift doesn’t mean that HomePod will succeed, or that Amazon’s device is in trouble; with a head start, much cheaper devices and lots of irrepressible fans, the Echo has momentum that will be difficult to curb. Plus, nobody knows yet how well HomePod will work.In broad strokes, the device seems to do much of what its rivals can. Say, “Hey Siri, play me some Carly Rae Jepsen,” and it will belt out perfect Canadian pop. It will also answer questions about the music it’s playing, and, just like the Echo, it can perform a wide variety of other functions — setting timers, telling you the weather and controlling your smart lights and other home devices.HomePod also lacks a lot that the Echo has perfected. For now, it seems bound to Apple’s ecosystem. Apple said that it connects to its own subscription music service, but declined to specify whether it would let you play songs from Spotify or other services, or whether there was a way for third-party developers to create additional voice-activated functions, which is one of the best features of the Echo. Alexa can order an Uber for you; HomePod may ask you to try using your phone. And obviously, HomePod lacks the Echo’s deep integration with Amazon’s online store, which, to many users, is a killer feature: Running out of dish soap? Alexa will order it for you, but Siri can’t.Yet many of these are omissions that you’d expect in a new device, and Apple will most likely add improvements in updates. What will matter most, at first, is how reliably HomePod can perform the basics.If you’re a longtime Siri user, your skepticism is warranted. The best thing about Amazon’s speaker is its reliability: Say something from far away, even in a noisy room, and most of the time it will at least recognize what you asked it. Once you get an idea of the kinds of requests it can handle, Alexa begins to seem like a completely natural interface to computers. It responds so quickly that it starts to seem like a helpful member of the family rather than a computer in a can.Can Siri in HomePod do that? I can’t tell you yet for certain. I got a chance to listen to HomePod — but not use any of its voice-activated features — after Apple’s keynote. As the company promised, it does sound much deeper and richer than a Sonos Play 3 or an Amazon Echo, closer to what you might hear in a high-end home stereo system. But the true test for such a device is how it works in real-world conditions, handling the multiplicity of requests that you might think up during a day — and for now, we have no idea how that might work.Yet I am cautiously optimistic, mainly on the basis of the many other computationally difficult features that Apple showed off on Monday. Many of them are versions of features that rivals like Google have spent years perfecting.For example, Siri will now translate languages for you. Like a true assistant, Siri is also now more predictive — it aims to spot common computing problems and offer to help. (If it notices that you’ve been chatting about a coming appointment, for instance, it will offer to add it to your calendar.)Best of all, Siri is finally a single unified personality that sits across all of your devices. In the past, Siri on your iPad was different from Siri on your Mac — one would learn that you’re traveling to Iceland, and the other might never know. Now, similar to other assistants, Siri knows you and can anticipate your interests on whatever device you use.There was more, too. Apple is letting developers create apps that can perform machine learning tasks on its devices. It’s also diving heavily into computer vision. Developers can now create augmented reality features, meaning they can add virtual objects overlaid on images from the real world.If you follow the tech industry you know these are all hot topics that other companies are investing in heavily. Apple is still a laggard, and I wouldn’t expect it to beat Google in an A.I. contest anytime soon.But it doesn’t need to. All Apple has to do is stay competitive — it’s got to invest just enough in the A.I.-driven future to keep its devices compelling. There’s no mistake, now, that it’s doing so."
Morning Agenda: Mickey Drexler to Resign as J. Crew C.E.O.,"It’s the end of an era in the world of fashion: Millard Drexler is stepping down as J. Crew’s chief executive.The move by Mr. Drexler, known as Mickey, is the second major executive change at J. Crew in recent months — Jenna Lyons, the American retailer’s longtime executive creative director, resigned in April.Mr. Drexler will remain J. Crew’s chairman and will retain his significant equity stake in the retailer, but his resignation is an acknowledgment that the brand needed to go in a new direction, especially with the retail industry struggling.Succeeding Mr. Drexler at J. Crew, which is backed by the private equity firms TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners, will be James Brett, president of the home furnishing brand West Elm. Mr. Brett will take over in July.When President Trump appointed Marc E. Kasowitz as his private attorney to represent him in investigations into associates’ ties to Russia, Beltway insiders scrambled to learn more about the lawyer, a newcomer to politics.Mr. Kasowitz is well known, though, in Wall Street and Manhattan business circles.In his DealBook column, Andrew Ross Sorkin describes Mr. Kasowitz as “the Donald Trump of lawyering,” minus the tweets.For example, the first paragraph of Mr. Kasowitz’s biography on his firm’s website highlights the dozens of media outlets that have written about him, and how they have described him as the “toughest lawyer on Wall Street,” an “uberlitigator” and “the toughest of the tough guys.”“In case you didn’t get the message, he likes a good fight, the nastier the better,” Mr. Sorkin writes.Kushner Companies, which is owned by the family of Jared Kushner, son-in-law and senior adviser to Mr. Trump, is looking for $250 million to repay the backers of a Jersey City apartment tower that was financed by Chinese investors.Kushner Companies spent about $225 million to build the luxury building, called Trump Bay Street, in which Mr. Kushner maintains a stake.It financed the project with about $190 million in loans, including $50 million through the so-called EB-5 visa program, which gives foreign investors preferential treatment in obtaining permanent residency if they invest at least $500,000 in American development projects.Kushner Companies must repay a $140 million construction loan from CIT Group, which is due in September.It also wants to pay off its EB-5 loans, which are all from Chinese investors, even though the loans are not due for several years.Kushner Companies’ refinancing plans were reported earlier by Bloomberg News.• Results of a fight between General Motors and Greenlight Capital will be announced at the automaker’s annual shareholder meeting in Detroit."
Movers: G.M. Shareholders Reject Einhorn,"We’re following major market developments throughout the day.Shareholders of General Motors on Tuesday rejected proposals by a dissident investor to replace three company directors and split the automaker’s stock into two classes.The proposals, by the hedge fund Greenlight Capital, which owns a 3.6 percent stake in G.M., were aimed at bolstering the sagging value of the automaker’s stock.G.M. said Greenlight’s dual-stock proposal was defeated with more than 91 percent of the votes cast against it. Greenlight’s president, David Einhorn, did not attend the meeting.Delivery Hero, a German online-ordering company, said on Tuesday that it planned a listing in the coming months on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.The company, which was founded in Berlin in 2011, said that it planned to raise 450 million euros, or about $507 million, in its offering of new shares.“Going public and listing our shares on the stock market will further enable us to develop the company and provide us with additional capital to expand our leadership positions in the online food ordering and delivery market,” Niklas Östberg, the Delivery Hero chief executive, said in a news release.Delivery Hero has more than 6,000 employees and provides delivery services in more than 40 countries.About 35 percent of the company is indirectly held by Rocket Internet, the German technology company, and about 10 percent is held by Naspers, the South African internet company and technology investor.Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting as joint global coordinators on the offering."
U.S. Presses China to Free Activists Scrutinizing Ivanka Trump Shoe Factory,"SHANGHAI — China faces growing pressure to release three labor activists detained for investigating conditions at factories that make Ivanka Trump’s shoe brand, as experts warned that the detentions could make it more difficult for other Western companies to take a clear look at the practices of their Chinese suppliers.Chinese officials on Tuesday dismissed a call from the United States to release the activists and grant them judicial protections and a fair trial. At a daily news briefing, Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said it was an internal Chinese matter.On Monday, Alicia Edwards, a deputy State Department spokeswoman, said that such labor activists can help American companies find abuses in the factories that make their products or parts. For companies, she said, finding those abuses “can be essential in fulfilling their own responsibilities and holding Chinese manufacturers accountable under Chinese labor laws.”That statement echoed the views of experts on how foreign businesses use China’s vast numbers of factories to make their products. While activists in general are commonly detained in China, labor experts say that this represents the first time that China has held undercover labor activists looking at the supply chains of Western companies. Their continued detention, they said, could erode the confidence of companies that they can find out what is really happening among their suppliers.“To the extent that a brand will only purchase items that it is confident were produced free of labor abuse, limitations on independent monitors present a serious obstacle to doing business in a jurisdiction,” said Aaron Halegua, a research fellow at New York University’s Center for Labor and Employment Law,It is not clear why the three labor activists, who were working for an activist group called China Labor Watch, were detained while others were not, or whether the connection to President Trump’s daughter played a role. Still, Ms. Trump’s involvement complicates what might otherwise have been a more-or-less routine call from the United States for China to improve its human rights practices.For the activists, it could also offer a potential way out. If Ms. Trump called for their release, said Jerome Cohen, the faculty director of New York University’s U.S.-Asia Law Institute, they could quickly win their freedom or better treatment.“There is no doubt that a statement by the Ivanka Trump organization, expressing deep concern over the detention of labor activists striving to improve working conditions, would be helpful to their situation,” said Mr. Cohen, an influential academic since the 1960s on China’s legal system. “It alone might bring about their release.”The Ivanka Trump brand has declined to comment on the case. Marc Fisher Footwear, which licenses and distributes the brand, has said that it is looking into the allegations against Huajian International, a Chinese company that makes shoes for a number of brands, including Ms. Trump’s.The three activists who disappeared last month were investigating conditions at factories owned by Huajian. The chairman of Huajian, Zhang Huarong, strongly denied in an interview in December that his company had broken any labor laws, and company spokesmen have reiterated that in recent days.Hours after the statement from the United States, a lawyer for one of the activists was allowed to hold a 90-minute lunchtime meeting with his client at a detention center in Ganzhou in southern China. The lawyer, Wen Yu, said he had previously been turned away twice in attempts to meet his client, Hua Haifeng.Mr. Wen said that his client described being kept in a room crowded with about 20 suspects in various criminal cases. Mr. Hua had to sleep just a foot from a bucket that detainees used to urinate during the night, and the smell and noise made it hard for him to sleep, Mr. Wen said.Mr. Wen said that a second investigator who had also been in Ganzhou, Su Heng, was being detained in a different room at the same center, and had a different lawyer representing him.Mr. Hua’s wife, Deng Guilian, said she had asked a guard at the detention center if a third investigator, Li Zhao, was also being held there and the guard had said yes. But Mr. Wen said he had not heard of any lawyer being named to represent Mr. Li.A spokesman for the Ganzhou police, who gave only his surname, Wu, declined to comment on the men’s cases and referred questions to a municipal propaganda office. Reached by phone, an official there had no immediate response.Mr. Hua is accused of illegal use of eavesdropping or photographic equipment, Mr. Wen said, while the accusations against the other two men have not been officially confirmed. China Labor Watch said the three men were not engaged in illegal activity; Mr. Wen said his client had used a cellphone in the factory to take photos but added that this was legal.Huajian makes 100,000 to 200,000 pairs of Ivanka Trump shoes each year out of annual production of eight million pairs. The company last made a batch of the Ivanka Trump brand in March, and was planning to do another batch at the end of May, before the activists were detained, China Labor Watch said.China Labor Watch said the detentions marked the first time in its 17 years of operation, including hundreds of investigations, that any of its undercover activists had been detained. China has been cautious about enacting legal protections for people who expose labor abuses. The Chinese Communist Party strictly controls labor groups and forbids independent unions.At the same time, Beijing has also been wary of seeming as if it is protecting Western companies and their suppliers against the interests of Chinese workers. As a result, the Chinese government has generally been somewhat more tolerant of labor activity at factories belonging to multinationals, and to some extent at factories in their supply chains, while taking a very strict stance toward any hint of independent labor actions at purely domestic companies.Anita Chan, a political scientist at Australian National University, said some companies might have become numb to warnings about labor violations in their supply changes. Complaints may seem constant, she said, and they might not mind if activists find it harder to get inside a factory.“Things haven’t changed very much,” she said, “and it doesn’t embarrass them.”"
Why Regulators Are Needed to Handle Failed Banks,"One of the major reforms to avoid the recurrence of the severity of the financial crisis was a set of mechanisms by which the regulators could wind down failed banks or restructure them if they were still viable.The House of Representatives is set to vote to repeal this measure and replace it with a bankruptcy that only the bankers themselves could decide to enter. These are dangerous actions that can risk turning a tumultuous bank failure into a deep and full financial crisis, like that of the 2008-9 financial panic. Bankruptcy alone cannot handle a financial crisis emanating from collapsed banks.Adding a robust bankruptcy channel makes much sense. But repealing the regulatory-led system and replacing it with bankruptcy is unwise. Replacing it with the narrow, limited bankruptcy structure moving forward in the House is exceedingly unwise.First off, the House bankruptcy-for-banks bill bars the regulators from initiating the bankruptcy; only bank management can. But bank executives have reason to “gamble for resurrection,” putting off a day of reckoning when they will be out of a job and disgraced, in hopes that the economy or the bank will recover first. That delay could be fatal in a crisis.If the megabank continues to sink, it could take down the economy with it. Lehman Brothers waited too long to file for bankruptcy in 2008 and ran out of cash. Its resulting disorderly bankruptcy seriously damaged the economy.The House bill’s supporters trust the judgment of the failed bank executives over that of the United States to keep the economy steady. They seek to avoid a bailout but put considerable power into the hands of those it fears would be bailed out.Worse, in a broad financial crisis with many megabanks tottering, the government’s response needs to be coordinated and coherent. Bankruptcy judges cannot caucus and come up with a common policy. They cannot provide liquidity to the stumbling bank and neither can other megabanks because they would all be hoarding liquidity in a crisis. Only the government can, and the only formal channel for it to do so is embedded in the regulatory-led restructuring mechanism.For megabanks with global operations, American regulators need to coordinate actions with regulators abroad. Even if the bankruptcy courts can quickly restructure a United States bank’s failed American operations, creditors on the bank’s London subsidiaries might still run, taking down the United States operations no matter what the bankruptcy judge does. Bankruptcy judges cannot coordinate a systemwide response and to develop international understandings. That response needs staff and financial experience, which the regulators have.The House bill aims to restructure the bank over a 48-hour weekend, by closing it on Friday evening, turning the bank complex’s nondeposit debt into stock during the weekend, then reopening the bank on Monday in a stable way without a government bailout. This is the best outcome if it works; but it’s at risk of failing when it’s needed. To succeed, the bankrupt bank complex needs to have enough of the right kind of debt in place — debt that can be eliminated over a weekend to stabilize the bank by Monday morning.Bankruptcy judges cannot assure in advance that enough of that kind of debt is in place. The regulators can, but the House banking committee’s substitution proposal would sharply cut back the regulators’ official means of doing so.Such a 48-hour high-wire giant bankruptcy has never been tried, much less succeeded. But the House bill doesn’t steady the situation with a backup if the bank cannot be stabilized enough to reopen on Monday morning. There is no safety net and a chaotic free-for-all would ensue, like that of the Lehman bankruptcy’s initial days, with financial markets worldwide in disarray, sharply worsening the nascent recession. The economy needs a regulator backup. But the House bill does away with that one we have.There are too many unknowns about bankruptcy for banks, and they will not be resolved until there is crisis. Bankruptcy judges, for example, lack the full judicial power of the United States, so a hedge fund creditor of the bank complex about to be knocked out, who wants to be bought off or bailed out, would challenge the bankruptcy court’s authority.The Monday morning headline — “Megabank Restructured, but Judge’s Constitutional Authority Challenged. Supreme Court to Decide Next Week.” would induce creditors who can cash out to do so on Monday morning, not wait a week. They will run and bring the bank down.Financial stability in a crisis is critical enough to have two viable institutional channels for resolution. Let’s add a robust bankruptcy channel. While we shouldn’t expect a bankruptcy bank restructuring to become as routine as bankruptcy has become for airlines, we can get closer to that limit than we are now. But the House bill, by tying a narrow new bankruptcy channel to repealing the current regulatory one, is taking grave risks that the country may pay for if we are threatened by another financial crisis."

Victory Over Einhorn Provides Little Solace to General Motors,"David Einhorn’s financial engineering effort has hit a dead end at General Motors.His Greenlight Capital’s proposal to increase the automaker’s value by issuing a new class of dividend shares got a drubbing from investors at Tuesday’s annual meeting. Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, can’t afford to gloat, however. The company’s stock is flatlining, and plenty of speed bumps lie ahead.Mr. Einhorn contended that splitting the stock into one class of shares entitled to the company’s dividend in perpetuity and a separate class entitled to any additional profit generated by growth would attract more investors. He also argued that it would lift the company’s $52 billion market value by as much as $38 billion.General Motors countered that the plan would reduce its financial flexibility while doing nothing to improve the fundamentals of its business. It helped that Moody’s labeled the idea “credit negative” and that the proxy advisers Institutional Shareholders Services and Glass Lewis recommended that shareholders reject it. They did so overwhelmingly; more than 91 percent of those voting — 96 percent if Greenlight’s stake is excluded — backed the company.The valuation issue that prompted the hedge fund manager’s intervention hasn’t gone away, though. G.M. shares trade at just 5.59 times consensus earnings expectations for 2017, the lowest multiple of any profitable company in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. At just over $34 a share, the stock is barely above the price at its initial public offering in November 2010.Ms. Barra hasn’t been standing still. She is aggressively refreshing the company’s vehicle lineup, agreed in February to sell the European business to the PSA Group for $2.2 billion and expects to return $7 billion to shareholders this year through buybacks and dividends.The company is heading toward nasty-looking traffic, though. United States auto sales are softening and discounts are spreading to the sport utility vehicles and light trucks that generate a large chunk of Detroit’s profit. Spending heavily to develop electric cars and self-driving technology will make it even harder to maintain current levels of profitability.Ms. Barra can take some comfort from Tuesday’s shareholder support. But she has only to look at her crosstown rival, Ford Motor — which abruptly ejected Mark Fields last month — to realize how quickly that can evaporate. Steering General Motors to the future could yet be a rocky road."
"Donald J. Vidrine, Supervisor on Ill-Fated Deepwater Horizon Rig, Dies at 69","Donald J. Vidrine, who faced prosecution as one of two BP supervisors on the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, died on Saturday at his home in Baton Rouge, La. He was 69.Mr. Vidrine had been treated for cancer for the last three years, according to an obituary posted online by the Martin & Castille Funeral Home in Lafayette, La., an oil town where he had lived for most of his life.The explosion was one of the worst environmental disasters in the nation’s history, killing 11 workers, spilling millions of gallons of crude into the Gulf and badly damaging the reputation of BP. As technicians tried one thing after another to choke the well, millions of television viewers were captivated by videos taken by underwater cameras showing crude spewing from pipes into the water, day after day for nearly three months.Several investigations found multiple causes for the accident, including faulty cementing of the well. Prosecutors argued that Mr. Vidrine, the night rig supervisor, and Robert Kaluza, the day rig supervisor, botched a pressure test before the explosion that could have warned the oil workers to stop their operation to avert the blowout. The two were charged with manslaughter.But the manslaughter charges against Mr. Vidrine were dropped when he agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor pollution charge in 2015 and testify against Mr. Kaluza. Mr. Kaluza chose to go to trial and was acquitted last year.During Mr. Kaluza’s trial, Mr. Vidrine testified that Mr. Kaluza had neglected to give him vital information about the pressure test, which was intended to demonstrate whether two cement plugs and drilling mud below the ocean floor could withstand the pressure of oil and gas farther down in the well, below the seafloor.Mr. Kaluza’s defense lawyer said his client had stopped work on the well before his shift ended and was off duty when Mr. Vidrine decided to proceed with the drilling operation.Later, Mr. Kaluza said he held no bitterness toward Mr. Vidrine and understood the pressure he had been under to testify.In his earlier statements to BP investigators, Mr. Vidrine acknowledged that he had not been unduly worried about the tests. He said he had discussed the results with a BP executive in Houston who had also not appeared overly concerned.Mr. Vidrine was pilloried in the 2016 movie “Deepwater Horizon,” in which he was portrayed by John Malkovich as a strutting, fast-talking manager with a Louisiana accent as thick as gumbo who was in a rush to complete the ill-fated well.The real Mr. Vidrine tried to project a very different image. In emotional testimony before a congressional committee, he described himself as “just a guy who works for a living, a simple talker.”“I don’t try to get fancy with anybody,” he said.But the catastrophe in which he played a role cast a long shadow over the entire oil and gas industry as the federal government ordered a yearlong moratorium on deepwater drilling and tightened regulations.Donald Joseph Vidrine was born in Ville Platte, La., about 40 miles northwest of Lafayette, on Oct. 17, 1947. He graduated from McNeese State University in Lake Charles, La., in 1970.In an oil career of more than 40 years, he worked as an offshore supervisor on shallow- and deepwater rigs for Atlantic Richfield and then BP, after the company, formerly British Petroleum, bought Atlantic Richfield in 2000.He had a heart attack before contracting cancer during more than five years of legal problems.Mr. Vidrine, who lived for the last two years in Baton Rouge, is survived by his wife, Jacqueline Lafleur Vidrine; a son, Kevin; two sisters, Glenda Vidrine Miller and Cheryl Vidrine Lafleur; and two granddaughters."
Ponzi Scheme Meets Ransomware for a Doubly Malicious Attack,"SAN FRANCISCO — The first message to pop up on the computer screen let the victims know they had been hacked. The second message gave them a way out.The victim had a choice: Pay the hackers a ransom of one bitcoin, a digital currency worth roughly $2,365, in exchange for regaining access to the computer, or try to infect two new people on behalf of the attackers. If someone the victim knew fell for the bait and became infected, the attackers would consider the ransom paid and cede control of the infected computer.The attack late last year was, according to the cybersecurity researchers who discovered what they now call the Popcorn Time ransomware, the first Ponzi scheme for one of the internet’s oldest types of cyberattacks.Ransomware, a type of malicious software that infects a system and then holds it hostage, demanding a ransom for its release, is one of the most popular and lucrative ways to attack computers.Security companies estimate that criminals raked in roughly $1 billion from ransomware attacks in 2016. This year, the number is likely to be much higher, as ransomware schemes multiply. One strain, WannaCry, made global headlines last month by infecting hundreds of thousands of computers in 74 countries in about a day.The scheme has become more successful as more of what we do goes online, from business client lists to family photos. With the click of a button, an entire system can be infected. With another click, criminals can wipe information from a computer or expose it to the public. It all depends on what commands a bigger ransom: losing information or exposing it.Security researchers warn that WannaCry, which exploited a wide-ranging vulnerability in Windows systems and then used a clever mechanism to to spread itself across new systems, is just the tip of the iceberg. They are tracking new schemes dreamed up by criminals who have quickly realized that people are willing to pay hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in ransom.“This is a growing business because it works,” said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, a security firm based in Helsinki, Finland. “And the attacks are becoming more creative and effective.”Mr. Hypponen, whose team found and first reported on the Popcorn malware, said it was an outlier in the world of ransomware. It was the first attempt to combine a Ponzi, or pyramid scheme, in which one person entraps another, with malware that holds a computer hostage for payment. If it proved successful, he added, a number of criminal networks were likely to copy the model. Researchers are still monitoring the scheme to see if it works.“These networks all watch each other and learn. When a new model works, it quickly grows as others build on it,” Mr. Hypponen said.Asaf Cidon, a vice president at the security company Barracuda Networks who studies ransomware, said that criminals had become more sophisticated in the last year, especially in how they choose their victims.“Attackers will go after a specific department at a company, for instance human resources, where they know emails and links are more likely to get opened,” Mr. Cidon said. Networks will choose a company to target and then comb LinkedIn to draw a map of people employed by that company, he said.They might then use that map to impersonate various people or leverage their way into the company’s social network, ultimately using whatever means necessary to make sure that the system becomes infected with the ransomware.“We’ve seen them impersonate people within the company, or impersonate airlines sending ticketing information or vendors and customers of the company sending files,” Mr. Cidon said, adding that all businesses, from mom-and-pop shops to giant Silicon Valley companies like Facebook and Google, were getting hit by ransomware attacks.Other notable ransomware schemes discovered recently included a plot to infect internet-connected home devices, such as the LG Smart TV, by displaying a fake F.B.I. warning screen on the television and demanding $500 to unlock the it.Late last year, researchers carried out a proof-of-concept demonstration showing how internet-connected home thermostats, such as Nest, could be hacked and held hostage, leaving homeowners in the freezing cold (or blistering heat).“There is a lot of money at stake here, so criminals are always going to be interested,” said Mr. Hypponen, whose company is still tracking the fallout from last month’s WannaCry virus.Though the speed and effectiveness through which that particular attack spread caused it to make headlines, Mr. Hypponen said it was, in ransomware terms, unsuccessful.“WannaCry was a failure because it became too public, too visible and it made almost no money,” said Hypponen, citing the most recent figures that the ransomware netted just under $100,000 for the attackers, who have not yet been caught. WannaCry, he explained, was a victim of its own success. The more public it became, the more unlikely it was that a potential victim would pay out the ransom.He also said it was an innovative idea, as the attackers combined ransomware with malware that acted like an old internet scourge known as a “worm,” essentially spreading itself across systems as it infected them.While the first worm was created in 1988 by a Cornell graduate student named Robert Morris, who appeared to be more motivated by curiosity than malice, computer worms quickly became one of the most popular and destructive forms of cyberattacks.“This was a good idea, to combine the two processes together,” Mr. Hypponen said. “Other groups are watching this, and we are going to see other versions of this, better versions, soon.”"
"Mexico Agrees to Sugar Trade Deal, but U.S. Refiners Remain Unhappy","MEXICO CITY — Mexico agreed to demands from the United States to cut exports of refined sugar, striking a deal on Tuesday in a contentious trade negotiation that was closely watched as a prologue to talks on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement.The dispute stemmed from complaints by American sugar refiners that Mexico was taking advantage of unfair trade practices to dump refined sugar in the American market and at the same time limit the amount of raw sugar it exported to American refineries.The preliminary deal heads off the threat of punitive tariffs and maintains Mexico’s access to the American market. Mexico was forced to make significant concessions, but the American sugar industry, which had pushed for much tighter restrictions on Mexican sugar, opposed the deal.Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross, speaking at a news conference in Washington alongside Ildefonso Guajardo, Mexico’s economy minister, said, “We have gotten the Mexican side to agree to nearly every request made by the U.S. sugar industry to address flaws in the current system and ensure fair treatment of American sugar growers and refiners.”Mr. Ross continued, “Unfortunately, despite all of these gains, the U.S. sugar industry has said it is unable to support the new agreement, but we remain hopeful that further progress can be made during the drafting process.”Trade experts have kept a close eye on the sugar dispute to gauge the approach that Washington could take in talks to renegotiate Nafta. Although President Trump has backed away from his threat to pull the United States out of that regional trade accord with Mexico and Canada, the administration has given few clues as to how hard a line it will take.Talks could begin as early as August.“Conducting the negotiation on sugar trade against the background of a broader renegotiation of Nafta gave the United States significant bargaining leverage,” said Eswar Prasad, a trade expert at Cornell University. “A ratcheting-up of trade tensions could well have poisoned the broader negotiations, an outcome that Mexico clearly wanted to avoid.”The outlook for the coming Nafta talks did play a part in the calculations of the Mexican sugar industry, said Juan Cortina Gallardo, the president of Mexico’s sugar chamber.“We definitely gave up a lot,” he said. “Besides it making sense for the Mexican industry to sign the agreements, it also makes sense for Mexico to finish the agreement in a successful manner because of Nafta.”Mexico’s economy ministry tried to present the deal in a positive light, noting that the volume of sugar exports to the United States would remain the same and that Mexico’s cane growers would continue to receive the same price.The American Sugar Alliance, which represents large United States refiners, said Tuesday that the agreement contained a loophole that would allow Mexico to continue what it called unfair trade practices. Phillip Hayes, a spokesman for the alliance, said in a statement that the refiners would discuss how to close the loophole with Mr. Ross.“It is important to note that the U.S. sugar industry has made substantial compromises throughout the negotiations,” Mr. Hayes said.In an interview with Televisa of Mexico on Tuesday morning, Mr. Guajardo said regular contact with Mr. Ross over the sugar dispute had helped build a relationship of “credibility and confidence.”The deal also lifted the threat of Mexican retaliation against $500 million in American exports of high-fructose corn syrup, a substitute sweetener. If Washington had imposed the duties, Mexican sugar refiners said, they would have filed an antidumping claim against fructose.“We think it’s very important that the U.S. sugar industry be protected from subsidized dumping,” said John Bode, the president of the Corn Refiners Association.Still, if Mexican sugar were shut out of the American market, the United States would still need to import sugar from elsewhere, and the fructose industry would be punished.“The interest of the U.S. sugar industry is not necessarily the best definition of the U.S. public interest,” Mr. Bode said.The American sugar industry has long been protected by a price guarantee that is held in place by import quotas and other mechanisms. But under Nafta, Mexico won unrestricted access to the American market beginning in 2008.After a bumper crop in 2013 that doubled Mexican exports, American producers filed a complaint of unfair trade practices. In response, the Commerce Department imposed punitive duties as high as 80 percent.To avoid those duties, Mexico accepted limits on the price and volume of its exports in agreements signed at the end of 2014. But the American sugar industry, led by several large refining companies including the ASR Group in Florida and Imperial Sugar, argued that the agreements did not do enough to protect them.The agreement struck Tuesday keeps the 2014 agreements in place but lowers the percentage of refined sugar Mexico can send to the United States to 30 percent of its exports, from 53 percent. It also lowers the level of purity at which Mexican sugar can be sold as refined sugar.In response, Mexico has the option to supply 100 percent of any excess demand from the United States each year. The American Sugar Alliance said its objection to the accord was related to the conditions under which Mexico would meet that excess demand."
Justice Department Weighs In Against Wells Fargo in a Whistle-Blower Suit,"Fresh woes for Wells Fargo and a victory for two of its whistle-blowers occurred late Tuesday when the Justice Department filed a friend-of-the-court brief in a lawsuit brought against the bank by two former employees, who were fired after they tried to report misdeeds they had observed to their supervisors.The government’s filing adds heft to a long-running case that involves behavior that predates the 2008 financial crisis and the sham-accounts scandal that came to light at Wells Fargo last year.Although the Justice Department’s filing does not opine on the whistle-blowers’ claims, it argues that an appellate court should revise the analysis it made when it dismissed the case last year. Tuesday’s filing follows a Supreme Court ruling in February that also asked the appellate court to review the matter.The whistle-blowers who filed the case worked at Wachovia and World Savings, banks that were folded into Wells Fargo. In their complaint, filed in 2011, they contend that their employers engaged in mortgage improprieties and deceived federal regulators by hiding billions of dollars in losses from them. They filed the suit under the False Claims Act, which encourages individuals to come forward with evidence of fraud against the government. Plaintiffs who succeed in these cases receive part of the damages that are recovered.One of the plaintiffs is Paul Bishop, a former mortgage sales representative at World Savings; the other is Robert Kraus, an executive in commercial real estate at Wachovia. The men say they were fired after they alerted superiors to what they considered misdeeds at their institutions. Wells Fargo absorbed World Savings and Wachovia into its operations in 2008, and it has been vigorously defending the case.Mr. Bishop and Mr. Kraus argued that the hidden problems at Wachovia, which bought World Savings in 2006, made the bank appear financially stronger than it actually was. They contend that this represented a fraud on the government because the bank borrowed regularly from the Federal Reserve and received financial assistance during the crisis.Had regulators known the bank’s true financial position, it would have had to pay more for the federal aid it received, the complaint says. As a result, taxpayers should receive damages representing the difference between what the bank should have paid for assistance and what it actually paid.In a statement, Mary Eshet, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said: “We continue to believe these claims are without merit, as the previous court decisions have confirmed. We look forward to the opportunity to again present legal arguments to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.”The whistle-blower case has had its ups and downs. In 2014, the Justice Department declined to intervene. The Federal District Court that heard the case dismissed it in 2015, and the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed that decision in 2016.But last February, the Supreme Court ruled that some courts had been applying too narrow a legal standard when hearing lawsuits filed under the False Claims Act. The Supreme Court remanded the Wells Fargo case to the Second Circuit for reconsideration.Tejinder Singh, a partner at Goldstein & Russell who represents Mr. Bishop and Mr. Kraus, said the government’s filing in the case will benefit future whistle-blowers.“Because the government is the intended and principal beneficiary of cases brought under the False Claims Act, its position matters a great deal when it comes to the enforcement and interpretation of the statute,” Mr. Singh said in an interview.Mr. Bishop said he was thrilled the case had finally attracted the Justice Department.“As Martin Luther King said, the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice,” Mr. Bishop said, referring to Dr. King’s paraphrase of the 19th-century abolitionist and Unitarian minister Theodore Parker. “We’ve been at this a long time, and a lot of people, for whatever reason, haven’t shown up. Now the government has, and I’m happy.”"
"After Reality Winner’s Arrest, Media Asks: Did ‘Intercept’ Expose a Source?","Journalism in the Trump era has featured a staggering number of leaks from sources across the federal government, providing bombshell revelations about everything from clandestine meetings with Russian officials to petty infighting at the White House.But the arrest of Reality Leigh Winner, an intelligence contractor accused of leaking a classified report about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, has raised concerns about the measures taken by news organizations to protect confidential informers, with some reporters worrying about a chilling effect on potential sources.Veteran journalists did not hold back on Tuesday in criticizing The Intercept, the online news outlet that published an intelligence report from the National Security Agency. About an hour after the report’s publication on Monday, the Justice Department said it had charged Ms. Winner, 25, with violating the Espionage Act, saying she had leaked the report.The Intercept said it did not know the identity of its source, who mailed the document in a plain envelope. But an F.B.I. affidavit released on Monday described a series of actions by the news outlet, such as sharing a copy of the document with the National Security Agency, that allowed the document’s provenance to be quickly deduced.“I haven’t seen a mistake this consequential before,” said Barton Gellman, who reported for The Washington Post on the leaks provided by Edward J. Snowden.In an interview, Mr. Gellman said The Intercept’s scoop was “a really good story” from a professional organization that “knows a lot about this stuff — they have arguably the best operational security experts in journalism over there.”“So it’s baffling that they didn’t make use of them,” he added.National-security reporting is specialized, but journalists in the field said Tuesday that The Intercept had appeared to ignore some basic tenets.Sharing an original document when asking questions of government officials, as The Intercept appears to have done, can expose metadata and high-tech watermarks that may reveal a leaker’s identity. And an affidavit asserts that The Intercept revealed to a second contractor that the document was mailed from Augusta, Ga., where Ms. Winner resides.The Intercept’s editor in chief, Betsy Reed, said she was unable to comment further on Tuesday, citing the continuing investigation. But in a statement, the news organization sought to cast doubt on the government’s account of its reporting methods.“These documents contain unproven assertions and speculation designed to serve the government’s agenda and as such warrant skepticism,” the statement read. “Winner faces allegations that have not been proven. The same is true of the F.B.I.’s claims about how it came to arrest Winner.”News organizations, including The New York Times, have moved to establish secure channels for sensitive news tips and documents. But those efforts hinge on the perception that sources can be protected, especially when cases emerge like that of Ms. Winner, who could face prison time.“We as an industry just have to be ever vigilant,” said Stephen Engelberg, editor in chief of the investigative news outlet ProPublica. “We shouldn’t assume that if something comes in a plain brown envelope, that we don’t have a very high level of duty to protect the identity of a person, even anonymous to us.”President Trump, like his predecessor Barack Obama, has signaled a willingness to pursue and prosecute government leakers. On Monday, the Trump confidant Corey Lewandowski used Twitter to post an article about Ms. Winner’s arrest and added the caption “If you leak, you will be caught!”Mr. Gellman said, “It’s bound to scare the pants off some sources.”Bill Grueskin, who teaches at the Columbia School of Journalism, said that even in predigital days at The Miami Herald and The Wall Street Journal, he took pains to protect materials. “I would get so paranoid,” he recalled. “We had rules around this kind of thing: You would never just turn over the original or a copy of the document.”The Winner episode appeared to heighten the sensitivities of many journalists.One detail attracted particular interest: Agents analyzed the document and discovered creases, suggesting it had been printed out by someone with access.Asked if he was aware that a crease could reveal a source, Mr. Engelberg of ProPublica laughed. “It wouldn’t have been my first thought,” he said. “It will be now.”"
Pinterest Raises Valuation to $12.3 Billion With New Funding,"SAN FRANCISCO — Pinterest, the digital scrapbook company, has raised $150 million in a funding that raises its valuation to $12.3 billion.The funding makes Pinterest, which is based in San Francisco, one of the few privately held start-ups valued at more than $10 billion to raise money this year. The funding round, which was first reported by Bloomberg, brings a cash infusion that eases pressure for Pinterest to go public.The company, which has 175 million monthly users and is seven years old, said in a statement that it will use the new money to improve its visual-search-and-recommendations technology to make ads that people see more relevant to their interests, and to expand globally. The company declined to comment on an initial public offering.“It’s been out there that the company will do over $500 million in revenue this year,” said Ron Conway, who invested in Pinterest through his firm SV Angel. He said Pinterest had an opportunity to make more money because “users go to Pinterest with commercial intent.”“They look for a recipe and then want to buy everything in the recipe,” he said.When the messaging company Snap went public in March at a market capitalization of $24 billion, some investors hoped a slew of other large companies like Pinterest would have I.P.O.s. That would allow venture firms to cash out of their big bets and return money to investors.More than 30 venture-backed companies have gone public so far this year, according to the research firm CB Insights, but few are very large or widely recognized consumer brands."
Santander Rescues Troubled Rival in Test of Europe’s New Rules,"After the global financial crisis, Europe built a system designed to contain the collateral damage from failing banks. That new system appeared to pass its first test on Wednesday, as authorities efficiently dispatched a troubled Spanish lender.The relative lack of drama after the failure of Banco Popular, Spain’s fifth-biggest bank, highlighted the large strides made by the eurozone compared with a few years ago, when the problems of even small lenders had the potential to rock financial markets and raise existential questions about European unity.Bank stocks rose in Europe after authorities in Frankfurt and Brussels declared that Banco Popular was essentially a lost cause and sold it to Banco Santander, Spain’s largest bank. The swift action by European Central Bank and European Union officials defied critics who said a system for winding down sick banks, put into place at the end of 2014, was too unwieldy to deal with a fast-moving crisis.“It’s very positive for establishing the new banking policy framework,” said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. “It will demonstrate to a number of people that the framework is working better than many doubters expected.”The rescue is the first in which the European Central Bank has determined that a eurozone lender has failed or is about to fail. The central bank assumed authority over eurozone banks in 2014 as part of changes intended to prevent banking crises like that of 2008.But the failure of Banco Popular, felled by its exposure to toxic mortgages left over from a housing boom, was nevertheless a reminder that, nearly a decade after the financial crisis, the eurozone’s banking system remains vulnerable.Many banks in Italy, Germany and elsewhere in the 19-country euro area suffer from piles of bad loans, thin capital cushions and meager profits. The woes of banks continue to weigh on economic growth in the bloc.The decision by the European Central Bank to classify Banco Popular as a failed or nearly failed bank could also raise questions about whether the central bank is applying new regulations consistently. The Spanish bank’s takeover comes less than a week after the European Commission gave preliminary approval to plans for a government rescue of Monte dei Paschi di Siena, a troubled Italian bank.For Monte dei Paschi to qualify for government aid, the European Central Bank must determine that it is solvent. But by some measures, the Italian lender is in worse shape than Banco Popular. Monte dei Paschi fared significantly worse than the Spanish lender in assessments of bank health last year. The central bank could be accused of playing favorites if it clears the way for Monte dei Paschi to receive a taxpayer rescue.The path of the two banks also serves to illustrate the diverging economic fates of Spain and Italy.Spain, one of the countries hardest hit by the eurozone debt crisis in 2010, has since cleaned up many of its domestic banks — though clearly not Banco Popular — and taken politically unpopular steps to improve the functioning of the economy, like making it easier for companies to fire unwanted workers. Spanish unemployment is dropping from catastrophic levels and growth is among the fastest in the eurozone.By contrast, Italy is only beginning to institute such reforms, the economy is barely growing, and many Italian banks remain fragile. The government in Rome has not been willing to risk letting a big bank fail and perhaps creating a broad market panic.Italian authorities also feared the political ramifications if Monte dei Paschi collapsed. Without government aid, the bank would be forced to impose losses on thousands of middle-class savers who bought the bank’s bonds. There is fear the public backlash would benefit populist parties and add to political turmoil in the country.In Spain, the government signaled it did not want taxpayers to rescue Banco Popular, even though investors would bear some of the pain.If, as is likely, the European Central Bank allows the rescue of Monte dei Paschi to proceed, it can argue the situation is different than in Spain. By requesting approval to provide capital to Monte dei Paschi, the government triggered different procedures than apply to Banco Popular.Still, Mr. Véron of Bruegel predicted that Banco Popular’s collapse would prompt lawsuits by people who own its bonds and are losing their money.The Spanish bank’s problems stem from the large mortgage portfolio it built up during the country’s housing boom. When the European banking crisis struck in 2012, several lenders had to take emergency action, and Banco Popular opted to raise capital multiple times over the next four years.But its mortgage problems mounted, and it reported an annual loss of €3.5 billion in 2016. In February, it hired a new chairman, Emilio Saracho, to help lead a turnaround.Mr. Saracho set about selling nonstrategic assets and began looking for new ways to raise financing, before announcing in April that his bank might instead seek a merger. He eventually hired outside bankers to organize an auction, but Banco Popular said last week that it had failed to receive any formal offers.Shares of Banco Popular had dropped by more than half in the past week over concerns that the bank would need additional capital as it struggled under the weight of billions of euros in bad real estate loans.Officials at the European Central Bank, which is responsible for supervising eurozone banks, had been closely monitoring Banco Popular. By Tuesday, as it became clear that the bank could no longer borrow money from other banks and was running out of cash, the European Central Bank had determined that the lender was “failing or likely to fail.”“The significant deterioration of the liquidity situation of the bank in recent days led to a determination that the entity would have, in the near future, been unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fell due,” the central bank said.Responsibility for winding down Banco Popular then passed to the Single Resolution Board in Brussels, which sold the bank to Santander. The multilayered system had been criticized as too cumbersome, but functioned in this case.The combined business of Banco Popular and Santander will be led by the current management team of Santander Spain with Rami Aboukhair as chief executive, Santander said.“We welcome Banco Popular’s customers as part of the Santander Group and will work hard to continue serving them at the highest standards through the transition and beyond,” Ana Botín, the executive chairwoman of Santander, said in a news release.Still, while the acquisition averts a banking crisis, it also increases Santander’s dominance of the Spanish banking market and reduces competition, which could eventually be bad for customers.The takeover of Banco Popular comes five years after the near-collapse of a giant Spanish mortgage lender, Bankia. That forced the conservative government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to negotiate a huge European banking bailout. In the end, Spain needed €41 billion of bailout money."
Robot Cars Can’t Count on Us in an Emergency,"SAN FRANCISCO — Three years ago, Google’s self-driving car project abruptly shifted from designing a vehicle that would drive autonomously most of the time while occasionally requiring human oversight, to a slow-speed robot without a brake pedal, accelerator or steering wheel. In other words, human driving was no longer permitted.The company made the decision after giving self-driving cars to Google employees for their work commutes and recording what the passengers did while the autonomous system did the driving. In-car cameras recorded employees climbing into the back seat, climbing out of an open car window, and even smooching while the car was in motion, according to two former Google engineers.“We saw stuff that made us a little nervous,” Chris Urmson, a roboticist who was then head of the project, said at the time. He later mentioned in a blog post that the company had spotted a number of “silly” actions, including the driver turning around while the car was moving.Johnny Luu, a spokesman for Google’s self-driving car effort, now called Waymo, disputed the accounts that went beyond what Mr. Urmson described, but said behavior like an employee’s rummaging in the back seat for his laptop while the car was moving and other “egregious” acts contributed to shutting down the experiment.We humans are easily distracted by our games, phones and mates. And automotive engineers, computer interaction designers and, yes, lawyers, wonder if the self-driving cars they are working on will ever really be able to count on us in an emergency.Engineers say they believe that cars will be intelligent enough to do all the driving, somewhere between five years and a decade from now, depending on whom you ask. But until then, what passes for autonomous driving will be a delicate ballet between human and machine: Humans may be required to take the wheel at a moment’s notice when the computer can’t decide what to do.To outline a development path to complete autonomy, the automotive industry has established five levels of human-to-machine control, ranging from manual driving — Level 0 — up through complete autonomy, Level 6. In the middle, Level 3 is an approach in which the artificial intelligence driving the car may ask humans to take over in an emergency.But many automotive technologists are skeptical that the so-called handoff from machine to human can be counted on, because of the challenge of quickly bringing a distracted human back into control of a rapidly moving vehicle.“Do you really want last-minute handoffs?” said Stefan Heck, chief executive of Nauto, a start-up based in Palo Alto, Calif., that has developed a system that simultaneously observes both the driver and the outside environment and provides alerts and safety information. “There is a really good debate going on over whether it will be possible to solve the handoff problem.”Nauto’s data shows that a “driver distraction event” occurs, on average, every four miles. Mr. Heck said there was evidence that the inattention of human drivers was a factor in half of the approximately 40,000 traffic fatalities in the United States last year.Last month, a group of scientists at Stanford University presented research showing that most drivers required more than five seconds to regain control of a car when — while playing a game on a smartphone — they were abruptly required to return their attention to driving.Another group of Stanford researchers published research in the journal Science Robotics in December that highlighted a more subtle problem. Taking back control of a car is a very different experience at a high speed than at a low one, and adapting to the feel of the steering took a significant amount of time even when the test subjects were prepared for the handoff.“There is a motor-learning process if I haven’t been controlling the vehicle and I have to take control,” said J. Christian Gerdes, a Stanford University mechanical engineering professor who was one of the authors of the study.The handoff challenge is compounded by what is known as “over-trust” by automotive engineers.Over-trust was what Google observed when it saw its engineers not paying attention during commutes with prototype self-driving cars. Driver inattention was implied in a recent National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation that absolved the Tesla from blame in a 2016 Florida accident in which a Model S sedan drove under a tractor-trailer rig, killing the driver.Solving the over-trust issue is a key to autonomous vehicles in the Level 3 category, where the computer hands off to humans.The first commercial vehicle to offer Level 3 autonomy is expected to be released next month by Audi. A version of its luxury A8 model will be able to drive in stop-and-go freeway traffic up to 37 miles an hour while allowing drivers to pursue other tasks. The vehicle reportedly will notify drivers in emergencies, giving them eight to 10 seconds to intervene.Despite these limited advances, many automotive technologists remain uncertain about whether technology will ever be able to operate smoothly with a human driver who may be reading email or playing World of Warcraft.“I believe that Level 3 autonomous driving is unsolvable,” said John Leonard, a mechanical engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has collected detailed examples of driving situations that are currently impossible for state-of-the-art autonomous driving systems. “The notion that a human can be a reliable backup is a fallacy.”Yet, despite widespread skepticism, the automotive industry is spending heavily on artificial intelligence technologies designed to make cars safer before they are fully autonomous. The idea is that self-driving technology (warning lights, emergency braking) can help humans be safer drivers.Gill Pratt, a roboticist who heads an ambitious Toyota research effort in Silicon Valley; Ann Arbor, Mich.; and Cambridge, Mass.; said he did not see the automation ratings — one through five — as a straight line of technical progress.Instead, he said, he saw the ratings as different ways of addressing the same car-safety question, regardless of who or what is in control.Unlike many in the industry who say that advances in machine learning will soon make self-driving cars safer than those driven by humans, Mr. Pratt has pushed for less futuristic “guardian” technologies that could be added to a car the same way that anti-lock brakes, stability control, blind-spot warning lights and other features have become common.One possible new feature being designed by the Toyota Research Institute is adding the ability not just to stop when a pedestrian is detected, but also to swerve to avoid an accident, he said.Toyota is also working on technologies that will assist human drivers in remaining vigilant when they are required to oversee an autonomous driving system for long stretches of time. There is already a rich literature that explores the challenges of keeping airplane pilots vigilant; Toyota researchers say they will be able to develop techniques to maintain human driver attention.Mr. Pratt said Toyota had not given up on the challenge of Level 3 driving. But to make a safe Level 3 car, he said, it may be necessary to develop technologies that see risks as much as 15 seconds in the future.Still, over-trust will be a tough challenge to overcome. “Imagine if the autopilot disengages once in 10,000 miles,” he said. “You will be very tempted to over-trust the system. Then when it does mess up, you will be unprepared.”And if all those issues do get resolved, there is one more question: Will people really use self-driving cars?Last September, researchers at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute published results of a survey reporting that for 62 percent of Americans, an increase in productivity as a result of self-driving cars was unlikely.The researchers found that 23 percent of Americans would refuse to drive in autonomous cars and 36 percent would be so nervous that they would not take their eyes off the road. An additional 3 percent said they would be too motion-sick to take advantage of the cars.“Also of importance is the fact that current trips in light-duty vehicles average only about 19 minutes, a rather short duration for sustained productive activity or invigorating sleep,” the researchers concluded."
Movers: R.B.S. May Avoid Trial and a Spanish Banking Takeover,"We’re following major market developments throughout the day.The Royal Bank of Scotland moved closer on Wednesday to avoiding a trial in long-running shareholder litigation over a rights issue by the lender before its near-collapse in 2008.As the financial crisis loomed almost a decade ago, the lender raised 12 billion pounds, or about $15 billion at current exchange rates, weeks before it ultimately had to be rescued by the British government. R.B.S., which remains 72 percent owned by the government, received a £45 billion bailout that year.Investors in the shareholder litigation have claimed that they were misled about the bank’s financial health ahead of the share offering.The bank, based in Edinburgh, has agreed to settle about 87 percent of the remaining claims based on value against it after reaching an agreement with the RBoS Shareholders Action Group, which represents about 9,000 individual investors, according to Jonathan Nash, a lawyer for the shareholders.Shareholders representing the remaining claims are undecided and need more time to determine whether they want to proceed, Mr. Nash said on Wednesday.Mr. Nash said the bank and the shareholder group were confident the majority of those remaining claim holders would agreed to settle.The trial was supposed to begin last month, but has been delayed several times after R.B.S. increased the size of its settlement offer and the parties asked for more time to try to resolve the case. The revised settlement offer is worth about £200 million.Under an agreement between the parties on Wednesday, the trial will be put on hold and the undecided shareholders will have to decide if they want to settle by June 20.At the moment, there is no funding available for the case to continue, so any shareholders who want to go to trial would need to secure funding and notify the court by July 28. That is not expected to happen.Shares of Royal Bank of Scotland were up nearly 3 percent in afternoon trading in London on Wednesday. — CHAD BRAY• Spain’s largest lender, Banco Santander, has swooped in to rescue a troubled rival. The takeover is the first test of new rules intended to protect the eurozone economy from being hit by the collapse of a single bank.• The Reserve Bank of India has kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, but cut its forecast for inflation.• Don’t forget to read the DealBook Morning Agenda."
Backing Up Your Backup Drive,"Q. I keep my photos, videos and other multimedia files stored on an external USB drive to save space on my computer’s main hard drive, and I also back up vital folders there. But how do I back up the external drive in case it goes south?A. You can create multiple backups of your important data in several ways, including on multiple external drives, to a home network server or to an online cloud-storage locker. In these days of ransomware and other data-corrupting attacks, having a backup drive that is not always connected to your computer (and therefore not vulnerable to online attack or spreading malware) can be another way to protect your files.A one-terabyte external USB drive can cost $75 or less online, so alternating drives on a regular basis is one way to safely copy your files each day while keeping one drive unconnected. Backup programs like Acronis Backup & Recovery 10 can be configured to back up the computer to multiple USB drives at once if you are confident in your security software and do not want to manually swap external drives each day.Large-capacity hardware like network-attached storage devices or other storage solutions (like those made by Drobo, Seagate or Western Digital) are other options to back up your external drive’s contents. The Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times, recommends the $250 QNAP Turbo NAS as the best network-attached storage server for home users.Backing up your external drive to an online server creates an additional copy of your data — and one that is not in the same physical location as your computer and external drive. Backblaze is among the online services that can back up external USB drives, although it does not do Apple’s Time Machine drives and network-attached storage servers; prices start at $5 a month. The Wirecutter picks CrashPlan as its top online backup solution, and the company’s $60-a-year service can also back up external USB drives. Both Backblaze and CrashPlan offer free trial periods so you can try out the service before committing."
Facebook’s Role in European Elections Under Scrutiny,"Lawrence Dodd lives in one of Britain’s most fiercely fought voting districts, and he has been peppered almost daily with ads from the country’s major political parties on Facebook. About a month ago, he tried to find out why.Mr. Dodd, a maker of musical instruments in northern England, joined an experiment. He and around 10,000 others volunteered their data, allowing researchers to monitor in real time which political ads were showing up in their Facebook news feeds as Britain’s election approached.Their goal: to shed more light on how political campaigns are using Facebook and other digital services — technologies that are quickly reshaping the democratic process, but which often offer few details about their outsize roles in elections worldwide.“These political ads aren’t regulated; nobody knows what is being said on Facebook,” said Mr. Dodd, 26, who planned to vote for the Labour Party on Thursday elections, but who continued to be bombarded with online messages from the Conservatives. “Wherever politics is concerned, there needs to more transparency.”Facebook provides little information on how political parties use ads to reach undecided voters on the site. And concern has been growing since the American presidential election about the company’s role in campaigns, including about how politically charged fake news is spread online.Now, as voters head to the polls across Europe, groups in Britain, Germany and elsewhere are fighting back, creating new ways to track and monitor digital political ads and misinformation on the social network and on other digital services like Twitter and Google.The political ads shown to Mr. Dodd are being tallied by WhoTargetsMe?, a nonpolitical group that designed a digital tool to monitor Facebook’s role ahead of the British election.Costing less than $1,000 to build, the technology, which works as a plug-in on desktop web browsers and anonymizes users’ personal information, was created because the social network does not share information on political ads shown to its more than 36 million users in Britain, roughly half the country’s population.That lack of information has raised hackles about the activities of both Facebook and politicians in a country where campaigns are highly regulated and political financing is tightly capped.Questions over the social network’s role in politics are particularly raw in Britain, where outside groups were accused of spending lavishly on Facebook during a heated campaign before a referendum on the country’s membership the European Union. In response, Britain’s privacy watchdog has started an investigation into whether such targeted political advertising breached its strict data protection rules.“Political advertising is fundamentally different; there’s a lot of concern about what’s being seen on Facebook,” said Sam Jeffers, the group’s co-founder and a former digital media strategist. “The people deserve some sense of what’s going on.”As the volunteer group is not completely representative of the British population, the data is by no means perfect, highlighting the difficulty of tracking political activity on Facebook.In the buildup to the election, for instance, the data showed that the Liberal Democrats — who are likely to remain a minority presence in Parliament — posted the largest number of political ads on Facebook. The Conservative Party was second, despite the political party’s pledge to spend 1 million pounds, or $1.3 million, on social media messaging. The Labour Party, which planned to spend a similar amount, was in third place.Initially, all the British parties spent money on broad-brush messages that blanketed the social network without targeting specific voters. But as Election Day approached, that strategy began to change.An analysis of the data by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit media organization, showed the country’s major parties were increasingly targeting specific voting districts and wavering voter groups with direct Facebook ads. The number of ads seen by WhoTargetsMe? volunteers has also roughly doubled in the last month, though political messages still represented 2 percent of overall ads displayed in Facebook feeds, according to the group’s analysis.The ads have included Conservative Party messages about potential nuclear energy jobs in three areas in northern England with ties to the industry, and that are some of the country’s most contested districts. By contrast, the Labour Party targeted older women nationwide with directed ads about potential threats to their pensions.“It’s a fundamental conversation to have about how we regulate this,” said Nick Anstead, a media and communications expert at the London School of Economics. “Facebook has a responsibility to tell its users who is buying advertising that is targeting their votes.”In response, the company says its roughly two billion users worldwide have complete control over which ads they are shown on the network, and that it is the responsibility of individual political parties to comply with their countries’ electoral laws. Facebook adds that its commercial agreements and protection of individuals’ privacy restrict it from sharing more data on how information is distributed on the platform.“Facebook’s goal is to make it easier for people to get the information they need to vote,” Andy Stone, a company spokesman, said in a statement. “We encourage any and all candidates, groups and voters to use our platform to engage in the elections.”Facebook and other technology companies have tried to improve what is shared and circulated online, creating partnerships with news outlets to debunk digital falsehoods and cracking down on how fake news websites make money through advertising on social media. The social networking giant also sponsored get-out-the-vote campaigns, and encouraged political groups to create Facebook pages to promote their messages.Yet during the recent French presidential election, which pitted the centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron against the far-right hopeful Marine Le Pen, several media organizations including Le Monde said they had found it difficult — and overly cumbersome — to report potential fake news items about the candidates to Facebook.Academics and others scrutinizing the vote also said the company’s failure to provide data on what Facebook users in France shared among themselves made it virtually impossible to determine if false reports spread on the network affected the overall result.“Facebook’s lack of transparency is a big concern,” said Tommaso Venturini, a researcher at the médialab of Sciences Po, a prestigious university in Paris, who tracked fake news across social media during the French election.For Ben Scott, such issues bring back mixed memories of the American presidential election, when he was a digital consultant for Hillary Clinton’s campaign.He has now turned his attention to a project at the New Responsibility Foundation, a Berlin-based research organization that is monitoring the spread and impact of fake news ahead of Germany’s election in September.He and his team are categorizing potential online misinformation in a digital database, tracking how these false reports spread across social media and the wider web and conducting focus groups to gauge the impact on voters’ decisions.The role of companies like Facebook in spreading online falsehoods is limited in Germany, Mr. Scott said, because social media does not play as significant a role in everyday politics as it does in the United States.Still, the social media giant — which has roughly 36 million users in Germany — is a force to reckon with in the coming election.Despite Mr. Scott’s discussions with Facebook about potential collaborations, the company has so far declined to give his research project any data on how local users share potential misinformation among themselves on the social network.“If we see something getting significant media attention and there’s a sudden spike,” Mr. Scott said, “then we can guess there’s something going on inside Facebook.”"
A Guide to Challenges Facing Self-Driving Car Technologists,"SAN FRANCISCO — In the minds of many in Silicon Valley and in the auto industry, it is inevitable that cars will eventually drive themselves. It is simply a matter of how long it will take for the technology to be reliably safe.But as indicated by Google’s challenges with the so-called handoff between machines and humans — not to mention Uber’s problems during recent tests on the streets of San Francisco — there is a lot more work to be done before self-driving cars are ready for the mainstream. Here are some of the challenges facing technologists. The ability to respond to spoken commands or hand signals from law enforcement or highway safety employees.There are subtle signals that humans take for granted: the body language of a traffic control officer, for example, or a bicyclist trying to make eye contact. How do you teach a computer human intuition? Perhaps the only way is endless hours of road testing, so that machines can learn the interactions that humans have been socialized to understand. Driving safely despite unclear lane markings.This, too, is a question of intuition. The most challenging driving environments require self-driving cars to make guidance decisions without white lines, Botts Dots (those little plastic bumps that mark lanes) or clear demarcations at the edge of the road.Notably, California may phase out Botts Dots on its roads because, among other issues, they are not believed to be an effective lane-marking tool for automated vehicles. In short, the highway infrastructure is going to have to change over time to interact with computer-driven vehicles. Reliably recognizing traffic lights that are not working.Picking out traffic lights is now done reliably by self-driving car vision systems. Making correct decisions in the event of a power failure is more challenging. Yet again, it’s a question of teaching a machine human intuition and how to cooperate among multiple vehicles. Making left turns into intersections with fast-moving traffic.Merging into rapidly flowing lanes of traffic is a delicate task that often requires eye contact with oncoming drivers. How can machines subtly let other machines and humans know what they are trying to do? Researchers are considering solutions like electronic signs and car-to-car communications systems. Detecting which small objects in the roadway must be avoided.Recognizing objects is something that machine-vision systems can now do reliably. But so-called scene understanding, which would inform a determination like whether a bag on the road is empty or hides a brick inside, is more challenging for computer vision systems. The ability to operate safely in all weather conditions. Software improvements to lidar (short for light detection and ranging) technology may help someday, but not yet.Lidar systems can’t be fooled by darkness or sun glare. But if you’re wondering whether the lidar systems in self-driving cars have problems in rain or snow, you’re on to something. Heavy rain or snow can confuse current car radar and lidar systems, making it necessary for humans to intervene. Cybersecurity. There is no evidence yet that autonomous cars will be any more secure than any other networked computers.A self-driving car is a collection of networked computers and sensors wirelessly connected to the outside world. Keeping the systems safe from intruders who may wish to crash cars — or turn them into weapons — may be the most daunting challenge facing autonomous driving."
New York Times Co. Promotes Executive to Chief Operating Officer,"The New York Times announced on Wednesday that it had promoted Meredith Kopit Levien, who had been its chief revenue officer since 2015, to executive vice president and chief operating officer, as part of a restructuring of The Times’s digital departments.The company also announced that Kinsey Wilson, who joined The Times in 2015 and had been the executive vice president overseeing product and technology, would not stay on in a permanent role. His position is being eliminated. He will continue to advise senior leaders “on a range of strategic matters,” according to a news release.In Ms. Levien’s new role, she is expected to oversee teams responsible for product, design, audience and brand, consumer revenue, advertising and NYT Beta, which develops new digital products like Cooking and Watching.In a joint interview on Wednesday, Ms. Levien and Mark Thompson, the president and chief executive of The Times, said the reorganization was intended to accelerate the pace of the company’s digital businesses. They said a simplified structure would aim to free employees to make decisions more quickly.“We have to move at the speed that people, the consumers of our product, are moving at,” Ms. Levien said.Mr. Wilson, who was previously the executive vice president and chief content officer at NPR, was originally hired by the newsroom, but his role quickly expanded to include the business-side product and technology teams. Mr. Thompson credited him with playing a key role in the development of podcasting at The Times, including “The Daily,” a popular political podcast hosted by the Times reporter Michael Barbaro.In his advising role, Mr. Wilson will “guide the creation of an expanded audio strategy” and “continue to play a central role in developing The Times’s relationships with Facebook, Apple and Google,” Mr. Thompson wrote in an email to the employees.Mr. Thompson and Ms. Levien pointed to the success of “The Daily” and said that The Times hoped to produce more of this kind of product. There was little debate or discussion of how the podcast would fit in with a drive for subscriptions, Ms. Levien said — instead, it was quickly brought to market and has proved to be a hit with listeners.A similar story played out with virtual reality, an area about which Mr. Thompson internally expressed skepticism. The Times went ahead with its push in the new storytelling field, and sponsorship money has made the effort profitable.But Mr. Thompson said he had heard from managers that processes were more often too slow and “committee-based.” The challenge for The Times, he said, is taking “the spirit of creative innovation that we see in things like the podcast, and applying it to everything we do.”In the email to the company’s employees, Mr. Thompson wrote that The Times would “accept greater risk in return for faster execution.”Ms. Levien was hired in 2013 from Forbes, where she was chief revenue officer, and served almost two years as the executive vice president in charge of advertising. She was promoted to chief revenue officer in 2015.“She reinvented advertising with dramatic and rapid business success, but also cultural success,” Mr. Thompson said.Under Ms. Levien, The Times has approached 2 million digital-only news subscriptions, expanded its use of native advertising and created T Brand Studio, a marketing agency.In May, The Times reported $399 million in total revenue for the most recent quarter, up 5 percent compared with the first quarter of 2016. Print advertising continued a steady decline, but the company reported a 19 percent gain in digital advertising revenue and an 11 percent increase in circulation revenue, buoyed by the addition of 308,000 net digital-only news subscriptions."
Why Car Companies Are Hiring Computer Security Experts,"It started about seven years ago. Iran’s top nuclear scientists were being assassinated in a string of similar attacks: Assailants on motorcycles were pulling up to their moving cars, attaching magnetic bombs and detonating them after the motorcyclists had fled the scene.In another seven years, security experts warn, assassins won’t need motorcycles or magnetic bombs. All they’ll need is a laptop and code to send driverless cars careering off a bridge, colliding with a driverless truck or coming to an unexpected stop in the middle of fast-moving traffic.Automakers may call them self-driving cars. But hackers call them computers that travel over 100 miles an hour.“These are no longer cars,” said Marc Rogers, the principal security researcher at the cybersecurity firm CloudFlare. “These are data centers on wheels. Any part of the car that talks to the outside world is a potential inroad for attackers.”Those fears came into focus two years ago when two “white hat” hackers — researchers who look for computer vulnerabilities to spot problems and fix them, rather than to commit a crime or cause problems — successfully gained access to a Jeep Cherokee from their computer miles away. They rendered their crash-test dummy (in this case a nervous reporter) powerless over his vehicle and disabling his transmission in the middle of a highway.The hackers, Chris Valasek and Charlie Miller (now security researchers respectively at Uber and Didi, an Uber competitor in China), discovered an electronic route from the Jeep’s entertainment system to its dashboard. From there, they had control of the vehicle’s steering, brakes and transmission — everything they needed to paralyze their crash test dummy in the middle of a highway.“Car hacking makes great headlines, but remember: No one has ever had their car hacked by a bad guy,” Mr. Miller wrote on Twitter last Sunday. “It’s only ever been performed by researchers.”Still, the research by Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek came at a steep price for Jeep’s manufacturer, Fiat Chrysler, which was forced to recall 1.4 million of its vehicles as a result of the hacking experiment.It is no wonder that Mary Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, called cybersecurity her company’s top priority last year. Now the skills of researchers and so-called white hat hackers are in high demand among automakers and tech companies pushing ahead with driverless car projects.Uber, Tesla, Apple and Didi in China have been actively recruiting white hat hackers like Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek from one another as well as from traditional cybersecurity firms and academia.Last year, Tesla poached Aaron Sigel, Apple’s manager of security for its iOS operating system. Uber poached Chris Gates, formerly a white hat hacker at Facebook. Didi poached Mr. Miller from Uber, where he had gone to work after the Jeep hack. And security firms have seen dozens of engineers leave their ranks for autonomous-car projects.Mr. Miller said he left Uber for Didi, in part, because his new Chinese employer has given him more freedom to discuss his work.“Carmakers seem to be taking the threat of cyberattack more seriously, but I’d still like to see more transparency from them,” Mr. Miller wrote on Twitter on Saturday.Like a number of big tech companies, Tesla and Fiat Chrysler started paying out rewards to hackers who turn over flaws the hackers discover in their systems. GM has done something similar, though critics say GM’s program is limited when compared with the ones offered by tech companies, and so far no rewards have been paid out.One year after the Jeep hack by Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek, they demonstrated all the other ways they could mess with a Jeep driver, including hijacking the vehicle’s cruise control, swerving the steering wheel 180 degrees or slamming on the parking brake in high-speed traffic — all from a computer in the back of the car. (Those exploits ended with their test Jeep in a ditch and calls to a local tow company.)Granted, they had to be in the Jeep to make all that happen. But it was evidence of what is possible.The Jeep penetration was preceded by a  2011 hack by security researchers at the University of Washington and the University of California, San Diego, who were the first to remotely hack a sedan and ultimately control its brakes via Bluetooth. The researchers warned car companies that the more connected cars become, the more likely they are to get hacked.Security researchers have also had their way with Tesla’s software-heavy Model S car. In 2015, Mr. Rogers, together with Kevin Mahaffey, the chief technology officer of the cybersecurity company Lookout, found a way to control various Tesla functions from their physically connected laptop.One year later, a team of Chinese researchers at Tencent took their research a step further, hacking a moving Tesla Model S and controlling its brakes from 12 miles away. Unlike Chrysler, Tesla was able to dispatch a remote patch to fix the security holes that made the hacks possible.In all the cases, the car hacks were the work of well meaning, white hat security researchers. But the lesson for all automakers was clear.The motivations to hack vehicles are limitless. When it learned of Mr. Rogers’s and Mr. Mahaffey’s investigation into Tesla’s Model S, a Chinese app-maker asked Mr. Rogers if he would be interested in sharing, or possibly selling, his discovery, he said. (The app maker was looking for a backdoor to secretly install its app on Tesla’s dashboard.)Criminals have not yet shown they have found back doors into connected vehicles, though for years, they have been actively developing, trading and deploying tools that can intercept car key communications.But as more driverless and semiautonomous cars hit the open roads, they will become a more worthy target. Security experts warn that driverless cars present a far more complex, intriguing and vulnerable “attack surface” for hackers. Each new “connected” car feature introduces greater complexity, and with complexity inevitably comes vulnerability.Twenty years ago, cars had, on average, one million lines of code. The General Motors 2010 Chevrolet Volt had about 10 million lines of code — more than an F-35 fighter jet.Today, an average car has more than 100 million lines of code. Automakers predict it won’t be long before they have 200 million. When you stop to consider that, on average, there are 15 to 50 defects per 1,000 lines of software code, the potentially exploitable weaknesses add up quickly.The only difference between computer code and driverless car code is that, “Unlike data center enterprise security — where the biggest threat is loss of data — in automotive security, it’s loss of life,” said David Barzilai, a co-founder of Karamba Security, an Israeli start-up that is working on addressing automotive security.To truly secure autonomous vehicles, security experts say, automakers will have to address the inevitable vulnerabilities that pop up in new sensors and car computers, address inherent vulnerabilities in the base car itself and, perhaps most challenging of all, bridge the cultural divide between automakers and software companies.“The genie is out of the bottle, and to solve this problem will require a major cultural shift,” said Mr. Mahaffey of the cybersecurity company Lookout. “And an automaker that truly values cybersecurity will treat security vulnerabilities the same they would an airbag recall. We have not seen that industrywide shift yet.”There will be winners and losers, Mr. Mahaffey added: “Automakers that transform themselves into software companies will win. Others will get left behind.”"
Daily Report: When Robots Can’t Trust Humans,"One thing about being a technology pioneer is that you get to discover problems before anyone else. So it was with Google and its self-driving car project.Several years ago, Google thought it was a good idea to ask a number of its employees to use the company’s self-driving cars on their daily commutes to the office. The company recorded what the engineers did while the machine did the driving; what it found was, as a company spokesman put it, “egregious” behavior.In other words, the employees were not paying attention to the road. And that’s a problem when self-driving cars are designed to hand control back to the driver in an emergency.The results of Google’s experiment unnerved the autonomous-car developers enough that they went back to the drawing board. Instead of trying to manage the handoff between machine and man, Google decided to keep at it until the company had a vehicle that could handle every bit of the driving — so much so, in fact, that later prototypes didn’t even have steering wheels or brake pedals.In the first of a series of articles that look at the challenges of creating self-driving cars, John Markoff examines this handoff problem and asks if it can ever truly be resolved.There are other technical issues for autonomous vehicles, like teaching machines an artificial version of human intuition and keeping hackers out of what could be described as supercomputers on wheels.That cars will one day drive themselves seems to many technologists just a matter of time. But let’s hope the cars won’t need our help."
Ideas Sparked by the Ebbs and Flows of Twitter Conversations,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Jenna Wortham, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine and co-host of the “Still Processing” podcast, discussed the tech she is using.As the host of a podcast, are there any special tools that you really like? Luckily, my only responsibility for “Still Processing” is to show up and talk. All the alchemy required to turn our babbling into a coherent weekly show is handled by the geniuses at Pineapple Street Media.But I would say that keeping a dedicated notebook and pen on my person at all times, to jot down ideas, theories, reference points and jokes to share with my co-host, Wesley Morris, is an essential tool for that job. I’m partial to a Muji recycled paper sketch book and a Sharpie ultrafine marker. I also really like any messaging app that lets me record and send voice notes — they’re super helpful for bombarding Wesley with complex ideas, and also for sending myself thoughts that are too abstract to write down.You recently wrote a column criticizing Silicon Valley for lacking tools to combat online harassment. As someone with 661,000 Twitter followers, you must face this problem from time to time. What’s your advice for readers who want to protect themselves from online bullies?Familiarize yourself with the resources at hand to combat online bullying, and report offenders as often as you need to. Don’t hesitate to report and block. There are a few organizations devoted to helping people at risk: The Crash Override Network and Hack Blossom are the two that immediately come to mind, though I'm sure there are more.Have a good support system offline of people who can calm you down after a vicious attack. And read inspirational stories of people you admire who dealt with bullying (my personal icons include the writer and activist Janet Mock; Katherine Johnson, the NASA scientist whose life was featured in “Hidden Figures”; and even Rihanna. Yes, RIHANNA!) — and remember that most exceptional humans weren’t always widely understood in their lifetime, either.What do you like about Twitter?I like the lazy river aimlessness of it, the way you can get caught up in a current, and an emotion, a feeling, the spirit of a television show. I am in awe at the communal collectivity that exists there, the way we now gather online to celebrate wins, like “Moonlight” at the Oscars, and grieve and share anger over unnecessary deaths like that of Jordan Edwards, and express outrage over policies like the Muslim travel ban.I have to credit “Black Twitter” with my sanity. The way BT takes a news story or a meme and runs with it is my all-time favorite thing online these days. It’s the best real-time commentary we have, outside of something like “Saturday Night Live.”But it’s not one day a week, or limited to what a handful of writers thinks is relevant. It’s 24/7, whimsical, cutting and sharp.How does Twitter help you do your job? Does it create ideas? Years ago, Twitter used to be a major tip line for story ideas. It was a great way to see what start-ups were trending, and glean insights into companies and scoop up the occasional scrap of venture-capital gossip. But now it’s too much — everyone’s id is on overdrive and not always in a good way. It oscillates between being a delight and a stress inducer.Recently, someone who goes by @Blaqueer gave us a good idea for the podcast, suggesting we talk about our cultural memory of Whitney Houston. We did, and people loved it! If anything, Twitter helps me read about perspectives outside of mainstream media and learn about new authors, artists and ideas that I don’t always get exposed to in my regular media diet.Twitter is also responsible for one of the most fulfilling creative collaborations in my life. A year or so ago, I struck up a direct message exchange on Twitter with Kimberly Drew, who runs the Instagram account @museummammy. We became close friends and started working together on a book project that is currently called “The Black Futures Project.” It concerns itself with cataloging and archiving this particular moment in contemporary blackness in the postdigital era, and was acquired by Christopher Jackson’s One World imprint late last year.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?

It’s up there with the greatest Ponzi schemes of our lifetime. Part of me low-key respects their hustle. But a bigger part of me is dismayed about what their existence means about the types of ideas and entrepreneurs that get funding in Silicon Valley. That company got around $120 million to sell an internet-connected juicer that seems to be no better than a packet of Go-Gurt.A recent report from Kathryn Finney’s phenomenal organization Digital Undivided found that venture firms lend white men $1.3 million on average, even if their start-up fails. Black women get a paltry $36,000 on average. It’s infuriating, and it frustrates me to no end."
Uber Fires Executive Over Handling of Rape Investigation in India,"SAN FRANCISCO — Uber has fired a senior executive who obtained the medical records of a woman who was raped by an Uber driver in India, the latest example of misconduct unearthed at the ride-hailing giant.Eric Alexander, Uber’s president of business in Asia, was terminated on Tuesday after reporters began asking questions about his actions, according to three people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it.The episode provides more ammunition to critics of Uber who say the company’s top officials have set a tone that fosters dysfunction.Uber has spent the past three months confronting a series of explosive claims about misconduct in its offices around the world, including accusations of sexual harassment and discrimination. Next week, employees are expected to hear the results of an investigation into the company’s culture led by Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general who is now a partner at the law firm Covington and Burling.Uber said at a staff meeting on Tuesday that it had fired 20 employees in recent months over issues raised in another investigation, while dozens of other employees remain on notice or in training programs meant to address problems that emerged in that inquiry.Mr. Alexander was not among those employees. As investigators pursued tips from rank-and-file Uber workers about problems at the company, top executives did not disclose that they knew Mr. Alexander had obtained the records of the Indian woman, according to two of the people familiar with the matter. Both Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, and Emil Michael, the company’s senior vice president of business, had read and discussed the woman’s medical records with Mr. Alexander at length, according to those people.Mr. Alexander, who was based in Hong Kong, is a longtime confidant of Mr. Michael’s; the two worked together as far back as 15 years ago at the start-up Tellme Networks. Mr. Alexander was also one of Mr. Kalanick’s most trusted lieutenants. The three men once attended a South Korean escort bar together, according to two of the people familiar with the medical-records matter. That trip prompted a complaint to Uber’s human resources department.The actions that led to Mr. Alexander’s termination began in late 2014, when it became public that a woman had accused an Uber driver of raping her after she dozed off on a ride to her home in the Delhi region.Critics condemned Uber over its screening practices when it emerged that the driver had previously been detained for months on suspicion of rape in a different case. Uber responded to the episode by introducing increased safety measures in its vehicles, including a kind of panic button for passengers who felt unsafe. Uber eventually settled a lawsuit the woman filed against the company; the driver was convicted of rape.The attack came at a fraught time for Uber. The company was banned in Delhi after the story broke, putting at risk Uber’s plan to dominate the market in India, a country of more than 1.3 billion people that the company hoped would fuel enormous growth. Uber had also just closed a $1.4 billion round of financing, and was in the middle of talking to other companies about more financing.Mr. Alexander was convinced that the rape charges were part of a plan hatched by Ola, the leading ride-hailing company in India and one of Uber’s largest Asian competitors, according to two of the people familiar with the matter. He spent months in India as Uber established itself there, and conducted his own investigation. He shared his concerns with Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Michael, who were also fixated on the case, according to the two people.Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Alexander had long telephone conversations about what they believed to be subterfuge on the woman’s part, trying to figure out how to rectify the situation, according to two people familiar with those talks. Mr. Alexander carried the woman’s records, which he believed were at odds with her account, with him. The ban imposed on the company in Delhi added to their suspicions.Uber declined to comment on the firing of Mr. Alexander, and he did not respond to a request for comment. Recode first reported news of his termination.Current and former Uber employees were surprised to learn that Mr. Alexander was not one of the 20 employees that Uber said on Tuesday it had fired. He was let go only after reporters asked Uber about his actions, despite several high-level executives having knowledge of the matter, according to two of the people familiar with the matter.For now, Uber employees are awaiting the results of Mr. Holder’s investigation. The company is expected to address his findings at a meeting for all employees on Tuesday."
"Out With the New at E3, as the Old Stays in Play","Surprises are always a key part of E3, the giant video game convention that opens its doors next week in Los Angeles. Innovative new game titles and hardware are essential for stirring up excitement among gamers, which keeps them emptying their wallets.Next week, details are expected about an update to Microsoft’s Xbox One console, called Project Scorpio, that will support 4K video and virtual reality. Super Mario Odyssey for Nintendo’s new Switch console will be another highlight.But the outsize emphasis on the new at E3 disguises an important change in the game business over the past few years: The old has never mattered so much before.It used to be that a game publisher would put out a big title and, if it hit all the right notes, the game would sell well for a few months. But over the past five years, publishers — especially those of the big console games that dominate E3 — have used the internet to keep their games fresh with new content, finding new ways of keeping players engaged with the games and spending money on them through sales of virtual goods. Old games seem less old because they are regularly being updated with new things to do and see, giving them a shot of digital Botox.This reflects an important change in the game business toward providing a service that is constantly being enhanced, rather than selling discs wrapped in cellophane that mostly do not change after a customer purchases them.“The games industry has followed the same example investors have seen with Netflix,” said Joost van Dreunen, chief executive at SuperData Research, a game research firm. “Entertainment in general is undergoing this tremendous shift.”For an example, look no further than Grand Theft Auto V, the gritty action-adventure game from Rockstar Games, which first came out in September 2013, almost four years ago. Grand Theft Auto V was published so long ago that it was initially released on the last generation of console hardware from Sony and Microsoft, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 (Versions followed for newer hardware in November 2014 and for PCs after that.)And yet, there was Grand Theft Auto on the best-selling games list as recently as April, when it ranked sixth in the United States by dollar sales, right up there with games released this year like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, according to NPD Group, the market research firm. More than 80 million copies of Grand Theft Auto V have been sold since it was released, according to Take-Two Interactive Software, the publisher that owns Rockstar Games.Part of Grand Theft Auto V’s enduring appeal is that it is an exceptional game, with a 97 out of 100 score on Metacritic, which aggregates reviews from game critics. But the way Rockstar has kept the game performing at such a high level years after its release is through the internet.Anyone who buys Grand Theft Auto V gets free access to Grand Theft Auto Online, a multiplayer internet version that was released around the time the game was first published in 2013. Rockstar routinely pushes out free updates to the online game — 12 major ones during the last fiscal year alone — that provide new scenery and action. Another big update, called Gunrunning, is expected next week.The constant refurbishing has kept the community of Grand Theft Auto players, who typically have to wait four to five years between totally new versions of the game, paying attention. “It allows us to stay in touch with consumers between huge, tent-pole releases,” said Strauss Zelnick, the chief executive of Take-Two, in a phone interview.There’s a financial motive for Take-Two. While players can do many things free, there are plenty of opportunities for them to buy virtual weapons, vehicles and other items to make their online game-playing more fun. In April, Grand Theft Auto V ranked third among all console games in digital spending, according to SuperData Research.In a significant milestone, Take-Two reported that for its last fiscal year, which ended March 31, slightly more than half of its revenue of $1.78 billion came from digital online sources.Of that digital revenue, a little over half came from people buying full, downloadable versions of games rather than physical copies, while the rest came from purchases of virtual currency and add-on digital content. Grand Theft Auto V has generated digital revenue of $1.6 billion over its life, Mr. van Dreunen of SuperData Research estimated.The funnel of digital revenue between major releases of games means the feast-or-famine cycle that used to characterize Take-Two’s financial results — huge spikes in revenue after big Grand Theft Auto releases, followed by deep troughs — is no longer as severe.“We don’t see as much of that now because every two or three months you’re seeing new content being added to keep users engaged in the franchise universe,” said Yoshio Osaki, president of IDG Consulting, a market research and consulting firm focused on the game industry.Digital revenue also carries higher profit margins than sales of physical game discs, because no manufacturing is involved and distribution costs are lower.Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard, among other big game publishers, have also heavily invested in expanding the internet side of their businesses, which has created longer legs for many of their games. As a result, stock prices of both publishers and Take-Two have increased by triple digits over the past four years.Still, most copies of Take-Two’s games, including Grand Theft Auto, are sold on discs in stores. To make a lot of digital revenue on games, Take-Two needs to sell as many physical copies as possible. That means building buzz at events like E3 with new products.“Physical distribution partners are terribly important for us,” Mr. Zelnick said, “and we expect that to continue for some time to come.”"
‘Must-See TV’: Free Drinks and Canceled Meetings for Comey’s Testimony,"The schedule has been cleared and the popcorn readied at Evergreen Partners, a strategic communications firm in central New Jersey, where the rule for employees on Thursday morning is simple: No client talk while James B. Comey is speaking.“We canceled meetings when we saw what time it was on,” said the firm’s president, Karen J. Kessler, who is planning a cheese-and-crackers spread by her office’s 60-inch screen. “It’s must-see TV.”Americans do not agree on much these days. But millions are expected to pause on Thursday to take in a spectacle already being compared to other political-cultural touchstones, like the Army-McCarthy hearings and Anita Hill’s testimony about Clarence Thomas. This time, Mr. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, will dish to the Senate Intelligence Committee about President Trump, the man who fired him.By the time details from Mr. Comey’s prepared remarks surfaced on Wednesday — revealing an anxious president pressing his F.B.I. director about a continuing investigation into his campaign’s contacts with Russia — the hearing had leapt from Beltway curiosity to required viewing, a cliffhanger episode of the nation’s real-life reality show.C-Span, this is not. (Although C-Span will be covering it.) Every national broadcast network — along with an alphabet soup of cable stations from CNBC to HLN — plans to carry the 10 a.m. hearing live. Bars in Houston, San Francisco and Washington are opening early. Schoolteachers are remaking lesson plans to discuss the testimony instead.Adding to the anticipation: Mr. Trump is expected to be among the viewers, and there is speculation that he may respond to Mr. Comey on Twitter in real-time — “Mystery Science Theater 3000” in the West Wing.“They really should declare a national holiday,” said Sally Quinn, the journalist and the doyenne of Washington’s social circuit, “since no work is going to get done.”Enterprising establishments have been quick to capitalize on the Super Bowl-like atmosphere. At Union Pub in Washington, a sports bar steps from the Hart Senate Office Building, bartenders plan to dole out a free round of Budweisers or bourbon shots every time Mr. Trump blasts out a tweet.For those wondering: No, there will not be a limit. “We’ll give out 20 rounds” if the president tweets 20 times, Ashley Saunders, the bar’s general manager, said in an interview.As she spoke, Ms. Saunders was testing a way to create a huge display of Mr. Trump’s Twitter feed that would run alongside the live coverage on the bar’s 18 television screens — the better for her Capitol Hill clientele to follow any presidential play-by-play.“I wouldn’t be surprised if people took half-days or take the day off,” Ms. Saunders said. “If I had a normal job, I don’t know what I’d be doing.”Broadcast networks rarely cut into lucrative morning programming for news events — especially for congressional testimony, typically a dry-as-sawdust slog of grandstanding lawmakers and nondescript witnesses. But the potential for scandalous revelations has a way of reeling in ratings.The 1987 testimony of Lt. Col. Oliver L. North at the Iran-contra hearings lured nearly five times as many viewers as the era’s most popular soap opera, “General Hospital.” One network estimated at the time that as many as 55 million people watched all or part of the hearing. Justice Thomas’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings, deemed R-rated for frank allegations of sexual harassment, drew bigger audiences than some of the competing baseball playoffs in 1991.Discussing his network’s decision to run special coverage of Mr. Comey’s testimony, Ryan Kadro, a CBS News executive producer, said: “It was a no-brainer for us. Our affiliates want it, and we want it.”Not everyone at Jimmy’s Ice House in Houston might agree.A dive bar 1,400 miles away from the nation’s capital, Jimmy’s is popular with military veterans like Doug Samuels, a retired Navy officer who voted for Mr. Trump. Nursing a Bud Light on Wednesday, Mr. Samuels said he was unlikely to watch the Comey broadcast live.“I’d rather just listen to the pundits discuss it afterward,” he said, a display of pro-Trump bumper stickers on a nearby table’s legs.“The thing with Comey is he wanted to make himself famous,” Mr. Samuels said. “I don’t think he’s going to have anything new to say.”He added: “It’s a diversion so that Democrats can keep attention off the things that really need looking into.”If Mr. Samuels decides to tune in, he will have the option: The Jimmy’s bartender, Leah Bradley, said the bar would probably show the hearing live.Mr. Comey’s appearance before Congress in March, when he still had his job, was the last time the broadcast networks broke in for a live congressional hearing. Mr. Kadro said CBS planned to carry much of Mr. Comey’s testimony, including his questioning by senators.If Mr. Trump tweets, the CBS team — anchored in New York by John Dickerson, Gayle King, Norah O’Donnell and Charlie Rose — will be ready. The crew has rehearsed scenarios to ensure that viewers can be notified of any presidential retorts as they happen. “We’re going to be covering the way the event is reverberating out to Washington and to the world,” Mr. Kadro said.In Gaithersburg, Md., Joshua Schuman said he planned to lead a discussion about the testimony in his 10th-grade government class at Quince Orchard High School. For the past few weeks, his students have been asking about the latest headlines on their iPhones concerning the F.B.I. director’s coming testimony.All the Comey questions were cutting into class time.“I’ve warned them that it could be incredibly anti-climactic,” Mr. Schuman wrote in an email on Wednesday. “But most of them are pretty intrigued by the fact that the president seems to have possibly broken the law.”Mr. Schuman is preparing to talk about highlights from the hearing, with an eye toward just how unusual the situation has become.“I’ve really been emphasizing that this isn’t ‘business as usual’ in Washington,” Mr. Schuman wrote. “It’s more like a real-life political thriller — ‘Game of Thrones,’ playing out down the street.”"
European Central Bank Meeting Focuses on ‘Forward Guidance’,"FRANKFURT — Forward guidance might sound like something to mount on the dashboard of a car. But in the world of monetary policy it is a crucial concept, one that was the focus of the European Central Bank’s meeting on Thursday.In its latest policy-setting discussion, the bank moved ever so cautiously toward the day when it will ease off on the stimulus it has been providing to the eurozone economy.Mario Draghi, the central bank’s president, sought to address the intense interest among investors and economists in how quickly the central bank will reduce its purchases of government and corporate bonds, a form of money printing known as quantitative easing.The European Central Bank did not announce any policy changes on Thursday when it met in Tallinn, Estonia. And it made only small changes to its forward guidance.But at a news conference afterward, Mr. Draghi expressed more confidence in the eurozone economy. A strong economy is a precondition for any move by the central bank to cut back its bond buying.To prevent market turmoil, Mr. Draghi wants to give investors ample warning of what is coming. But he also wants to leave room to maneuver if economic conditions change.Navigating that communications minefield is what forward guidance is about.Here are some of the important points from the news conference:The European Central Bank has promised to continue buying bonds at least through the end of the year “or beyond, if necessary.”It is the beyond part that analysts are trying to figure out.Mr. Draghi disappointed those who had predicted he would indicate how long quantitative easing will last beyond December, and how quickly the volume of the purchases will be reduced or tapered. Mr. Draghi refused even to say when the central bank will announce its intentions. “It was not discussed,” he said. “The E.C.B. will be in the market a long time.”Many analysts had expected a stronger statement. The euro fell against the dollar as investors recalibrated their expectations of when the European Central Bank will allow market interest rates to rise.In an opening statement approved by other members of the central bank’s governing council, Mr. Draghi said that economic risks were “broadly balanced.” That was a more optimistic assessment than Mr. Draghi gave at his last news conference in April, when he said that risks to growth were “still tilted to the downside.”In the meantime, unemployment has continued to fall, while growth has been better than expected. Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics office, on Thursday revised upward its estimate of eurozone growth in the first three months of the year to 0.6 percent from 0.5 percent.But stronger growth will not prompt a change in monetary policy unless it is accompanied by higher inflation, which is still nowhere in sight.The European Central Bank has said it will not touch its benchmark interest rates until it has ended the bond buying program and, in any case, will keep rates low for “an extended period of time.”Still, analysts have already begun speculating about when the first rate increases might occur.There was some excitement before the news conference when the central bank, in a routine statement announcing that benchmark interest rates remained unchanged, dropped a phrase emphasizing that it could reduce rates further if needed.The prices of trillions of dollars in bonds and other securities can hang on such minor adjustments in central bank wording.But Mr. Draghi blunted the impact of the change when he said during the news conference that, of course, the central bank can reduce rates at any time and is prepared to do so if needed.He said that the change in phraseology reflected the central bank’s confidence that there is no longer any danger of deflation, a dangerous drop in consumer prices that would require aggressive action to combat.Inflation, the central bank’s most important economic indicator, continues to fluctuate at levels below the official target (which is below but close to 2 percent).As he has in the past, Mr. Draghi dismissed spikes in consumer prices as a result of transient factors, such as the price of oil.In addition, on Thursday the central bank’s in-house economists lowered their forecasts for inflation through 2019, saying in effect that prices are not going anywhere and will remain well below the 2 percent target.The central bank’s main job is to control inflation. As long as price growth remains subdued, it will feel obligated to keep priming the economy.“Underlying inflation is basically staying what it is today,” Mr. Draghi said."
Digging the Graveyard of Oil’s Past,"Moored off the port of Rotterdam, Netherlands, Pioneering Spirit looms so large that it is difficult to recognize as a ship. The crew of 450 is dwarfed by the cranes and pipes that dominate the sprawling layers of decks.For decades, Edward Heerema, head of Allseas, the Swiss-based energy services company, dreamed of building a giant vessel to install oil platforms offshore. But the Pioneering Spirit has found another purpose: dismantling oil fields in the British North Sea.With oil prices dropping sharply in the last two years, Mr. Heerema said he was now just focused on finding enough work to meet his payroll. “I can’t say how long it will take to pay for itself. Maybe 10 years, maybe 30 years,” he said of the ship.The British North Sea was once a crucial source of oil for the world. At its peak in 1999, it produced about 2.9 million barrels of oil a day, more than Kuwait or Iraq at the time.Since then, production has generally been in a long slide as oil fields discovered decades ago are exhausted and high costs discourage new exploration. Its diminishing fortunes have been cemented by the rise of renewables and the push for cleaner alternatives to oil.“It is one of those signs that we may be at a tipping point,” said Anthony Hobley, chief executive of Carbon Tracker, a nonprofit group that studies the investment risks of the shifting energy landscape. “We may well be at that critical point in history where people will say that this is the point where the oil industry reached its peak and began to decline.”This spring, the Pioneering Spirit headed to the Brent field in the North Sea, a major oil and gas trove named after the Brent goose. The field helped define the business, giving its name to Brent crude, the global price benchmark for oil.After 40 years of production, the field is nearly pumped out. And a group of four platforms in the field — giant rigs that stand around 1,000 feet tall and weigh a combined million tons — are gradually being shut down.This spring, the Pioneering Spirit transported one platform to its final resting place, a shipyard in Hartlepool in northeast England where it is being dismantled and sold for scrap. An industry in itself, this so-called decommissioning process creates jobs and profits along the journey.Discovered in 1971, the Brent field was one of several major finds that turned the North Sea into a world-class oil region. Companies like Royal Dutch Shell, which operates the Brent field, and Exxon Mobil, its co-owner, focused their investments in the West, after a wave of nationalization in the Middle East and elsewhere.The North Sea is a vast operation, with more than 300 fields scattered across 95,000 square miles. Shell built four giant platforms in the Brent field, called Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta, capable of withstanding giant waves and hostile weather.Shell must safely dismantle these monsters and plug more than 100 wells below them. The company estimates that the process will last a decade and cost billions of dollars, some paid by British taxpayers.Such exercises will be increasingly common in the North Sea and other oil regions. Around 100 platforms are expected to be dismantled in British waters over the next decade.Shell figures that hiring Pioneering Spirit to cart the platforms to shore where they can be dismantled is cheaper and safer than busting them up at sea. “The biggest risk is putting people on helicopters,” said Alistair Hope, Shell’s project director, referring to the usual means of transportation to offshore platforms.The oil companies do not want a repeat of the mid-1990s. Back then, Shell’s plan to sink a piece of Brent equipment, called Brent Spar, in the ocean depths caused a bruising fight with environmental groups led by Greenpeace and prompted stricter regulation.Delta, the first platform to be taken apart, consists of what is known as a topside, a kind of offshore petroleum factory and hotel with accommodation for more than 160 people. The platform rests on concrete legs that weigh a combined 300,000 tons.In late April, Pioneering Spirit lifted the ungainly structure off the legs and carried it off like a spider grasping prey. Shell wants to leave the concrete stumps, which contain some oil, in place at sea, saying they pose minimal risk to shipping routes and have less chance of polluting the environment that way.Once Brent Delta reached the port in Hartlepool, the platform became the property of Able UK.In the mid-1990s, Peter Stephenson, Able’s owner, bought an old shipyard, capitalizing on the industrial area’s decline. When the financial crisis struck, he took advantage of cheap steel prices to invest £28 million in facilities, like a reinforced dock to bear the weight of the platform.As Able workers break apart the rig, Shell will continue to watch over the process, to make sure that hazardous or polluting material like asbestos or small amounts of remaining oil are handled properly.Workers will strip off anything valuable, like brass valves or other metal equipment. Larger pieces will gradually be cut loose and brought to the ground. They will most likely be sold to steel mills, which melt scrap to make new metal.Mr. Stephenson, 70, has squeezed a fortune of an estimated 430 million pounds out of unwanted properties over the last six decades. At 19, he started out buying a broken front loader, a machine for scooping dirt into trucks — then fixing it and hiring it out. He later moved into demolition.In recent years, Able has dismantled ships for the United States Navy, as well as the French aircraft carrier Clemenceau. He recently began buying idled coal-fired power plants, breaking them up for scrap and redeveloping their sites.Mr. Stephenson sees value in everything.He has turned the living quarters of a scrapped BP offshore platform into a makeshift motel and office for workers of drilling rigs that come into the yard for maintenance. A helicopter deck is being cut up for bridging material.The future of energy is represented, too. A torpedo-shaped device discarded by General Electric was a prototype for a machine that generates electricity from ocean waves.As the Brent Delta platform moved through the channel, a group of Mr. Stephenson’s friends, family and associates ate roast pork and stuffing, ham and peas pudding and other regional fare in a white tent pitched by the water. Winning a big job is a lift for a region that has been hit by the decline of some mainstay industries like the recently shuttered Redcar steel plant visible in the distance.“This proves the northeast can still do stuff,” said Marcus Walker, a project director at Coolsilk, a local real estate investment firm.Mr. Stephenson says the Brent contract will preserve or create up to 50 jobs. His company makes a practice of hiring and buying locally. A catering company called The Old Butchers Sandwich Shop provided food to guests and workers on the yard.“There have been a lot of peaks and troughs over the last few years,” said Heidi McCullagh, who runs the catering company. “When a contract comes in, you have suddenly got a queue at the door.”"
Morning Agenda: Triple-Threat Thursday,"Don’t be surprised if work appears to stop at 10 a.m. Eastern time.That’s when James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, testifies in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and millions of Americans are expected to pause what they are doing and tune in.The New York Times will be providing live coverage of the proceedings.Investors are already on edge as they monitor the British national elections and the European Central Bank’s monetary policy meeting — making for a day that some analysts have called Triple-Threat Thursday.So far, markets have been relatively calm.American stock markets ended higher on Wednesday after Mr. Comey’s prepared remarks for the Senate committee revealed no surprises.The Lawfare blog, however, contends in its preview to  Mr. Comey’s appearance that his testimony will be significant, even if there aren’t any bombshell revelations.And, of course, many will be watching President Trump’s Twitter account for his reactions.As for events in Britain, Politico has a guide: “How to Watch the British Election Like a Pro.” Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party is expected to win, but its lead has narrowed in recent weeks.An early indication of the election results will come via an exit poll at 10 p.m. in Britain (5 p.m. Eastern), after voting has concluded. During the election and in the days after, the reaction of the pound will be watched closely.Of the three major events on Thursday, investors say they believe that the European Central Bank will shock markets the least: It is expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate at zero percent.Eric Alexander, Uber’s president of business in Asia, was fired after he obtained the medical records of a woman who was raped by one of the company’s drivers in India. (The website Recode first reported the firing.)The dismissal of Mr. Alexander occurred on Tuesday after reporters began asking questions about his actions, according to three people familiar with the matter.In late 2014, when a woman accused an Uber driver of raping her after she dozed off during a ride to her home in the Delhi region, Mr. Alexander was convinced that the rape charges were part of a plan hatched by Ola, a rival ride-hailing company in India, according to two of the people familiar with the matter.He conducted his own investigation, obtaining the woman’s records, which he believed were at odds with her account, and shared his concerns with Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, and with Emil Michael, Uber’s senior vice president of business, according to the two people.Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google dominate the daily lives of many Americans.They are also excelling on the stock markets.Investors are piling into their stocks, and the companies’ share prices have risen far faster than the major market indexes over the past three years: Amazon is up 206 percent; Apple, the laggard among the five, has risen 67 percent.But this gold-rush mentality has analysts worried about the sky-high valuations.“No one is feeling totally comfortable holding stocks that are this expensive,” said Ed Yardeni, an independent investment strategist.• Yahoo shareholders will vote on the sale of the company’s internet businesses to Verizon Communications for about $4.5 billion, a transaction that they are almost certain to approve."
The Benefits of Talking to Yourself,"A stranger approached me at a grocery store. “Do you need help finding something?” he asked. At first, I wasn’t sure what he meant. Then the realization kicked in: I was talking out loud, to myself, in public. It was a habit I’d grown so comfortable with that I didn’t even realize I was doing it.The fairly common habit of talking aloud to yourself is what psychologists call external self-talk. And although self-talk is sometimes looked at as just an eccentric quirk, research has found that it can influence behavior and cognition.“Language provides us with this tool to gain distance from our own experiences when we’re reflecting on our lives. And that’s really why it’s useful,” said Ethan Kross, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan.When we talk to ourselves we’re trying to see things more objectively, Mr. Kross said, so it matters how you talk to yourself. The two types of self-talk you’re likely most familiar with are instructional self-talk, like talking yourself through a task, and motivational self-talk, like telling yourself, “I can do this.” It might be corny, but motivating yourself out loud can work.One study published in Procedia — Social and Behavioral Sciences researched the effects of both motivational and instructional self-talk on subjects playing basketball. It found that players passed the basketball faster when they motivated themselves through the task out loud.Even how you refer to yourself when talking to yourself can make a difference. Mr. Kross and his colleagues studied the impact of internal self-talk — talking to yourself in your head — to see how it can affect attitudes and feelings. They found that when their subjects talked about themselves in the second or third person — for example, “You can do this” or “Jane can do this” instead of “I can do this” — not only did they feel less anxiety while performing, but their peers also rated their performances better. Mr. Kross said this was because of self-distancing: focusing on the self from the distanced perspective of a third person, even though that person is you.“In terms of why psychological distance helps, the example I like to give is to think about a time with a friend or loved one ruminating about a problem,” Mr. Kross said. “As an outsider, it’s relatively easy for you to advise them through that problem. One of the key reasons why we’re so able to advise others on a problem is because we’re not sucked into those problems. We can think more clearly because we have distance from the experience.”So if you’re frazzled and need a motivational pep talk, you might consider giving it in the second or third person, which can help you look at the situation from a logical, objective perspective rather than an emotional, biased one.Beyond motivational self-talk, talking to yourself out loud in an instructional way can speed up cognitive abilities in relation to problem-solving and task performance.So, for example, when you’re searching for that item you just can’t find at the grocery store, talking to yourself out loud may help you find it faster. This is because of the feedback hypothesis.“The idea is, if you hear a word, does that help you see something?” said Gary Lupyan, a researcher and psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.According to the feedback hypothesis, the name of an item and its label make you think of what that item looks like. “This helps you distinguish it from other items with different names,” Mr. Lupyan said.Mr. Lupyan wanted to test the feedback hypothesis with self-talk. In a series of experiments, he and his team asked subjects to search for different objects in different situations. In one experiment, subjects were asked to search for a picture of a specific item, like a banana, among 20 pictures of random items.“We had some of the subjects say the name of the object out loud to themselves,” he said. “The idea was, does saying the name actually help you activate its visual features?”Mr. Lupyan and his colleagues found that when subjects said the word “banana” before searching for a picture of one, they found the picture faster and more accurately. Saying the word out loud, the study found, made the subjects more aware of its physical traits, which then made the banana stand out among other objects.It’s worth noting, however, that this type of self-talk isn’t as effective if you don’t know what the item looks like. In other words, if you’re searching for a papaya and you have no idea what a papaya looks like, asking yourself, “Where are the papayas?” probably won’t do much for you.“The finding was that saying a name out loud helps, but only with objects they have familiarity with,” Mr. Lupyan said. Without that familiarity, talking to yourself out loud can slow you down, he added.Instructive self-talk can be useful beyond finding your lost car keys or picking out a friend in a crowd. The aforementioned basketball study also found that players passed and shot the basketball more accurately when they instructed themselves through the task out loud, suggesting that talking to yourself about what you’re doing can keep you focused. The study concluded that motivational self-talk worked best on tasks based on speed, strength and power, while instructional self-talk worked best with tasks that involved focus, strategy and technique. In the real world, this might translate to parallel parking, following a recipe or putting together an Ikea side table.“My bet is that self-talk works best on problems where you’re trying to stay on task and there are possible distractions,” Mr. Lupyan said. “For tasks with a multistep sequence, talking to yourself out loud can help you keep out distractions and remind yourself where you are.”"
Automakers Race to Get Ahead of Silicon Valley on Car-Sharing,"SEATTLE — On a recent overcast afternoon in this city’s Belltown neighborhood, a driver pulled up in a gleaming new BMW X1 sport utility vehicle just a few minutes after a few swipes of a smartphone app had summoned it.This was not a car dispatched by Uber or Lyft, the two tech companies that are the Coke and Pepsi of ride-sharing services. Instead, the vehicle belonged to the company that made it, BMW Group, through a service it owns called ReachNow.The ride-sharing service represents the latest effort by a car manufacturer to get a grip on the technological trends that could disrupt their businesses by making vehicle ownership — and eventually even drivers — unnecessary. BMW and Daimler, maker of Mercedes-Benz, are two of the most aggressive carmakers building their own “mobility services” to prevent Silicon Valley’s upstarts from keeping all the spoils themselves.For both, a major focus has been building short-term rental services; customers drive themselves. On Thursday, ReachNow branched out to ride-sharing (in which drivers pick up passengers) by expanding a small private test of the service in Seattle to all of the service’s members in the city.Both Daimler and BMW said their current mobility services were helping them with know-how, including valuable data about customer patterns, to prepare them for a future when their cars drive themselves. When a customer can hail a fully autonomous vehicle through an app (which could take a decade or two), they say the distinction between the two mobility services will go away.“When you have autonomous driving, car-sharing and ride-sharing will become absolutely the same,” said Bernhard Blättel, vice president for BMW i Mobility Services, which includes its ReachNow service.Daimler beat its luxury auto rival to the car-sharing market in 2008 with its Car2Go service in Germany. Now it has more than 2.4 million members in 26 cities across nine countries, with more than 800,000 members in North America. While it started with two-seater vehicles from Daimler’s Smart division, the service now lets customers rent the company’s more luxurious Mercedes GLA and CLA models.Car2Go is a twist on traditional car-rental services: It allows members to hop into vehicles for a quick trip to a grocery store or a concert; they pay for use of the car by the minute (hourly and daily rates are available, too).What’s more convenient is that customers can return the cars by parking them on the streets; a Car2Go smartphone app locates the cars for pickup. The company has parking arrangements with cities so customers don’t have to feed meters.BMW began its first car-sharing service, DriveNow, in Europe in 2011 in a joint venture with the rental car company Sixt; it now has about 875,000 members for the service. Last year it established ReachNow, its North American car-sharing service, as a wholly owned subsidiary based in Seattle. Now about 50,000 members in that city; Portland, Ore.; and Brooklyn can rent various models from BMW’s Mini brand, along with other BMW models.Last year, General Motors formed a car-sharing service called Maven after the company acquired the assets of the start-up Sidecar. Earlier this year, GM introduced a related service, Maven Gig, that lets drivers for Lyft, Uber and ride-sharing services rent Chevy Bolts.Including Daimler, BMW and services from other companies, there were over 1.9 million car-sharing members in North America, more than double the number five years ago, according to estimates by Susan Shaheen and Adam Cohen, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley.Last year, U.C. Berkeley’s Transportation Sustainability Research Center, which Ms. Shaheen co-directs, published results of a three-year study of nearly 10,000 Car2Go members in five North American cities. It found that the car-sharing service reduced private vehicle ownership and miles traveled in cars in those cities; this, in turn, reduced greenhouse gas emissions. From 2 to 5 percent of the Car2Go members sold a vehicle, and an additional 7 to 10 percent did not acquire one because of the service.While their core businesses remain making and selling vehicles, car manufacturers are feverishly experimenting with new services that get people using their products in an age when car ownership is no longer as appealing as it once was.“If they stay away from those trends and don’t insert themselves into this evolving ecosystem of mobility services, there’s a risk they get left behind,” Ms. Shaheen said.While manufacturers are starting their car-sharing services long in advance of the availability of fully autonomous vehicles, much of what they are doing today is a prelude to such vehicles’ arrival. “We gain valuable experience and knowledge when it comes to aspects that will be relevant in a robotic vehicle scenario,” said Joerg Lamparter, head of Daimler Mobility Services.That includes knowing how to operate a fleet of vehicles in a city, keeping them clean and running smoothly and ensuring that the cars are fueled or charged up. Data helps them understand how to rebalance the location of vehicles to meet anticipated demand from customers.Today, the car-sharing services have to send an employee out to move vehicles to more optimal pickup locations. In the future, the cars will do that themselves. But a thicket of technological, safety and policy issues will have to be ironed out first.BMW has announced it is working with Intel to start production of self-driving cars by 2021. Daimler has announced a partnership to bring self-driving cars to Uber’s service.While ReachNow’s new ride-sharing service in Seattle may seem like a detour from its start in car-sharing, it’s just another way for BMW to get more use from the growing number of cars it is putting on roads in the city.Since December, ReachNow has been privately testing its service, with about 2,000 members. It has about 80 drivers, who work for an independent company. For now, ReachNow will only pick up ride-sharing customers in the central areas of the city, though they will take customers to any neighborhood and the airport.Steve Banfield, the chief executive of ReachNow, said in an interview at the company’s headquarters that the company was seeking to give people a variety of options for getting around a city. “Sometimes they want to be driven,” he said. “Sometimes they want to drive. Sometimes they want to take a car for several days, sometimes for 10 minutes.”“By creating a set of services that blend these use cases, it enables us to learn how people want to move in and around a city,” Mr. Banfield said. “It really gets us a lot closer to the consumer in terms of their mobility needs going forward.”"

"Broadway Tickets, for the Price of an Economics Lesson","With the Tony Awards coming on Sunday night, I decided this week that I’d better bite the bullet and buy tickets to “Hello, Dolly!” in case Bette Midler wins best actress and tickets become even more scarce and expensive.I knew the tickets would be steep. Thanks to what’s known as dynamic pricing, in which costs shift constantly to match demand, top ticket prices for hit shows on Broadway have hit previously unheard-of levels. Annual Broadway ticket sales reached a record $1.45 billion for the just-ended season.Last month The Times reported that the top box-office price for “Hello, Dolly!” was $748. For the phenomenon “Hamilton,” it was $849.When I went online Wednesday, the top price for that night’s performance of “Hello, Dolly!” at several ticket resellers was $1,450, give or take a few dollars. (It was sold out both on Telecharge and at the Shubert Theater box office.)As premium ticket prices have soared, many buyers have responded with outrage, accusing theater owners of price gouging and bemoaning the emergence of Broadway as one more exclusive preserve for the ultrarich. Both themes were prominent in reader comments on the Times article.But guess what? There was also one “Hello, Dolly!” ticket for $194 on Wednesday evening available from an online reseller, albeit for a balcony seat. And there were more than a dozen seats at prices well below $750.And if you’re willing to forgo the potentially once-in-a-lifetime experience of seeing Bette Midler as Dolly Levi, TodayTix, a relatively new purveyor, was offering seats for future performances starring the critically lauded Donna Murphy — for $39.The venerable TKTS booth in Times Square had 22 Broadway shows on offer for Wednesday evening, nearly all at 50 percent off.“People have been whipped into a frenzy by the top prices,” said Thomas Schumacher, president of the Disney Theatrical Group, producer of the current, dynamically priced hit musicals “The Lion King” and “Aladdin.” “If you’re a regular person who wants to see a Broadway show tonight, you can. There are tickets for $29. You may be priced out of the best seats at the hottest shows, but the same is true of a deluxe suite at the St. Regis or a restaurant on New Year’s Day.”Even at hit shows, relatively few seats sell at headline-making prices. Mr. Schumacher noted that the average price of a ticket for “Aladdin,” one of the five top-grossing shows on Broadway, was $112 last year.Average Broadway ticket prices last season rose to $109 from the prior season’s $103, a 5.8 percent increase. That’s more than the rate of inflation but still not exorbitant considering the disproportionate impact of a few megahits like “Hamilton.” (The higher prices compensated for — or perhaps contributed to — a decline in the number of tickets sold.)As more transactions shift to the internet, consumers will have to get used to a world in which dynamic pricing is increasingly the norm. They’ve pretty much accepted it for airline fares; airlines pioneered the concept years ago. It has since spread to hotel rooms, sporting events, concerts and designer clothing — and is likely to be used for just about any highly differentiated product where demand may at times far exceed supply.“At the most basic level, all pricing is about allocating scarce resources,” said Robert Phillips, the head of marketplace optimization sciences at Uber, the car service that has pioneered surge pricing in local transportation. Surge pricing is another form of dynamic pricing. (Mr. Phillips previously headed Columbia University’s Center for Pricing and Revenue Management.)“I’ve worked in theater, concerts and sports,” he said, “and they all have a similar problem: For extreme hits, demand at what people would consider a reasonable price far exceeds supply.”From an economics perspective, “this is simply a rationing problem,” he added. “If you keep prices low, people will buy tickets and resell them on the secondary market. Someone is going to pay a market-clearing price, no matter how high. The only question is who should get the money: the investors and performers and creators, or a speculator who managed to snap up the tickets the moment the box office opened?”However creative the product, says Howard Sherman, director of the Arts Integrity Initiative for the New School College of Performing Arts, Broadway is not immune from the forces of any marketplace.“As somebody who believes theater and live performing arts are an incredibly important part of our society, I’d love to be able to say that ticket prices should stay artificially low,” said Mr. Sherman, who is also a United States theater columnist for the British weekly The Stage. “But that denies the reality of what commercial theater is. Shows have a responsibility to return money to the people who invested in them and to the people who created the show.”The Harvard economist N. Gregory Mankiw paid $2,500 apiece last fall for prime tickets to “Hamilton,” which he bought two weeks before the performance via StubHub. As he put it in a subsequent column in The Times, “In a perfect world, everyone would have the opportunity to see a megahit like ‘Hamilton.’”But “it was only because the price was so high that I was able to buy tickets at all on such short notice,” he added. “If legal restrictions or moral sanctions had forced prices to remain close to face value, it is likely that no tickets would have been available by the time my family got around to planning its trip to the city.”When I reached him this week, Mr. Mankiw said he thought the backlash to high theater prices reflected a broader anticapitalist bias. “People say they believe in capitalism, but when prices rise to clear markets, they say it’s unfair,” he said. “I have some sympathy for that when you’re talking about fundamental rights, like perhaps health care. But scarce tickets to ‘Hamilton’?”I asked him if “Hamilton” tickets had been worth the cost. “Every penny,” Mr. Mankiw said. “It was fantastic, one of the best things I’ve ever seen.”Just as smart travelers know how to find bargain airline seats, there are some simple ways ticket buyers can use dynamic pricing to their advantage, since it yields bargains along with premium prices. Weekday shows, and especially Wednesday matinees, are generally in far less demand than weekend shows. January and September are the best months for cheap seats. Prices are usually lower before a show officially opens and critics weigh in (as long as the reviews are positive).Waiting until the last minute often pays off for everything but the biggest hits, since lost revenue from an empty seat can never be recouped. Theaters often offer last-minute cut-rate tickets at the TKTS booths, and online resellers start to slash prices. (Ticket buyers can monitor in real time what’s available at the TKTS website.)And as I discovered, it helps to be flexible. While I started out this week looking for “Hello, Dolly!” tickets, I ended up at “Groundhog Day,” a new show with seven Tony nominations, including best musical and best actor, for a small fraction of the price of seeing Bette Midler. Seats for “Groundhog Day” were available at TKTS for half-price and online for $50. (And I loved it.)Dynamic pricing and super-premium prices may be relatively new, but the scarcity of tickets for hit shows has a long tradition. Mr. Schumacher cited “My Fair Lady,” the “Hamilton” of the 1955-56 Broadway season. As Broadway lore has it, a man in the audience turned to his neighbor, an older woman, and asked why the fifth-row center seat next to her was empty.“My husband died,” she replied.“Didn’t anyone else want to come?” he asked.“No,” she answered. “They’re all at the funeral.”"
Nordstrom to Explore Deal to Go Private as Retail Sector Reels,"In an industry reeling from bankruptcies, vacant storefronts and plummeting sales, Nordstrom is one of the few department store chains to show promise.The higher-end clothing retailer invested in its e-commerce business early on and was judicious about not opening too many new stores, avoiding many of the pitfalls that are driving other retailers to ruin.But even from a position of relative strength, Nordstrom is struggling to navigate a broad upending of the retail industry, as shopping malls lose their appeal and more customers choose to buy goods online.On Thursday, members of the family that founded Nordstrom in Seattle a century ago — and who still own a substantial portion of its shares — said they were exploring ways to shift the company into private ownership.The decision signals the Nordstrom family’s commitment to its core retail business at a time when investors and lenders are deserting the industry in droves.It also reflects optimism that a private equity firm or a sovereign wealth fund would be willing to invest in a large retailer, after many major investors got burned in debt-fueled buyouts that went bust.“Nordstrom is the best of the breed,” said David Shiffman, a managing director and a head of the retail group at Peter J. Solomon Company, an investment banking advisory firm. “This is not a laggard throwing in the towel.”Still, considering going private is an acknowledgment that the public stock market is not a friendly place for companies needing to make costly changes as they compete with online giants like Amazon.By making such a move, Nordstrom would duck the glare of public shareholders and the pressure to constantly produce short-term profits.“This is a clear signal that the changes that retailers need to make are much more extensive and expensive than public shareholders have the appetite for,” said Joel Bines, a managing director focused on retail at AlixPartners, an advisory firm.Traditional retailers are in a free fall, as physical stores fade as enjoyable, dynamic places to spend an afternoon. On Thursday, the Canadian company that owns Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor said it would cut 2,000 jobs.Department stores have tried to increase their focus on e-commerce, but many are still weighed down by costly real estate holdings they took on by moving into suburban malls across the United States during better times.How the retail industry evolves has big implications for the economy. The sector employs one in 10 Americans and occupies millions of square feet of commercial real estate.Nordstrom invested in online sales and marketing earlier than many of its peers, while proceeding carefully in opening new stores. The brand is also known for investing in customer service, as other retailers look to cut costs in unprofitable stores, said Christian Buss, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse.“They are a big exception,” Mr. Buss said.Shares in Nordstrom were up 10 percent on Thursday on the news that a move to private ownership was being considered, giving the company a market value of $7.5 billion.Nordstrom shares had fallen 2.8 percent in the 12 months before that announcement — far less than other department stores’ shares. But analysts complain that investors have lumped the company in with significantly troubled retailers, leaving its stock undervalued.That could be another motivation for finding a private partner.“The family is saying they have conviction in the business and see value far beyond where the street is willing to own the stock,” Mr. Shiffman said.Nordstrom was co-founded by the Swedish immigrant John W. Nordstrom, who had moved out West and, eventually, to Alaska in search of gold. He settled in Seattle, where he teamed up with a shoemaker, Carl F. Wallin. They opened their first store in 1901.Members of the Nordstrom family have had the retail business in their blood from the start, and their name has left an indelible mark on Seattle. A medical office tower in the city bears the Nordstrom name, as do lecture and recital halls at Seattle’s downtown art museum and symphony hall.In a city where fleece and T-shirts are more common among workers, employees at Nordstrom’s downtown headquarters stand out for their chic attire, which they are encouraged to buy using employee discounts from the company’s stores.Yet the Nordstroms’ civic profile has been overshadowed to some degree by the area’s newer business icons, including Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, whose company is expected to become the largest apparel retailer in the country this year.It seems unlikely that members of the Nordstrom family, who collectively own about 31 percent of the company’s shares, could buy out the other shareholders without an investment partner like a private equity firm or a large pension fund.The company carries just $2.7 billion in long-term debt, far less proportionally than rivals like Neiman Marcus. That leaves plenty of room for the Nordstroms and any backers they line up to add more debt as part of a going-private deal. The company could also borrow against its real estate to help finance a transaction.The family members exploring the buyout are actively involved in managing the company. They include the co-presidents, Blake W. Nordstrom, Peter E. Nordstrom, and Erik B. Nordstrom; the president of stores, James F. Nordstrom Jr.; the chairman emeritus, Bruce A. Nordstrom; and Anne E. Gittinger.A Nordstrom spokeswoman declined to comment.Founders of other companies have created partnerships with private equity firms in the past. Notable among them is Michael S. Dell, the technology billionaire who joined forces with Silver Lake to take his empire private for nearly $25 billion.Private equity firms have a long history in retail investing. Some have even successfully turned around struggling store chains. Sycamore Partners, for instance, has won plaudits and big profits for rebuilding Talbots, among others.Others have had a rougher time. TPG and Leonard Green teamed up with Millard S. Drexler, J. Crew’s chief executive, to take the onetime fashion darling private again for about $3 billion.But J. Crew has suffered through years of declining sales that prompted speculation that the highly indebted retailer would eventually file for bankruptcy. Mr. Drexler agreed to step down as chief executive this week.Other high-end department stores have not fared much better.Neiman Marcus, which has had two sets of private-equity owners in the past decade, planned to return to the public markets. But earlier this year, amid declining sales, it withdrew its plans to go public."
Surfing With a New Keyboard,"Q. What’s the point of using a keyboard that’s different from the one that came with the smartphone?A. While the virtual keyboard that came with your phone may be fine for typing and may include a few shortcuts to emoji characters, keyboard programs from other developers often include additional features. These can include support for “swipe typing” — in which you glide your finger from key to key on the screen to form words, instead of pecking at each key. Better predictive tools for suggesting words, buttons to insert images and animated GIFs, and other timesaving tools are typical features of many third-party keyboards.Several developers make their own keyboards for use with Android and iOS devices, so check your app store to see what is available. Google has its own keyboard app, called Gboard, for both Android and iOS. Gboard offers real-time translation into other languages as you type, emoji search, voice typing and a shortcut to Google Search among its tools; Google includes a privacy warning about its data collection, however.Microsoft makes an alternative keyboard of its own for iOS, too. The company’s Word Flow keyboard is designed for fast typing by tapping or gliding (including a layout that can be used easily with one hand). Customizable backgrounds are included in addition to other features.The Swype keyboard for Android, iOS and other platforms, and SwiftKey, also for Android and iOS, are other type-by-sliding apps, with strong predictive text algorithms and autocorrect functions. The colorful Fleksy keyboard supports extensions (like an app launcher and “rainbow keys” that pop up as you type), gestures and different onscreen layouts; like other popular keyboards, it is also available for Android and iOS phones and tablets as well as for Amazon’s tablets.When you find a keyboard app you would like to try, download and install the software on your device. Once the software is in place, go into the phone’s settings for keyboards and input methods and select the new app as the default. You may need to enable the app’s optional features as well.If certain apps default to the phone’s standard keyboard, that is most likely because those apps do not work with third-party keyboards. Depending on your phone, you may also find some third-party keyboards can freeze or feel slow, but you can always switch back to the phone’s original keyboard or find a different app."
"In Portland, a Rare Outpost for Die-Hard Saab Fans","PORTLAND, Ore. — It mounted the ignition on the center console next to the driver. It once tested replacing steering wheels with joysticks. Its earliest cars were available only in green. Saab, more than most automakers, took pride in making cars that were a little unusual.So it makes sense that one of the United States’ last Saab dealerships is in a city with the slogan “Keep Portland Weird.”The Swedish automaker filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and has not produced any new cars since, leaving a vanishingly small number of outposts for fans of the company’s quirky cars. Garry Small Saab, a family business based in Portland, Ore., is one of them — and it is chugging along just fine, thank you very much.“We sell a few Saabs. We work on a few Saabs. Servicing Saabs is going to keep us going for a very, very long time,” Garry Small said.It didn’t always look that way. Years of dwindling sales, compounded by an outdated lineup, took a toll on the carmaker. A Dutch supercar company, Spyker, tried to revive the Saab brand after buying it in 2010, but the audacious move did not work and production ended soon after.That left Saab dealers like Mr. Small stuck with cars that he said were “virtually unsellable,” as their warranties were worthless. “It was some tough times there, for a couple of years,” he said.Luckily for staunch Saab loyalists — and Mr. Small — parts are still readily available for everything except truly vintage models. That maintenance business, along with sales of used Saabs as well as several other late-model sedans and S.U.V.s from other brands, has kept the business going.For Saab enthusiasts — or “Saabistas” — stepping into Mr. Small’s showroom is like going back in time.Company memorabilia fills rows of shelves, Saab posters and signs cover the walls, and used Saab cars sit waiting for their next owner to take them home. Mr. Small even keeps an orange 1954 Saab 92 on the showroom floor. It doesn’t run, but he says it is one of only two such versions to remain in the United States, and functions as a conversation piece.The brand may have a reputation for quirkiness, but Mr. Small says its appeal is rooted in more basic characteristics. “They’re so well engineered, great to drive, the seats are comfortable and they’re great in snow,” he said.Saab was established in the run-up to World War II as a military manufacturer, shifting to making vehicles after the conclusion of the war.It quickly earned a reputation for doing things its own way — its origins were in aerospace and military, so its vehicles often reflected a radically different approach to car manufacturing.Saab’s first teardrop-shaped vehicle, the 92, used a small but peppy two-stroke engine, which required a combination of gasoline and oil to be fed into the combustion chambers. The company was also an early adopter of front-wheel drive, which helped cut costs and improved handling in poor weather. It also embraced turbocharging and employing aerodynamics to improve speed and fuel efficiency.Over the years, Saabs won a reputation for distinctive exteriors and engineering quirks, gaining the company a dedicated following around the world. The company’s sales in the United States peaked in 1986, at just above 48,000.Garry Small traces his relationship with Saab to that very year.By that time, he had been in the car business for nearly a quarter-century, working for Pacific Car Sales, a Portland dealership specializing in imported brands like Datsun (which would become Nissan), Triumph and Volvo. It even sold Amphicars, amphibious German vehicles capable of driving on both land and water.Mr. Small established his own dealership, initially catering exclusively to Volvos, in the early 1970s. The following decade, he bought another dealership and expanded to cover both Swedish brands. Over time, the Volvo side of his business tapered off in favor of Saabs.Over the years, Saab began to dominate his work, not to mention his automotive passion.When asked if he was drawn to one brand more than the other, he chuckled. “I’m more of a Saab guy now.”“I just feel that Saab engineering was much more advanced than Volvo,” Mr. Small said. “Because Saab was a front-wheel-drive car since forever, they just work better in the snow and ice.”His favorite Saab is the 2011 model year 9-5, and a steel-gray version powered by a turbocharged V-6 engine and fitted with all-wheel drive serves as his personal car.A New York Times review of the vehicle called the 9-5 “a car you want to love,” but also one that lagged rivals in terms of ride comfort and chassis refinement.Its understated lines have aged well, however, and one at Garry Small Saab caught the eye of Nanci Main, a recently retired restaurant owner in Ocean Park, Wash. She traveled three hours to test-drive a 2010 9-5 Aero sedan.“This is my fifth Saab and the Aero is my fanciest,” she wrote in a follow-up email. She bought the car and now plans to turn “Saab road-trip fantasies into reality.”“I am Swedish and love the Swedish qualities of Saab,” she said, describing it as “strong, powerful, safe, unique and classy.”Introduced in 2010, the 9-5 luxury sedan nevertheless proved to be Saab’s swan song.Despite the carmaker’s disappearance, the focus of Garry Small Saab very much remains on the brand. Mr. Small says many of his longtime customers, some of whose allegiance has drifted to German luxury brands, routinely tell him how much they miss the special character of a Saab.At any given moment, Mr. Small maintains an inventory of 15 to 20 used Saab vehicles — most are purchased locally, by word of mouth, thanks to his extensive experience and reputation in the world of Saab.“It keeps us really busy,” he said."
"Video Review: With New Ioniq, Hyundai Goes After Prius","It is the most efficient gasoline-powered car you can buy in America. There’s generous room for four, five if need be. It’s quiet, comfortable and comes with a lifetime battery warranty. And it is not the Toyota Prius.It’s the Hyundai Ioniq (rhymes with iconic) Hybrid.The King is dead. Long live the King.Yes, Hyundai has out-Priused the Prius with the Ioniq. Specifically, the Ioniq Hybrid Blue model (available in many other colors) averages 58 miles per gallon, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, two more than the Prius Eco. But Ioniq isn’t just a hybrid: There’s an all-electric model currently (no pun intended) exclusive to California and a plug-in hybrid version due later this year.I have driven the Electric and the base, at $23,035, Hybrid Blue. I’ll cut to the chase: These are exceptionally well-done vehicles that deserve to be on any fuel miser’s test-drive list. Buyers seem to be shunning ultraefficient cars for sport utility vehicles, but that’s another story.Ioniq is a hatchback with an aerodynamic silhouette dictated by Mother Nature. I see hints of a Saab 900 without the droopy back end. Inside and out, Ioniq avoids the riotous lines of the Prius. I parked next to one and asked a dozen people to vote on looks. Ioniq won unanimously. The interior is straightforward, with the gauge cluster in front of the steering wheel. Right where God intended it to be.I’ll focus mainly on the Hybrid model since it’s the volume seller. The working bits include a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder with 104 horsepower and 109 pound-feet of torque, paired with a 32-kilowatt electric motor that provides 43 horsepower and 125 pound-feet. In total, the front wheels have 139 horsepower to work with. The Hybrid’s transmission is a 6-speed dual clutch (most hybrids use a continuously variable unit). The lithium-ion polymer battery lives under the back seat.Taking about nine seconds to reach 60 miles an hour, Ioniq beats Prius by a second. The Hyundai is also quieter and feels more engaged in corners, though the low-rolling-resistance tires lack the bite needed for a truly fun dynamic. Ioniq has the same glass panel on the back of the trunk lid as Prius, but Toyota wins in the visibility department.The Ioniq Hybrid does the normal hybrid things. The engine shuts down at stoplights. Coasting and braking rejuvenate the battery. But because Ioniq has a conventional geared transmission, it feels as if you’re driving a normal gas-only car. No “rubber bandy” continuously variable transmission dynamic here.I was often in the less-efficient “sport” mode and got 55 miles per gallon. For comparison, I saw 52 m.p.g. in the Prius.The entry-level Blue lacks shiny trim that spiffs up the exterior. The interior looks clean but spartan. Nearly all base cars do. Spend an extra $1,750 for the SEL edition and you get spruced-up style as well as blind-spot warning and heated seats. It also drops average fuel economy by three miles per gallon. Go ahead. Splurge. You’re worth it.The back seat is spacious for two. If three adults can’t endure short trips, they’re either large or fussy. Hyundai claims the trunk is biggest in class. The liftgate and folding split seats allow Ioniq to gobble bicycles whole.The Electric model has no gears, just a fixed single-speed transmission like most electric cars. The electric motor produces 118 horsepower with 215 pound-feet of soul-satisfying torque. Steering wheel paddles adjust the amount of power regeneration to the battery. In its highest setting, there’s so much drag from the generator, the Ioniq Electric can often be driven without touching the brake pedal. Simply lift off the throttle and it slows down in a hurry.The Electric starts at $30,335 before tax credits, and Hyundai states that it travels 124 miles on a charge. Yes, Chevrolet’s Bolt EV goes nearly twice the distance but costs roughly $7,000 more. Batteries are expensive, and Ioniq’s lithium-ion polymer pack that’s tucked beneath the back seat and trunk floor is smaller than the Bolt’s. On 220 current, it fully charges in about 4 hours and 25 minutes. Ioniq’s standard Level 3 charging ability provides an 80 percent charge as quickly as 23 minutes. That feature is an extra $750 on the Bolt. Hyundai doesn’t recommend 110-volt charging.The Electric is quick off the line, hushed inside, and would be, uh, a gas to drive if not for its efficiency-minded tires. My short time with it kept me from verifying the 124-mile range. But in mid-50-degree temperatures, it appears that Hyundai is conservative with its number. Only you know if you need more than that kind of daily range. According to the E.P.A. the Electric is the most efficient car you can buy in the United States. Period.The coming Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid gets an estimated 27-mile all-electric range before it defaults to standard hybrid mode. That’s 189 miles a week if plugged in nightly, or 756 miles monthly and over 9,000 miles annually. In a practical sense, that eliminates most trips to the gas station.While Ioniq earns a spot in the automotive efficiency hall of fame, Prius remains the marketing champ. Prius is to hybrids as Kleenex is to tissue, and Hyundai would need clever marketing to vanquish Toyota’s deep advantage there. But it can be done. Hydrox, after all, was the original sandwich cookie and Oreo the upstart knockoff. Hyundai has solid products with the three Ioniq models. Any of them should make efficiency geeks happy, and keep competitors on their toes."
Why a Buyout Could Suit Nordstrom,"Nordstrom insiders have chosen a good time to consider taking the business out of the public eye.A modestly leveraged buyout of the department store chain – recently famous for dropping first daughter Ivanka Trump’s clothing line – looks doable with members of the eponymous family rolling over their stakes. The growing list of retailers struggling with debt should sound a note of caution, though.The shopkeeping sector’s troubles, including dwindling foot traffic in malls, have taken their toll, and before Thursday’s pop after news of the family’s take-private interest, shares of Nordstrom were down 16 percent this year. Still, the company is in better shape than Macy’s, for example, which is closing a raft of stores.Tough action to weather the downturn could be easier to put into effect without the quarterly earnings treadmill. And the weakened share price helps the numbers add up for the Nordstrom family and any partners they bring in.Suppose they offer a 30 percent premium to Wednesday’s closing price of $40.48 a share. That would value the existing equity at $8.7 billion. Add $2.1 billion of net debt, and the total buyout value would be $10.8 billion.A ratio of debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, of four times would be fairly restrained for a buyout. Assume that’s doable. Using the just over $1.6 billion consensus estimate from Thomas Reuters Eikon for Ebitda in the financial year to next January, debt could cover $6.5 billion of the deal price.That leaves $4.3 billion of needed equity. But with family members owning more than 30 percent of Nordstrom’s stock at present, rolling over their stakes at the buyout price would account for more than 60 percent of that, Reuters Breakingviews calculates.They would need about $1.6 billion of additional cash, a manageable check for a private equity partner to write provided the family’s plans for the company over the coming years look lucrative enough.Though a leveraged deal is feasible, the Nordstroms need to play it carefully. Many retailers, including J. Crew and Neiman Marcus, are running into financial difficulties after years of private equity ownership and burdensome borrowing that have stripped them of cash reserves and operational flexibility. An aggressively tailored structure would be risky. That aside, though, Nordstrom could be well suited for a buyout."
"Matt Zames to Leave JPMorgan Chase, Seeking to Run His Own Business","Matt Zames, the tough-minded chief operating officer of the banking colossus JPMorgan Chase, is unexpectedly resigning.His departure was disclosed on Thursday in an internal memo from Jamie Dimon, the bank’s chief executive, who spoke admiringly of Mr. Zames’s career.Mr. Zames, Mr. Dimon wrote, “recently informed me of his decision to leave our firm following 13 years of outstanding service.” He has worked “tirelessly across many disciplines to help make us a better company,” Mr. Dimon added.In an interview on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Zames, 46, said he was leaving over a desire to run his own business, either at a financial company or perhaps in a role that combined finance and technology.“I have been in this business almost 25 years,” he said. “I spent the vast majority of my time running businesses, driving things forward, facing off against clients, taking business risk.”“But at its core, look: I’ll be 47 in October,” he added. “I want to get back to running the railroad — running my railroad, running my business. So it’s just a natural point.”His exit is sure to rekindle speculation about who will succeed Mr. Dimon, who at 61 is in his 11th year as chief executive of the large international bank and has shown little interest in leaving.In the wake of the 2012 “London whale” trading loss of $6 billion, a series of executives left the bank, including James E. Staley, Michael J. Cavanagh and Frank J. Bisignano, who at various points were seen as possible heirs apparent.More recently, the focus has shifted to up-and-comers like Marianne Lake, the bank’s chief financial officer, as well as on established players like Gordon Smith, its chief executive of consumer and community banking, and Daniel Pinto, who runs the corporate and investment bank.Shares of JPMorgan rose 1.24 percent on Thursday.Mr. Zames, who had also been regarded as a potential candidate to be chief executive, said on Thursday that a feeling that he would not obtain that job was not a motivating factor in his decision to leave.The executive has long been associated with crisis management. Mr. Zames worked as a junior trader at Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that had to be rescued in 1998, before playing a leading role in JPMorgan’s emergency takeover of Bear Stearns in 2008.He later recalled walking in to Bear’s Madison Avenue office tower late one evening in March 2008. Bear’s officers had realized that a series of client cash withdrawals had rendered their company insolvent, and Mr. Zames summed up the situation with some characteristically blue language, saying the “whole thing” was headed in a very bad direction. That office building, one of the most valuable assets sold to JPMorgan in its hasty purchase of Bear, was where Mr. Zames later worked.He did his share of troubleshooting at JPMorgan, too. In the London whale episode, Mr. Zames helped unwind some exotic trades that had created billions of dollars in losses for the bank. He then took over the role of chief investment officer in 2012, reshaping the department that had made the risky transactions and marred JPMorgan’s reputation.At the time, Mr. Dimon praised Mr. Zames as a “world-class risk manager.”Mr. Zames, a father of three who kept a low public profile, is unvarnished in more private settings. He is known both on Wall Street and in Washington, where he was chairman of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, a panel of investors that counsels the agency on the economy and on technical government-debt issues. Shortly before leaving that panel last year, Mr. Zames wrote a letter to Jacob J. Lew, then the Treasury secretary, warning that future debt-limit fights in Congress could lead to “another catastrophic financial crisis.”Mr. Zames counted some of the most senior hedge fund managers as both clients and personal friends, and was known for giving tough advice, even to competitors.Kenneth C. Griffin, founder of the Chicago money-management firm Citadel, said that he had been impressed with Mr. Zames since meeting him as a student at M.I.T., 25 years ago.“Matt’s profound impact on JPMorgan reflects the combination of brilliance I saw in him then, and the leadership skills he has developed as he’s taken on challenge after challenge over the years,” Mr. Griffin said in an email.His happiest years at JPMorgan were probably spent running its multi-thousand-person fixed-income business, walking the trading floors of the former Bear building. There he studied markets ranging from interest rates to currencies and mortgage bonds, looking for moments when traders seemed to be reaching consensus on the market’s direction. At those times, he believed, prices were often on the verge of turning unexpectedly.He often called his bond shop the “Walmart” of trading because of its heavy and lucrative flow of buy and sell orders from clients around the world. At one point, he set up a trading floor office for the head of the investment bank at the time, Mr. Staley, now chief executive of Barclays of Britain, to give him more direct exposure to the market’s dynamics.“My philosophy has always been if you can create a flood of volume through your pipes, you’re meaningfully reducing your risk,” Mr. Zames said on Thursday. “And your business will trade at a higher multiple if you do it.”Under terms of an agreement with JPMorgan filed Thursday, Mr. Zames can collect more than $10 million in compensation in the coming two years if he avoids joining a competing company until February of 2018, among other requirements."
"In Comey’s Testimony, Some See Parallels to Sexual Harassment Victims","For some people who watched James B. Comey’s Senate testimony on Thursday, the questions that Mr. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, faced and the situations he described brought to mind a seemingly unrelated topic: sexual harassment.As members of the Senate Intelligence Committee questioned Mr. Comey, sometimes sharply, asking why he did not immediately report any behavior by President Trump that he thought was inappropriate, why he did not quit as F.B.I. director and why he continued to take private calls from Mr. Trump even after he was unnerved by their one-on-one interactions, commentators on social media made comparisons to the difficulties and doubts faced by women who have been sexually harassed or abused.Emily Nussbaum, The New Yorker’s television critic, said that the situation reminded her of the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News that led to the ouster of Roger Ailes, the network’s former chairman, and Bill O’Reilly, the former Fox News host.And for some who were watching, the testimony underscored how sexual harassment is more about power than sex.Not all of whose who watched Mr. Comey testify were comfortable with the comparison, saying that it trivialized victims of harassment and abuse."
U.K. Election Delivers New Variable for Uncertain Global Economy,"LONDON — In a global economy amply stocked with anxiety-provoking variables, Britain just added another.An election designed to bolster the government’s mandate instead yielded fundamental confusion over who is in charge as the nation prepares for fraught negotiations in its pending divorce from the European Union.Prime Minister Theresa May had called the election on the assumption that her Conservative Party would emerge stronger, solidifying her negotiating position. Instead, the electorate’s stunning rebuke of her leadership has left her relying on the support of a small, socially conservative right-wing party in Northern Ireland in order to form a government, intensifying uncertainty about future commercial dealings across the English Channel.Investors took the latest turmoil in Britain as a prompt to unload the British pound. As European markets began trading on Friday, the currency slipped as much as 2 percent against the dollar. The country’s benchmark stock index, however, gained around 1 percent. Analysts said that rise occurred because many of the companies that make up the index do a majority of their business overseas and therefore benefit from a cheaper pound.And yet the shocking electoral outcome also has the potential to diminish the looming economic costs of Britain’s exit from the European Union, commonly known as Brexit.It enhanced the possibility that a chastened government led by Mrs. May would now strike a less confrontational approach with Europe while seeking a way to keep Britain within the bloc’s large single marketplace.As Britain prepared for its face-off with Europe, the prime minister had been adamant that her country would impose strict limits on immigration, a posture seemingly enhanced by recent  terrorist attacks. Yet limiting immigration appeared certain to cost Britain inclusion in the European single market, a swath of the globe stretching from Ireland to Greece and holding some 500 million relatively affluent consumers.The European authorities have consistently emphasized that Britain’s continued inclusion in the single market requires that it abide by the bloc’s rules — not least, a provision that people be allowed to move freely within its confines.In the parlance of the moment, Britain appeared destined for a so-called hard Brexit, in which it would sever itself from the single marketplace, raising the prospect that tariffs could ultimately constrain trade across the English Channel.This redrawing of the basic geography of European commerce was playing out just as President Trump was disavowing regional trade deals across the Atlantic and Pacific, while variously threatening trade hostilities with Canada, China, Germany and Mexico.This election could change that trajectory.It is unclear how long Mrs. May’s government will hold together — even with the support of the Democratic Unionist Party from Northern Ireland, it retains a narrow majority in parliament. But the unexpected new political configuration might compel Britain to relinquish its pursuit of immigration limits in an effort to keep itself within the single market.In short, the election has complicated the assumption that Britain is headed irretrievably toward the exits, producing a moment in which seemingly everything may be up for reconsideration.Those who have favored Britain remaining within Europe, or at least softening the terms of its exit, now have “an expectation, or at least a hope, that cooler heads will prevail,” said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, a company based in London that manages foreign exchange transactions. “It may be that hard Brexit has been rejected by the electorate.”And yet, perhaps counterintuitively, the election also appeared to increase the possibility of an unruly Brexit in which Britain crashes out of the European Union absent a deal governing future interaction.Mrs. May formally initiated the proceedings in March, setting the clock ticking on a two-year negotiating window in which Britain and Europe must settle financial terms and strike an agreement on trade. That was always going to be complicated, subject to the influence of domestic politics in the other 27 members of the European Union.Now, such talks are to unfold in an atmosphere in which she must tame an unruly party whose fiercest advocates for Brexit may be emboldened by her narrow majority, with the prospect of still another election later this year. All of which heightens the possibility that the two-year clock may expire without a deal, a scenario known in Brexit vernacular as going over the cliff edge. As the metaphor implies, it could get ugly.Britain now sends nearly half its exports to the European Union, a flow of goods that would be impeded by its departure from the single market.London’s future as a dominant global financial center would be imperiled. Global banks have established regional headquarters in the city, relying on so-called passports that allow them to serve clients across Europe as if the bloc were one country, with a single set of regulators. If Britain abandons Europe without a deal, the banks would have to satisfy regulators in multiple countries. Many of the transactions they now handle in London for European clients would be effectively illegal.Worries about the economic impact of Brexit have been weighing heavily on the pound, which plunged after the referendum last June that unleashed Brexit. With Britain at risk of suffering barriers to trade, it has lost some of its considerable luster as a place for companies to invest, making its money a less desirable currency to hold.A weakened pound has, in turn, translated into rising prices in Britain — on food, gasoline and imported components used by domestic factories. All of this has reinforced concerns about the fate of the economy.The scene in Britain has played out just as other sources of uncertainty have been gnawing at the global economy.Beyond his bellicose threats of confrontation on trade, President Trump revoked American participation in the multinational accord struck in Paris to combat climate change, heightening a sense that a global order long shaped by American engagement is now fundamentally uncertain.Perpetual existential threats to the euro, the currency shared by 19 European countries, were eased last month by the election in France, which saw the defeat of Marine Le Pen, who had threatened to pull her nation out of the common currency area. But elections to be held in Italy this year or early next year may elevate the Five Star Movement, which has been gaining strength in part because of talk of scrapping the euro.Add to the list of variables the fact that Britain — with the world’s fifth-largest economy — is scheduled to sit down with European leaders to haggle over Brexit just days after its leadership suffered a major setback at the polls.The decisive question is whether this latest wave of uncertainty marks a step back from Brexit, one that could restore a sense of calm, or whether it means more chaos at a time when the world craves capable leadership.“The outlook for Brexit is now very unclear,” Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy, said as the sun rose over London. “The odds of a softer Brexit have increased as a result of the outcome last night. At the same time, it also does increase the odds of a cliff-edge Brexit.”"

The next time you seek financial advice, those professionals will be required to act in a way that approximates the patient-doctor relationship. But many investors will still remain vulnerable.The fiduciary rule — which was created under the Obama administration and has, for now, survived efforts to quash it — takes partial effect on Friday. That means all types of financial advisers, including brokers and insurance agents, must put their customers’ interests ahead of their own financial motives, at least when handling customers’ retirement accounts.While the new rule strengthens consumer protections, there are large gaps in what it actually covers. And nothing in the rule requires professionals who call themselves wealth managers or financial advisers to advertise the fact that they may only be licensed to sell a product — and have little training or education in genuine financial planning.The rule as written also continues to be challenged. House Republicans approved a bill on Thursday to eliminate it, though that bill faces trouble in the Senate. And it is being reviewed by the new leadership at the Department of Labor, which oversees retirement accounts. The fiduciary rule could still change, or be weakened, before it takes full effect in January.In the meantime, here are some things consumers need to know when shopping for financial advice and investments.The basic obligations of the rule are in effect, which means brokers and advisers must meet a “professional standard of care,” and they must put customers first.The rule covers most retirement accounts, including individual retirement accounts and workplace accounts like 401(k) and some 403(b) plans. Advisers making recommendations on those accounts, and on rollovers from workplace plans into I.R.A.s, are required to charge reasonable fees, and they are not permitted to make misleading statements about investment transactions, their compensation or any conflicts of interest.But many accounts, including 403(b) accounts for government workers like teachers and church-related plans, are not covered and are still subject to ill-advised and high-cost investments. A plain brokerage account packed with mutual funds or a 529 plan, for instance, would not be covered either.The old rules still apply there: Brokers are only required to recommend “suitable” investments, which means the product can make the adviser more money at the customer’s expense, even if there is an option that performs identically but is less expensive.Advisers may recommend new or different types of mutual funds or annuities that are better for investors. For instance, new classes of mutual fund shares — including “clean shares,” which charge management fees but not distribution fees — were created in response to the rule, according to the Consumer Federation of America. Some annuities have been cleaned up, the group said, offering lower fees and shorter surrender periods — the amount of time before the funds can be withdrawn without penalties.Critics of the rule have said that putting customers first will be too expensive, and financial advisers may need to drop smaller accounts. If that happens, “take a moment to count your lucky stars,” said Barbara Roper, a consumer advocate with the federation who has been tracking the fiduciary issue for decades. “A firm that will only advise you if it can profit unfairly at your expense is not where you want to keep you money.”The fiduciary standard will not be legally enforceable on I.R.A.s until next year, when financial professionals with conflicts of interest will generally be required to sign a contract with customers. That contract could require the I.R.A. investor to settle any claims in arbitration, but it must give investors the right to bring a class-action claim in court.But if an adviser recommends rolling money from, say, a workplace retirement plan into an I.R.A. and a consumer believes the adviser had a conflict of interest, the consumer could pursue legal action now. The Department of Labor has indicated, however, that it will bring enforcement actions only when it does not see a good-faith effort to comply with the new rule.You might ask the adviser to sign a fiduciary pledge, something we published several years ago after a certified financial planner circulated the oath in an email:Such a pledge is likely to bolster your case in court or arbitration, legal specialists said.Since then, The Committee for the Fiduciary Standard, an advocacy group, suggested asking advisers to sign an oath of its own, which can be found on its website.The adviser’s reaction to any pledge will be a good indicator of how he or she operates and whether he or she is the type of adviser who always acts as a fiduciary, with all of your money, no matter the type of account. Going through this exercise “will raise awareness,” said Tamar Frankel, a professor at Boston University School of Law who reviewed the pledge. And, she added, it could help change the culture.The rule applies largely to new advice and investment recommendations. So it may be wise to have an adviser review your situation to see if it can be improved — or to see if you’re paying too much. For example, if an adviser recommends continuing to invest in an expensive mutual fund that you’ve been contributing to each month, the new standard would apply, explained Micah Hauptman of the Consumer Federation. That means the recommendation must be in your best interest, and the adviser could not make any misleading statements and or charge more than “reasonable compensation.”But if an investor simply continues to buy that same mutual fund based on an old recommendation, the adviser would only need to ensure that the investor is being charged reasonable compensation in the future, he explained.There are too many questions to list here, but some of the most pertinent involve compensation: How much are you being paid, and by whom? Do you plan to make any changes in our relationship in light of the new rules? For a thorough list of 21 questions to ask advisers, read Ron Lieber’s column on the topic.All advisers generally have some sort of conflict of interest. But choosing advisers who do not make money based on the sale of a product and are instead compensated for their time, similar to how lawyers are paid, eliminates some of the more glaring problems. Other professionals charge flat fees or a percentage of the assets they manage.You can find such advisers through the Garrett Planning Network, the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, and XY Planning Network.Some firms have decided to stop charging commissions on investments and to move customers to accounts where investors pay a fee for advice. Investors will need to evaluate whether the new cost structure makes sense for them."
"A Leaker’s Admission: How the Media Covered, and Factored Into, Comey’s Testimony","President Trump, Russia, White House meetings and questions of executive power were all front and center at James B. Comey’s hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday.But another theme also emerged: Mr. Comey’s interplay with the news media.With startling candor, Mr. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, described how he engineered the leak of his own memo, which detailed a private conversation with Mr. Trump. He also challenged a report about Russia that ran in The New York Times.And in one memorable moment, he compared a throng of reporters gathered at his driveway to “sea gulls at the beach,” prompting laughter in the chamber.Mr. Comey’s acknowledgment of his role as a leaker, although just one of several revelations that emerged from the testimony, dominated the early news coverage of his testimony, with The Washington Post calling it a “remarkable admission” and Bret Baier, the Fox News anchor, declaring “the media” as one of the losers of the day.Mr. Comey testified that he hoped that the information would lead to the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.Trump-friendly news organizations seized on the detail, wielding it as a cudgel against Mr. Comey and focusing on his leaking while playing down other developments from the hearing, like his assertions that the president had lied. Breitbart News described Mr. Comey as “implicating himself as an anti-Trump leaker” and a red headline on its home page screamed “Shock: Fmr FBI Director Admits Orchestrating Leak.”The right was not alone in focusing on the acknowledgment. Shortly after the hearing ended, The Huffington Post ran with the lead headline “Comey: I Leaked to Get a Special Prosecutor.”In his rebuttal to Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, attacked Mr. Comey’s admission as a betrayal of his official duties and a sign of his intent to embarrass the president. Mr. Comey, in his testimony, noted that the memo was not classified and that he was no longer a government employee when he leaked it.It is highly unusual in Washington circles for powerful officials to admit to being the source of a leak. But the reality, veteran journalists say, is that such leaks are a day-to-day occurrence — perhaps even more so during the Trump administration, as revelatory details about the White House have led to a series of blockbuster stories over the last several months.In blunt, almost matter-of-fact fashion, Mr. Comey described how he had written a memo about a one-on-one meeting with the president and given it to a friend, a professor at Columbia Law School, with the express purpose of having it passed on to a journalist. The Times reported on the memo last month.The Times also drew scrutiny as a result of another of Mr. Comey’s statements: He challenged the veracity of an article that described links between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russian intelligence.“In the main, it was not true,” Mr. Comey said of the article, but he did not specify what he thought was wrong with it. In a statement, a spokeswoman for The Times said the paper had “found no evidence that any prior reporting was inaccurate.” The Times published an article on Thursday discussing its reporting.News organizations friendly to Mr. Trump, who often attacks The Times, found fresh material in Mr. Comey’s assertion.Breitbart News, in its reporting on the comment, evoked a frequent presidential phrase: “fake news.”Mr. Comey’s testimony was carried live on numerous broadcast and cable networks, and anchors on multiple networks expressed their astonishment at the political developments on Thursday. On NBC, Savannah Guthrie described the remarkable scene of a former F.B.I. director “calling the sitting president a liar, on more than one occasion.” Chuck Todd said that leading Democrats were “looking for a smoking gun and didn’t get it.”Many commentators noted that Mr. Comey had stopped short of accusing the president of obstructing justice. Fox News’s anchors, immediately after the testimony, offered a mixed analysis. Dana Perino, a former aide to President George W. Bush, said, “If the Democrats were going to be thinking this is going to be a home run for them today, they got a surprise.”Chris Wallace, the host of “Fox News Sunday,” noted that “there were different audiences” watching Mr. Comey.“If I were Donald Trump’s lawyer, I would be pretty happy,” Mr. Wallace said on-air. But he added, “Politically, I thought it was very damaging to the president,” and noted that Mr. Comey had explicitly called the president a liar.“It’s not good stuff to have been said on national television,” Mr. Wallace said.Observers of the news media kept close track of the headlines, known in the television news industry as chyrons, that flash onscreen as a kind of instant analysis of the hearing. When Mr. Comey concluded his public remarks, around 12:30 p.m., the final chyrons encapsulated a familiar divide.CNN’s banner read: “Comey: Trump Admin Lied About Me & F.B.I.” On Fox News, the message was different: “Comey: Not for Me to Say If Trump Obstructed.”"
Movers: Tech Stocks Fall Sharply,"Technology stocks stumbled on Friday, dragging down the Nasdaq composite index.Amazon fell 3.2 percent, Facebook dropped 3.3 percent, Apple fell 3.9 percent, Netflix ended down 4.7 percent, while Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slid 3.4 percent.Earlier this week, some investors were anxious that these stocks had risen far faster than the major market indexes.“It is a rotation today and it is out of tech into some of the other sectors,” Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey, told Reuters.• Britain’s election has resulted in a hung Parliament, with no single party retaining an overall majority. With negotiations underway to determine who will lead the next government, the pound has dropped sharply amid the uncertainty.• Don’t forget to read the DealBook Morning Agenda.L’Oréal, the French cosmetics and luxury goods company, said on Friday that it had entered into exclusive talks to sell The Body Shop retail chain to Natura Cosméticos of Brazil.The potential transaction would value The Body Shop at 1 billion euros, or about $1.1 billion.The decision to sell the business followed an “extensive review” of strategic options for The Body Shop, which L’Oréal acquired in 2006, L’Oréal said.The Body Shop was founded in 1976 in Britain and operates in more than 60 countries. It reported retail sales of €1.5 billion in 2016.The transaction would be subject to regulatory approval and would be expected to close later this year.Shares of L’Oréal were up less than 1 percent in trading in Paris on Thursday morning. — CHAD BRAY"
Checking a Digital Photo’s Dimensions,"Q. Where do I find the dimensions of a digital photo on my computer? Amazon’s photofinishing service says the pictures need a resolution of “450 by 630” for a five-by-seven-inch print.A. Even if you do not have a photo-editing program that displays the picture’s resolution and other information, you can quickly see the width and height (measured in pixels) of a selected photo with the computer’s operating system. On a Windows PC, for example, hovering the mouse over an image thumbnail should display the photo’s dimensions in the pop-up Info Tip box. On a Mac, the information is displayed under a preview of the picture when you click on the file in the Finder’s “column view,” which you can select from the View menu in the Finder.The photo’s pixel dimensions and other embedded data — like the file format and size, exposure setting, and type of camera used to take it — can be seen in the picture’s Properties or Info box. On a PC, right-click on the file, select Properties from the menu and click on the Details tab in the Properties box. On a Mac, right-click (or hold down the Control key and click) the image thumbnail and choose Get Info.Photo-processing sites list minimum pixel dimensions and other requirements for the pictures you upload so that the finished prints are as sharp and clear as possible. Digital images that are too small will look blurry and jagged on paper, so be sure your files meet the site’s guidelines. If possible, it is best to use photos that have been imported from the camera, as pictures that were emailed or downloaded from sharing sites may have been converted to a lower resolution to reduce the file size.Amazon’s Photo Quality Tips page has a list of optimal photo resolutions based on the print size or project you want to produce from your digital images, as does Shutterfly and other photo-printing sites. For further reading on the topic, the online Adobe Photoshop User Guide has a detailed explanation of pixel dimensions and printed image resolution, and the Digital Photography School site has a tutorial of its own."
"Tech Roundup: The End of Yahoo, the Problem No Executive Could Fix","Next week, the long-struggling business known as Yahoo will finally become part of Verizon, combining its resources with Verizon-owned AOL, another internet pioneer that lost its way. Not surprisingly, about 2,100 people are expected to lose their jobs. That’s about 15 percent of the combined work force, Vindu Goel writes.It is, in the end, a quiet conclusion to years of drama. The joke often made in tech circles is that Yahoo is where good executive reputations go to die. There is some truth to that.Yahoo turned out to be a management Waterloo for Terry S. Semel, a successful entertainment boss who tried to enhance Yahoo content. He was followed by Jerry Yang, the Yahoo co-founder who had the prescience to invest in the Chinese internet company Alibaba — a large financial boon over time — but otherwise did not do much to fix the company.There was Carol Bartz, a widely respected software executive who could not figure out how to turn things around. Yahoo was also briefly run by Scott Thompson, who was forced out after a résumé scandal.And let’s not forget Marissa Mayer, the admired Google executive who took over Yahoo’s corner office and in five years did not have much more to show than her predecessors. She is the one who gets to turn off the lights.Yahoo’s share price rose by $5.16 after shareholders officially approved the Verizon deal Thursday, to close at $55.71 a share. Based on the increase, Ms. Mayer will depart with $264 million for her five years of work at Yahoo, up from $239 million last Friday."
Want to Buy a Home? Beware: It’s a Seller’s Market,"A tight supply of houses for sale, along with rising prices and worries about higher mortgage rates, is making buying a home a challenge in some areas this season.Because of a lack of inventory of homes in some markets, there is often a rush of offers when properties do become available, said Javier Vivas, manager of economic research at Realtor.com, a listing website. “Buyers,” he said, “should expect heavy competition.”The median sale price for previously owned homes in April nationally, according to the National Association of Realtors, was $244,800, up 6 percent from a year earlier.“Demand is easily outstripping supply in most of the country, and it’s stymieing many prospective buyers from finding a home to purchase,” Lawrence Yun, an economist for the Realtors association, said in a statement about the housing market.An improved economy has stimulated demand for housing, but the supply of homes for sale has lagged, making it harder for shoppers to find affordable properties, said Daren Blomquist, a senior vice president with Attom Data Solutions, which tracks property trends.One factor in the tight supply, Mr. Blomquist said, is that people are holding onto their homes longer than they once did. Investors who bought homes during the recession are earning rental income and are not in a rush to sell, while some owners still cannot sell because they remain underwater on their mortgages — meaning they owe more than the homes are worth. The average home seller these days has owned the house for about eight years, he said, compared with about four years before the recession.Another factor, according to Attom’s data: fewer foreclosures. Nearly 10 years after the financial crisis, foreclosures are at prerecession levels in many areas, reducing another source of homes for sale.All that means that competition is fierce in some markets, especially for lower- and midpriced homes, and home shoppers must be nimble. Lynn Johnson, a broker with Bamboo Realty in bustling Raleigh, N.C., said buyers must understand that they do not have days to mull an offer. “They have to be ready to pull the trigger if they find the right house,” she said.Buyers must also be prepared to put more cash down when they place a property under contract, she said. In the past, Ms. Johnson said, shoppers could expect to put down $500 as a “due diligence” deposit to the seller, which they would expect to lose if they found a house they liked better and walked away from a purchase contract. But now, sellers may demand deposits of $1,000, and sometimes as much as $2,500.In Denver, where the inventory of homes has been low for the past couple of years, “There is no such thing as lowballing,” said Stacie Staub, founder of West and Main Homes in Lakewood, Colo., near Denver. Often, she said, homes go on the market on a Friday and are under contract by Sunday.The market is so tight that Ms. Staub often recommends that people looking to trade up to a new home should first sell their own house, and then go shopping with cash. Sellers generally frown on “contingency” offers, which are subject to the sale of an existing home. When sellers are receiving multiple offers, they’ll choose all-cash bids over contingency offers, she said: “If you can’t pay cash, it’s harder to get your offer accepted.”Buyers are often so eager that sellers can negotiate a two-month “rent back,” she said, so they can live in their home — often rent-free — while shopping for a new one, Ms. Staub said.Even markets that had not been so cutthroat are starting to shift. The area in and around Fayetteville, N.C., had been “medium warm” earlier in the spring, but activity has heated up, said Rosemary Buerger, an agent with Coldwell Banker Advantage in Cameron, north of Fort Bragg. A lack of new construction has helped to tighten inventories, she said. “We’re in more of a seller’s market now,” she said.Here are some questions and answers about the current home-buying market:How should I approach house shopping in a tight market?Ms. Johnson advises clients to write out a list of “needs,” or must-haves, and wants, to streamline their house-hunting efforts. “Do you have to have four bedrooms?” she said. “Then why look at a three-bedroom? You cannot waste time.”Brokers say shoppers should expect that sellers will receive multiple offers. This means that if you find a house you like, you should make your best offer right away. Many shoppers want to offer the list price or below, but in a seller’s market that may put you at a disadvantage, Ms. Johnson said; in Raleigh, homes often sell for more than the list price.What should I expect will come with the house?In calmer markets, buyers typically expected to get major appliances like refrigerators, washers and dryers — perhaps even that riding lawn mower sitting in the garage — with the purchase of the home. Not so in a seller’s market, Ms. Johnson warned. “You are getting the house,” she said. Appliances, and usually closing costs, are most likely on you, she said.What are mortgage rates doing?Rates are still low by historical standards, reducing some of the pressure from rising home prices. They’re up compared with a year ago, but they dipped a bit on Thursday, according to the weekly report from Freddie Mac. Rates on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.89 percent, down from 3.94 percent last week. (A year ago, the average was 3.6 percent.)"
Why I Am Giving My Children Their Inheritance Now,"I have worked for a man who owns his-and-her 747s. Another former employer has a 10,000-acre hobby farm he visits about 10 times a year. And, in a total coincidence, I have been hired by two people who each happen to own one of the 25 largest yachts in the world, boats that come with 12 times the living space of my house and are equipped not only with fully stocked wine cellars but also with helicopters and submarines.So I know what wealthy is. And I know my wife and I are not.However, my wife’s consulting business is recognized nationally in her part of the universe, and every 10 years or so I write a book that sells a few copies, so we are doing O.K. No, we haven’t ever chartered a private jet, ordered a $1,000 bottle of wine at a restaurant or bought a $10,000 watch. But we did manage (barely) to put our four children through the (very expensive) colleges of their choice.After we had paid boatloads of tuition for 11 years, a funny thing happened: When the baby — all 6 feet 2 inches and 175 pounds of him — graduated, we relearned the meaning of discretionary income.We now have a little bit of extra income. And because we are hopelessly middle class, there isn’t anything outlandishly expensive that we want to spend it on. For example, we would feel uncomfortable taking a three-month vacation, even if my wife could get away. And we like the cars we have just fine and don’t feel compelled to upgrade to something that would cost 80 times more, although Alison does drool every time — twice so far — she sees a McLaren P1 LM on the street (sticker price: $4 million).So we have made a decision that gets some people to look at us strangely.We have started to give our children some of our money.We are not setting up substantial trust funds. Heck, we are not even fully taking advantage of the tax code that says I could give each kid $14,000 a year, and Alison could, too, so that we could end up gifting each of our four children $28,000 a year with no tax consequences to either us or them.We are not even averaging half of that. But for the last four years, right around the holidays, we have given them checks — along with traditional presents. So far the total allotted in aggregate to the four of them adds up to about three years of higher education at a good private college.They have each parked the money in low-cost, diversified index funds.Why would we ever give them our money? A couple of friends asked this question in horror — figuring we could use the funds, or it would be better to wait until after my wife and I die.My answer is threefold.THEY CAN USE THE MONEY NOW. Our oldest child, who recently bought a house in suburban San Francisco, paid more for his home than I did for any of mine. And the mortgage that he and his wife have on their charming (read: small) house could choke a horse, as my mother used to say. Oh, and by the way: They are saving so that the world’s cutest and smartest grandchild — now 23 months old — can go to college. Grandchild No. 2 is scheduled to arrive in October.Child No. 2 and his wife are house hunting. Child No. 3 and her fiancé soon will be. And Child No. 4, the aforementioned rather tall baby, is planning on starting a restaurant. They have legitimate uses for the money — now.THEY ARE GOING TO GET THE MONEY ANYWAY, IN THE FORM OF AN INHERITANCE. But hopefully that won’t be for a while — and as you saw in Point 1, if they had the money today, their lives would be easier. AND FINALLY: Why, as a parent, would you want your children — even if it is on some tiny, tiny, tiny subconscious level — waiting around for you to die, so they can inherit money they could use now?Our friends listen to all this, and sometimes they have questions like, “Aren’t you concerned you are giving them money you may need someday?”Not really. While neither Ali nor I own a working crystal ball, we have prepared the best we can for the future. We have saved — and continue to save — aggressively for retirement, and we have really good health insurance.The other common question is whether we’re worried about what our kids might do with the money.That answer is a flat no.For one thing, it is not all that much. Each of the children makes more — in some cases, a lot more — in a year than they have gotten in total.For another, they are pretty levelheaded young people. If they are going to make bad choices, they are going to make them no matter when they get the funds. (When we started doing this, the baby was 23.)While I find my friends’ reactions intriguing, I found our children’s reactions fascinating — and totally in character for each of them.Child No. 1, a finance/logistics guy for a San Francisco start-up, cited the longstanding “time value of money” concept, which states that the value of money right now is greater than it will be in the future because of the earning power it has today.“Oh,” he said. “You are giving us part of our inheritance now. Time value of money, and all that. Cool. Your grandson thanks you for helping to pay his college tuition.”Child No. 2, who has always been a bit of hoarder, said “thanks” — and instantly deposited it in his mutual fund.Child No. 3, who has never cared about money, tried to persuade us to spend it on ourselves. She took the check reluctantly — and with the strong understanding of just how much it is going to cost her and her soon-to-be husband to buy a house in or near Boston.Child No. 4, the budding restaurateur, said, “Thanks, guys!” and went back to planning his potential menu.I will not waste a minute worrying about how they are going to spend the money. And I am glad we gave it to them."
A Departure at JPMorgan Leaves Succession Planning Unclear,"Who will take over from Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, has just become a mystery-horse race. Mr. Dimon is losing his leading successor candidate, Matt Zames, the chief operating officer. Granted, the bank’s division heads are all more than capable executives, but age or inexperience probably means they would be interim C.E.O.s at best.Mr. Zames is both young and well traveled. Now 46, he was head of fixed-income trading before Mr. Dimon in 2012 asked him to clean up the mess left when the bank’s chief investment office lost $6 billion in the infamous “London whale” fiasco. His duties as chief operating officer then grew.He wants, though, to go back to running a business, he told The New York Times on Thursday — possibly in financial technology. Mr. Zames is the latest top executive to leave the bank in recent years as Mr. Dimon, 61, extends his now 11½-year reign at the top.The former investment banking bosses James E. Staley and William T. Winters now run Barclays and Standard Chartered, respectively. Frank J. Bisignano, Mr. Zames’s co-chief operating officer for a time, now heads First Data, while the onetime retail chief Charles W. Scharf stepped down last fall after four years as boss of Visa.JPMorgan’s board is by no means bereft of alternatives now that Mr. Zames is joining the exodus. Trouble is, none of them is an obvious candidate to run the bank long term. Gordon Smith has had great success overseeing the consumer and community bank, not least in keeping the retail-banking and credit-card division’s tech skills ahead of the pack. But at 58 he’s only three years younger than Mr. Dimon, who has no intention of leaving any time soon.Daniel Pinto has kept the investment bank powering ahead, but has little experience in other parts of the organization. The same applies to the asset-management boss, Mary Erdoes. Doug Petno, the commercial bank chief, used to be an investment banker, but he has a relatively low profile in a smaller part of the company.There is one other candidate: Marianne Lake, who has shone as finance chief and is well known to investors. She, though, has never run a major business. Handing her the reins to the chief investment office, which she will take over from Mr. Zames, is a start. If Mr. Dimon gives her a larger profit and loss to manage, it will send a strong signal that she is the next anointed one."
CNN Drops Reza Aslan Over His Vulgar Criticism of Trump,"CNN said on Friday that it had cut ties with Reza Aslan, an Iranian-American scholar who was the host of the network’s weekly show “Believer,” after Mr. Aslan assailed President Trump in a series of vulgar messages on Twitter after the terrorist attack at London Bridge last weekend.Mr. Aslan, whose program covered global religion and began this year, apologized after his tweets on Saturday, in which he described the president as “an embarrassment to humankind” and compared him, using profanity, to a piece of excrement.His remarks came as Mr. Trump, in messages posted on Twitter minutes after the attack, criticized London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, and argued that the episode justified the president’s proposal to restrict travel to the United States by people from several predominantly Muslim countries.“CNN has decided to not move forward with production on the acquired series ‘Believer with Reza Aslan,’” a spokeswoman for the network said in a statement. “We wish Reza and his production team all the best.”Mr. Aslan, in a statement on Twitter, said he was “very disappointed” by the decision.“In these politically charged times, the tenor of our nation’s discourse has become complicated, and I recognize that CNN needs to protect its brand as an unbiased news outlet,” Mr. Aslan wrote.The discourse in television news has seemed to coarsen in recent weeks, as the national political environment has been marked by partisan divisions and rising tensions over the Trump administration.This is the second time in nine days that CNN has removed an on-air figure because of political commentary. Last week, the network said that the comedian Kathy Griffin would no longer be a host of its New Year’s Eve program, after Ms. Griffin was rebuked for posting a photograph in which she brandished a fake severed head that resembled the president’s head.CNN’s parent company, Time Warner, has also faced a backlash at another of its units, HBO, because the host Bill Maher used a racial slur during last week’s episode of his show “Real Time.” Mr. Maher apologized the next day.In his previous apology, Mr. Aslan wrote that he “should have used better language to express my shock and frustration at the president’s lack of decorum and sympathy.”On Friday, Mr. Aslan sought to clarify his role.“I am not a journalist,” Mr. Aslan wrote. “I am a social commentator and scholar. And so I agree with CNN that it is best that we part ways. I look forward to partnering with another platform in the future to continue to spread my message.”Mr. Aslan’s exit was reported earlier by Variety. “Believer” aired on Sunday evenings and had been scheduled to return for a second season."
"Cosby Trial Is a Big Deal in a Small Town, but Hardly a Media Circus","NORRISTOWN, Pa. — The coffee was just about pouring itself on Monday at the Sessano Cafe here, across the street from the Montgomery County Courthouse, where one of the most high-profile celebrity trials in decades is taking place. Pot after pot emptied — five times the usual amount — as television crews jockeyed to position their trucks outside.In this town outside Philadelphia, where high-profile court cases arrive with the frequency of comets, the sexual assault trial of Bill Cosby is benefiting local businesses, drawing the curious and packing hotels.But the scene here is far from the media circus that surrounded the O.J. Simpson murder trial in the 1990s, which was set against the glamorous backdrop of Los Angeles and produced voluminous coverage domestically and globally.In a week when the news cycle has been dominated by hearings in Washington, an election in Britain and terrorism around the world, the long-awaited trial of an American icon almost seems like an afterthought.CNN, which had planned to run a special report on the case involving Mr. Cosby on Monday to coincide with the start of the trial, postponed the program because of breaking news. On Tuesday, CTV, the Canadian broadcast network, ran a report on President Barack Obama’s visit to Montreal instead of a segment about Mr. Cosby’s trial. The British news organization Sky News has also rethought its coverage plans for the trial after the terrorist attack in London last weekend. And now that the prosecution’s two star witnesses have testified, the media’s interest in the trial may dwindle further, at least until there is a verdict.“Is it the lead story? No,” said Jean Casarez, a CNN correspondent covering the trial. “But is it being covered? Yes.”The decisions about how to handle the trial reflect more than just the flood of competing news on a given day. Newsrooms everywhere are under financial pressure, and resources are more limited than they were when the Simpson case was unfolding. With fewer employees, it is harder for news outlets to staff a dayslong, out-of-the-way event like Mr. Cosby’s trial, especially since he is on the back end of his career.And while the prosecution of Mr. Simpson was an absorbing murder mystery, there is little doubt that a sexual encounter occurred in 2004 between Mr. Cosby, now 79, and the woman whose assault allegations led to the criminal charges. The issue at stake here is whether the encounter was consensual or whether Mr. Cosby used a drug to render the woman, Andrea Constand, defenseless and then sexually assaulted her.That is not to say the media has ignored Mr. Cosby’s trial.More than 120 media outlets have been given credentials to cover it, and major national newspapers, magazines and television networks are represented in the courtroom. Several foreign news organizations from countries that include Britain, Canada and Germany are here as well. Journalists cram into the courtroom and spill into an overflow room, before rushing to the courthouse steps for comments from lawyers and others once the proceedings end for the day.“I would be willing to bet that this case is the biggest case they’ve ever had,” James Koval, director of communications for Pennsylvania’s court system, said in an interview during the lunch break on Tuesday.Mr. Koval expected an influx of journalists, so he and members of his staff began planning for the trial weeks ago, and he and another employee arrived very early in the morning at the beginning of this week to help direct the arriving television trucks. Mr. Koval has a hand-drawn diagram that details where the trucks are to park. (“Pool camera spaces are reserved the entire time!”)If the national and international media are more subdued than expected, local television stations pepper their news coverage with updates and live shots from the courthouse steps. Reporters from local news organizations have a designated seating area in the main courtroom. The Philadelphia Inquirer has run front-page stories about the trial all week.“As a local reporter, obviously this is major news because it’s in our county,” said Vincent Thompson, an anchor for WURD, an African-American talk radio station based in Philadelphia. “Norristown is not a big town, but this would overwhelm any city.”Steve Keeley, a reporter with the local television station Fox 29, said that some news organizations had left after covering the start of Ms. Constand’s testimony on Tuesday, but that his station would continue to provide complete coverage, with at least three reporters every day. “We are putting a full-court press on this,” he said.But considering Mr. Cosby’s celebrity status and the shocking stream of accusations that more than 40 women have made against him, the daily rituals and challenges of the trial seem relatively mundane.Cameramen and photographers jostle each morning for position near a walkway where the trial’s key participants enter the courthouse. Snacks for the sequestered jurors arrived late on the first day, creating a slight delay. A late delivery of potato chips before the lunch rush on Tuesday caused a minor panic among employees at Sessano, the cafe by the courthouse.And while the trial has at times had its share of legal spectacle — Mr. Cosby is greeted by a chorus of supporters and hecklers when he leaves the courthouse at the end of each day — the made-for-TV drama that many journalists longed for has largely been absent.“The story that Andrea Constand is telling is very similar to what we have heard already,” said Alison Hall, a producer with the newsmagazine show “Inside Edition.” “I do think that the trial has not been as shocking as some people expected.”"
"Pandora, Faded Star of Online Music, Gets Cash Infusion From Sirius XM","Pandora was early to the online music business, introducing a free internet radio service just a few years after Apple started iTunes and enjoying a successful debut as a public company.It was nice while it lasted.Any first-mover advantage Pandora once had has long since dwindled, as rivals including Spotify and Apple Music have become the dominant forces in an industry where consumer habits change faster than the Billboard charts.Now, in a bid to buy time, Pandora has found a partner that can give it some much-needed cash — and, perhaps down the line, become its new owner.In taking a $480 million investment from Sirius XM, the satellite radio provider, Pandora has secured a crucial infusion of money it needs to cover basic expenses. And the deal has allowed Sirius XM — controlled by the shrewd media mogul John Malone — to become the leading candidate to one day buy Pandora outright.“With this investment, we have the backing of one of the media industry’s most successful investors and significant capital to accelerate growth,” Tim Leiweke, a Pandora director, said in a statement.Or, as Mark Mulligan, a music technology analyst with Midia Research, put it: “This gives Pandora a fighting chance of making a proper go at competing.”The investment is the latest deal to shake up online music streaming, an industry that is increasingly popular with entrepreneurs and investors but has proved to be a financial sinkhole.Pandora lost $343 million last year, nearly triple what it lost in 2015. And its active monthly listener base shrank to a two-year low in this year’s first quarter, to 76.7 million.Spotify, which lets users listen to specific tracks on demand — in addition to themed stations, like Pandora’s — has raised billions of dollars and is preparing for an unconventional listing on the New York Stock Exchange this year.Tidal, a similar streaming service purchased by Jay Z, sold a stake to Sprint this year as it continued to hemorrhage cash.Amazon, Apple and Google also have streaming music offerings, and all face the same fundamental challenge: Paying for music rights and marketing has proved an expensive proposition.Pandora was particularly slow to adapt.In recent years, the success of Spotify and Apple Music made it clear that on-demand services that let customers pick virtually any song to listen to at any time would lure customers away from Pandora’s internet radio offering.Its radio business is supported by advertising that generated a respectable $1 billion in revenue last year.“Pandora’s done something sensible,” Mr. Mulligan said, “but sensible doesn’t always get enough credit.”Internet radio ads, however, are not enough to compete with the likes of Apple and Spotify.This year, Pandora rolled out Pandora Premium, a $10-a-month product that largely matches what its competitors offer.Too little, too late, analysts said, suggesting that the expense of the new product would weigh down a company that has never reported an annual profit.Enter Sirius XM.The investment came as little surprise to Wall Street. Sirius XM has flirted with doing a deal for Pandora for some time, with its chairman, Gregory B. Maffei, saying publicly that he could be interested in a transaction, but only at what he considered the right price.The deal announced on Friday includes an agreement for the two companies to work together on internet streaming on mobile devices and in cars. It also gives Sirius XM an edge in any possible takeover of Pandora, with the satellite radio provider taking not only a 19 percent stake but also three board seats, including chairman.All that gives it a formidable advantage over any other potential rival who would seek to buy Pandora, although Sirius XM agreed not to make any such move for 18 months.“Longer term, this makes it more likely that they will end up together,” said Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie.For Sirius XM — part of the constellation of companies controlled by Liberty Media — the new stake in Pandora will give it an important toehold in a number of businesses, including ad-supported radio and particularly internet radio. Despite Sirius XM’s traditional strength in cars, its new partner has an attractive presence in the wider world of internet and mobile music outside cars.“This strategic investment in Pandora represents a unique opportunity for Sirius XM to create value for its stockholders by investing in the leader in the ad-supported digital radio business, a space where Sirius XM does not play today,” James E. Meyer, Sirius XM’s chief executive, said in a statement.Although Pandora was one of the first to let customers legally stream music online, it has grappled with a host of challenges. Among them has been battling with music labels over the royalties it pays each time it plays a song.Pandora has also made a number of strategic missteps, including buying the ticket seller Ticketfly for $335 million. On Friday, the company said that it was selling the division to Eventbrite for $200 million.The agreement on Friday means Sirius XM will replace KKR, the giant investment firm, as Pandora’s major financial backer. Just last month, KKR agreed to invest $150 million in the internet radio service.Pandora, already reeling, will be penalized for swapping partners so quickly: As part of Friday’s complex series of deals, it agreed to pay KKR a $22.5 million termination fee for what amounts to a month of work."
"Comey’s Testimony Was Ratings Gold, Even at 10 A.M.","It was the testimony of a once-obscure former law enforcement official. Before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. At 10 in the morning. On a workday.Not your usual ratings gold.No matter. Roughly 19.5 million Americans tuned in on Thursday to watch James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, unspool the tale of his awkward, unsettling and, at times, ethically questionable encounters with President Trump.That is about the same number of people who watched Game 2 of this week’s N.B.A. finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers.Mr. Comey’s full audience was undoubtedly even bigger. The viewership figure released on Friday by the television tracking firm Nielsen did not include statistics for PBS, C-Span or the Fox broadcasting affiliates that carried the hearing live.And it can be difficult to account for those who congregated at viewing parties across the country.Many more people followed along with Mr. Comey on the radio or online, with numerous news sites livestreaming the proceedings. Twitter and Bloomberg News, for instance, said that their joint livestream reached an average of 129,000 viewers a minute.Regular daytime programming, such as “The View” and “The Rachael Ray Show,” was pre-empted by special reports on all three broadcast networks, which aired Mr. Comey’s nearly three-hour appearance beginning at 10 a.m. Eastern time.ABC’s coverage, with an average of about 3.29 million viewers, was the highest-rated Comey broadcast over all; CBS, whose coverage began at 9 a.m., was a close second, with about 3.28 million viewers.Fox News was the winner on cable news, drawing about 3.1 million people. CNN attracted 3.06 million viewers and beat its rivals in the 25-to-54 age demographic, which is important to advertisers, although the Comey hearing was aired commercial-free.Mr. Trump, a ratings connoisseur, can still claim some bragging rights: His inauguration in January was seen by about 30.6 million television viewers."
Opioid Dealers Embrace the Dark Web to Send Deadly Drugs by Mail,"As the nation’s opioid crisis worsens, the authorities are confronting a resurgent, unruly player in the illicit trade of the deadly drugs, one that threatens to be even more formidable than the cartels.The internet.In a growing number of arrests and overdoses, law enforcement officials say, the drugs are being bought online. Internet sales have allowed powerful synthetic opioids such as fentanyl — the fastest-growing cause of overdoses nationwide — to reach living rooms in nearly every region of the country, as they arrive in small packages in the mail.The authorities have been frustrated in their efforts to crack down on the trade because these sites generally exist on the so-called dark web, where buyers can visit anonymously using special browsers and make purchases with virtual currencies like Bitcoin.The problem of dark web sales appeared to have been stamped out in 2013, when the authorities took down the most famous online marketplace for drugs, known as Silk Road. But since then, countless successors have popped up, making the drugs readily available to tens of thousands of customers who would not otherwise have had access to them.Among the dead are two 13-year-olds, Grant Seaver and Ryan Ainsworth, who died last fall in the wealthy resort town of Park City, Utah, after taking a synthetic opioid known as U-47700 or Pinky. The boys had received the powder from another local teenager, who bought the drugs on the dark web using Bitcoin, according to the Park City police chief.“It’s unimaginable that Grant could gain access to a drug like Pinky so easily, and be gone so quickly, poof,” said Jim Seaver, Grant’s father. “The pain and brutality of this tragedy is crippling.”Largely because of their potency, synthetic opioids have become the fastest-growing cause of the overdose epidemic, overtaking heroin in some areas. Just a few flakes of fentanyl can be fatal.Their deadly efficiency also makes them ideal for sale online. Unlike heroin and prescription painkillers, which are relatively bulky, enough fentanyl to get nearly 50,000 people high can fit in a standard first-class envelope.Dark net drug markets first gained attention six years ago with the rise of Silk Road, the online market created by Ross Ulbricht. Mr. Ulbricht was arrested and the site taken down in late 2013, but imitators quickly proliferated.No federal agencies have released data on the prevalence of drugs ordered online. But the leading sites are doing far more business than the original Silk Road, according to findings by RAND Europe and researchers at Carnegie Mellon University.The authorities say these markets account for a small proportion of the overall traffic in most drugs, including heroin and cocaine. But when it comes to synthetic opioids, many authorities tracking the traffic say that dark web markets have quickly assumed a more prominent and frightening role.The dark web “has become such an important source of distribution for this sort of deadly drug,” said Kathryn Haun, who was a prosecutor in San Francisco until last month, and the Justice Department’s first Digital Currency Coordinator. “It has enabled distribution channels that previously didn’t exist.”As of Friday, the leading dark net market, AlphaBay, had more than 21,000 listings for opioids and more than 4,100 for fentanyl and similar drugs, from dozens of dealers large and small. Many of those individual listings are like items in a catalog, representing an endless back-room supply of pills, powders and nasal sprays.Just last month, the federal authorities announced charges against a six-person operation in Utah that was purchasing fentanyl in bulk from China on the dark web and then pressing the powder into pills and selling the pills on the dark web to users in the United States.The authorities said the group had sold hundreds of thousands of these pills, often marketed as less dangerous drugs like Xanax and Oxycodone.The alleged ringleader of the operation, Aaron Shamo, was identified by many AlphaBay users as the vendor known as Pharma-Master, who had 8,332 verified sales on the site.The social forums on AlphaBay and other sites are filled with conversations about how potent the drugs are, with frequent mentions of trips that ended up in emergency room visits or blackouts.“I was injecting slowly got 1/3rd of the hit in, next thing i know i wake up with 3 paramedics above me,” a user named AgentOrange 007 wrote in a forum posting on AlphaBay. “If i hadn’t been found because i was making a loud snoring sound (tongue rolled back in my throat) i’d be dead no doubt.”Court documents show that in the last year, there have been more than two dozen arrests of American drug dealers who were operating significant operations buying or selling synthetic opioids online, most of which were tied to specific overdose deaths.In late February, a man in South Carolina was accused of receiving more than three kilograms of fentanyl ordered on the dark net — or enough to kill 1.5 million adults, given that just two milligrams is a lethal dose.A few weeks later in New Jersey, authorities arrested Chukwuemeka Okparaeke, who allegedly went by the screen name of Fentmaster on AlphaBay. He had received two kilograms of fentanyl from an address in Hong Kong, according to a criminal complaint.Then in April, a Cleveland man, Alec Steinberger, 21, was arrested and accused of receiving a package of furanyl fentanyl that he was preparing to sell on the streets. He is said to have texted a 19-year-old who was helping him distribute the drugs to warn about their strength.“Bro I did it last night any my pupils got so small they disappeared and then I was nodding for 18 hrs,” the text said, according to the indictment.When the 19-year-old tried the drugs, he overdosed and died.Mr. Okparaeke, Mr. Steinberger and Mr. Shamo have all pleaded not guilty. Lawyers for the men had no comment on their cases.Law enforcement officials investigating these cases say that public documents underrepresent the number of cases involving the dark web because many court documents don’t mention the online sources of the drugs.And many cases — including the death last year of the musician Prince from a fentanyl overdose — are still being investigated because of the relatively recent advent of the phenomenon.“It has come to play a key role in the overdose crisis,” said Tim Plancon, who oversees the Drug Enforcement Administration in Kentucky, Michigan and Ohio, states at the epicenter of the overdose crisis. “It’s expanded beyond just your traditional drug smuggling and trafficking. There is just a lot more involved with it when you are dealing with folks on the dark web with virtual currencies.”The United States is not the only country dealing with an influx of mail-order synthetic opioids. Canada and several European countries have also made recent arrests of suspects accused of being major online drug dealers responsible for multiple deaths.But the numbers are particularly staggering in America. In 2015, the last year for which national data is available, fentanyl and similar drugs killed 9,580 people, or 73 percent more than 2014. The number of deaths rose even faster last year in areas that have released figures, such as Ohio and New Hampshire. Over all, deaths from drug overdoses are soaring in the United States, and most likely exceeded 59,000 last year.Authorities say that most of the illicit supply of synthetic opioids is produced in labs in Asia and especially China, where many of the precursor chemicals are either legal or easier to procure.Latin American drug cartels are also getting synthetic opioids from Asia and moving them into the United States. But the operational ease of sending the drugs through the mail gives the method obvious appeal for Chinese producers, many of whom are technologically skilled enough to set up their own dark web shops.One of the most frequently reviewed vendors of synthetic opioids on AlphaBay goes by the screen name BenzoChems. The vendor has shared online videos of his operations in China.In a series of messages exchanged on AlphaBay’s internal messaging system, BenzoChems, who declined to provide his real name, said he had found that routing packages through Hong Kong, and then through the United States Postal Service, was the most efficient method of transit.Some Chinese producers also list synthetic opioids for sale on websites on the ordinary internet, without requiring users to navigate to them through a special dark web browser. But most of the recent criminal complaints in the United States appear to involve drugs procured through markets that exist only on the dark web.BenzoChems said that he had sold his products on ordinary websites, but those sites were quickly shut down by the authorities.Dark web technology was originally developed by American intelligence agencies to allow for encrypted communication. News organizations, including The New York Times, use it to receive story tips from vulnerable sources.But the illicit markets enabled by the dark web have made stopping the flow of deadly drugs much more complicated than it was when the authorities were trying to stop earlier waves of drug overdoses.“We could give you a pretty good idea of the drug traffickers in town who can order kilos from Mexico — that’s a known commodity,” said Joseph M. Pinjuh, the chief of the organized crime task force in the United States attorney’s office in Cleveland. “What’s harder to track is the person ordering this from his grandmother’s basement.”Lawmakers have tried to attack the problem by introducing legislation in Congress that would tighten the requirements on information gathered by the Postal Service. Last month,  at a Senate hearing on the problem, Postal Service officials said they were working to collect information on more packages coming from China.In recent months, though, the number of listings for fentanyl on AlphaBay and other dark web sites has been rising steadily.Ms. Haun, the former federal prosecutor in San Francisco, said the tools that enabled dark web commerce made it very unlikely that the expanding traffic would be curtailed anytime soon.“It’s only going to increase, and increase the types of communities and markets that might not have had as easy access to it before,” she said."
5 Things to Consider Before Buying Today’s Hot Investment,"We are again nearing what appear to be all-time highs in the stock market, and when that happens, people tend to say and do strange things. This time around, Amazon, Apple, Google (in the form of its parent company, Alphabet), Microsoft and Netflix are worth $2.4 trillion all on their own, accounting for 13 percent of the entire American economy.And so everyone wants in on them, from mutual fund managers who have to keep up with the overall stock market’s performance in order to keep their jobs to individuals who suddenly realize just how essential many of these companies have become to their lives.You, however, don’t have to follow the herd. You don’t have to lose your head. You need not chase the lemmings buying Bitcoin again.Instead, consider these five things.Somewhere there is someone who bought all five of these tech stocks when they were at their lowest price in the past decade, or at their initial public offerings or at some other opportune moment. But that investor is probably lucky. (If not, he or she should start a mutual fund, and you should invest, except you couldn’t be sure that the person’s skill would persist, so you’d need to rely on luck for that.)Picking stocks and mutual funds that will do better than other similar investments is a hard thing to do and then repeat over long periods. Maybe you know more than anyone else betting on the same companies, but chances are you don’t. So if you win, you’re lucky.

Flexibility That A.C.A. Lent to Work Force Is Threatened by G.O.P. Plan,"In recent years, millions of middle- and working-class Americans have moved from job to job, some staying with one company for shorter stints or shifting careers midstream.The Affordable Care Act has enabled many of those workers to get transitional coverage that provides a bridge to the next phase of their lives — a stopgap to get health insurance if they leave a job, are laid off, start a business or retire early.If the Republican replacement plan approved by the House becomes law, changing jobs or careers could become much more difficult.Across the nation, Americans in their 50s and early 60s, still too young to qualify for Medicare, could be hit hard by soaring insurance costs, especially people now eligible for generous subsidies through the existing federal health care law.This news scares Fern Warnat, 59. She has gotten insurance on the federal marketplace a couple of times in the last few years. When she and her husband moved from New York to Boca Raton, Fla., she bought a policy for a few months to tide her over until she got coverage from a new job. A year later, she needed to buy insurance again when she found herself unemployed. The policy was expensive — around $800 a month.“It wasn’t easy, but it was available,” she said.Now she worries what would happen under the Republican plan if she left her job at a home health company that provides insurance.“I need something to be there,” she said. “I’m going to be 60 years old. All my conditions pre-exist.”Since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, companies have become less worried about people who want to leave but feel locked into their jobs because of health insurance, said Julie Stone, who works with corporations at Willis Towers Watson, a benefits consultant. The law “removed one of the barriers to leaving your job,” she said.Fewer employers now offer health insurance for their retirees, she said. The other alternative is Cobra, the federal law that requires companies to allow workers to remain on their employer’s plan if they pay the full monthly premiums, which are often extremely expensive and out of reach for many people. The coverage generally lasts no more than a year and a half. Cobra was a “Band-Aid on a broken market,” Ms. Stone said.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in an analysis last month that states covering one-sixth of the population would take waivers that allowed insurers to charge people with pre-existing conditions more. It predicted that such consumers “would be unable to purchase comprehensive coverage with premiums close to those under current law and might not be able to purchase coverage at all.”The budget office did note that the House bill would potentially lead to lower prices, especially for younger and healthier people. In most markets, the low premiums would “attract a sufficient number of relatively healthy people to stabilize the market.”But the budget office also warned that markets in states that allowed insurers to charge higher premiums for people with pre-existing conditions — whether high blood pressure, a one-time visit to a specialist or cancer — could become unstable. Some places are already experiencing a dearth of insurers. More companies could exit as they struggled to make money in highly uncertain conditions.Millions of people could also wind up with little choice but to buy cheap plans that provided minimal coverage in states that opted out of requiring insurers to cover maternity care, mental health and addiction treatment or rehabilitation services, among other services required under the Affordable Care Act. Consumers who could not afford high premiums would wind up with enormous out-of-pocket medical expenses.The individual market has always been characterized by heavy churn, and insurers struggle to meet the needs of these short-timers, particularly the young and healthy, for whom coverage can be expensive. “It’s a huge challenge, even independent of the A.C.A.,” said John Graves, a health policy expert at Vanderbilt University.Insurers say they have had a hard time accurately estimating the medical costs of the changing pool of customers who need relatively short-term coverage and pricing their plans high enough to cover those costs. Aetna, one of the large national insurers that has decided to leave the market, said about half of its customers were new, and it blamed “high churn” as one reason the company lost money.Older people with potentially the most expensive conditions account for almost 30 percent of those who enrolled for insurance on the exchanges this year.David Clark wanted to retire from his job at Sam’s Club at age 62, three years before he would qualify for Medicare. He and his wife, Phyllis, who now live in Delray Beach, Fla., were not in good health. He has a heart ailment, and she has diabetes. Before passage of the Affordable Care Act, he said, he would have had to keep working.“We wouldn’t have been able to buy insurance at any price,” he said.But he was able to retire and get coverage on one of the marketplaces. “This has been three of the greatest years of our life,” said Mr. Clark, who spends much of his time mentoring college students. When he needed triple bypass surgery at age 64, he was covered.Many people are keenly aware that the existing marketplaces provide a safety net, even if it is far from ideal.Dr. Marie Valleroy was able to stop working because she could afford to buy insurance on the federal exchange for four years until she was old enough to get Medicare. She has multiple sclerosis, and her symptoms were making it harder for her to see patients in Portland, Ore. “It was time for me to retire, truthfully,” she said. Her medications cost upward of $5,000 a month.And the law made it possible for Bobby Evans, now 35, to move to New Orleans two years ago to be with his girlfriend, now his wife. Because he was working part time until he could find a permanent position, he bought a policy through the state marketplace.He and his wife have talked about opening their own consulting firm, but the plan is being delayed, he said, depending on what happens with the federal law providing individual insurance. “Health care is a big-time barrier for a lot of people’s professional growth,” Mr. Evans said."
"In Watergate, One Set of Facts. In Trump Era, Take Your Pick.","It’s a question that has hung out there throughout our hyper-driven, hyper-divided media era: What would Watergate look like if it were to happen now?We no longer have to wonder.Forget Deep Throat, the anonymous senior F.B.I. official whom history so fondly remembers for guiding Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward through the corruption scandal and cover-up that began with a break-in at the Democratic National Committee and ended with President Richard M. Nixon’s resignation.We now have “the deep state,” the scheming coterie in the intelligence community supposedly seeking to take down the president to protect its own power, as the viral Web conspiracy goes.Once again, a senior F.B.I. official — James B. Comey, fired by President Trump — has played a central role in the drama by becoming a primary source for reporters covering an unfolding political scandal that is transfixing the nation and consuming a White House. (Deep Throat was the deputy F.B.I. director, W. Mark Felt.)But whether Mr. Comey is bravely blowing the whistle on wrongdoing at the highest levels of government, à la Mr. Felt, or showboating on a nonstory is under intense debate in certain robust media quarters.So, too, is whether the latter-day Woodwards and Bernsteins covering the latest break-in at the Democratic National Committee — this time, a suspected cyberattack by the Russians — are worthy of Pulitzer Prizes or professional-wrestling-style body slams.Of course, Watergate unfolded in a much simpler time in the media industry.There were three major news networks and PBS; a major paper or three in every city; and a political dynamic in which leaders duked it out by day and dined together at night. They did so on a solid foundation of agreed-upon facts and a sense of right and wrong that was shared if not always followed.The Trump-Russia scandal is breaking during a time of informational chaos, when rival versions of reality are fighting for narrative supremacy.The causes are legion: The advent of right-wing talk radio and Fox News; the influence of social sites like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit; and the mainstreaming of conspiracy sites like InfoWars, which had almost five million visitors in the last month. By allowing partisans to live in their separate informational and misinformational bubbles, and, in some cases, to allow real news to be rendered as false — and false news to be rendered as true — they have all contributed to the calcification of the national divide.Mainstream journalism, a shiny and ascendant conveyor of truth during Watergate, is in a battered state after decades of economic erosion, its own mistakes and the efforts of partisan wrecking crews to discredit its work, the most recent one led by the president himself.All of it gives the Trump White House something Nixon never had: a loyal media armada ready to attack inconvenient truths and the credibility of potentially damning witnesses and news reports while trumpeting the presidential counternarrative, at times with counterfactual versions of events.Review papers from the Nixon White House and you can see just how much Nixon and his team pined for a media environment resembling the one today.“Nixon was always complaining that he had no defenders,” John Dean, the former Nixon White House counsel, and current CNN contributor, told me Friday.As a memo from one adviser read in 1970: “The lens through which our message gets through is a distorted lens,” therefore “we ought to give consideration to ways and means if necessary to acquire either a government or other network through which we can tell our story.”When a separate memo presented a more detailed plan for a pro-administration news service, White House records show, another adviser, Roger E. Ailes, raised his hand to start it. The plan fizzled, but Mr. Ailes, who died last month, would start the Fox News Channel some 25 years later.With no counterinformational media cocoons on Nixon’s side, his die-hard partisans had to watch as The Washington Post, followed by The New York Times and, eventually, television and the rest of the news media, pounded away at all the Watergate developments. “It does affect public opinion, which affects Congress, which affects impeachment proceedings,” Mr. Dean told me.Mr. Dean became a star witness for Senate investigators in June 1973, describing in his nationally televised testimony how Nixon was complicit in the Watergate cover-up. But the White House did not present any sort of visibly aggressive defense until Mr. Nixon’s onetime counsel, Charles W. Colson, got on the “CBS Evening News” at the end of Mr. Dean’s second day of testimony, arguing that Mr. Dean was a liar out to cover his own hide.That kind of delayed response would be unthinkable today. The pro-Trump pushback on Mr. Comey’s testimony was immediate, with the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., live-tweeting attacks on Mr. Comey while Mr. Comey testified; his father following up the next morning and through the weekend; and various Twitter followers piling on.While Mr. Colson had to go on the news program of Walter Cronkite, the “most trusted man in America,” Mr. Trump’s son could make his case before Team Fox, populated as it is with friendlies like Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro — whose interview with Donald Trump Jr. on Saturday coincided with her attendance at the baby shower for Mr. Trump’s sister-in-law, Lara Trump.The most vital and trusted news source for a large percentage of “consistent conservatives,” according to Pew, Fox focused as much on Mr. Comey’s potential motives and actions as it did on the substance of his central charge: that the president of the United States sought to derail an F.B.I. investigation into ties between Russia and his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, as Russia allegedly sought to influence an election.Mr. Comey’s historic testimony exploded onto the front pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post, and drove ample discussion across the major news networks as well as on CNN, MSNBC and Fox News’s straight-news programs like “Shepard Smith Reporting” and “Special Report.” But where the “darkening cloud” metaphors piled up in those provinces, there were clearing skies Friday night on Fox, as the host Tucker Carlson assured his audience: “This whole story is a hoax.”Then again, Rush Limbaugh and various other Trump-friendly media outlets and online freelancers had been saying the same for weeks, sometimes fed by whole-cloth tales bouncing around the Web. One of them, outlined by my Times colleague Jeremy W. Peters on Sunday, falsely asserted that Mr. Comey had previously claimed that Mr. Trump had not sought to impede the investigation.When I asked Mr. Woodward earlier this year if the Watergate charges would have forced a presidential resignation in this environment, he said he believed they would have. The strength of the evidence, including the Oval Office tapes of Nixon engaged in the plotting, was too overwhelming to be denied in any environment, he said.Mr. Bernstein wasn’t so sure when we spoke on Friday. “The big difference between then and now is that there was an open-mindedness among citizens in the country to the best obtainable version of the truth,” he said.Now, ”more and more people,’’ he said, “are looking for information in the media and elsewhere that will reinforce what they already believe.”He put the onus for that on “a media culture and a political culture — and a larger culture — that is a caldron of outrage.”Yet what will matter most is whether the special counsel investigating the ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, Robert S. Mueller III, finds any actual wrongdoing.Maybe he won’t. But if he does, how much of the country will believe it?"
All the Ways Apple’s iOS 11 Will Change Your iPhone,"Apple’s latest operating system for iPhones and iPads is set to roll out on September 19th, bringing with it a number of new features and tweaks that are designed to make your phone safer to use and more customizable.iOS 11 was actually announced at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where it also unveiled its new HomePod speaker, a competitor to Amazon’s Echo, and unveiled a new iMac Pro, along with upgraded iMacs and MacBooks. Similarly, when Apple unveiled the iPhone 8 and iPhone X last week, they noted iOS 11 would roll out this week—and ship on those newly announced phones. Here’s a rundown of some of iOS 11’s biggest features.We all know how dangerous texting, or using your phone in general, while driving can be, but it doesn’t stop people from thinking they can get away with it. Plus, buzzing alerts on your phone are distracting even if you don’t look at them (and sometimes it seems like they never stop). Apple’s next update will include a possible solution to that problem: It will automatically block notifications when your phone thinks you are behind the wheel.Texts sent via iMessage will also be intercepted. When one arrives, the phone will send an automatic reply saying you are driving and that you’ll respond when you get to your destination. (You can program your phone to let some numbers through the blockade, so loved ones can reach you in a pinch.) When the phone has determined that you’ve stopped driving, your screen will come back to life, and you can catch up on everything you’ve missed.The Control Center, that panel full of easily-accessed buttons and tools you see when you swipe up from the bottom of your iPhone screen, will also get an overhaul in the new update. Soon all the controls will be located on one colorful, widget-filled page.Some have complained that the new layout is confusing and cluttered, but it doesn’t have to be: The Control Center will be customizable, so you can add as many (or as few) widgets as you like, including quick access to your camera, calculator or Apple TV.Additionally, there’s a new toggle for the iPhone’s “Low Power” mode, designed to save battery life while you’re out without a spot to charge your phone. The new Control Center also features quick accessibility settings, including options to magnify your screen, change the brightness, make text display larger (or smaller), enable Do Not Disturb mode, and more. And each setting now makes use of Apple’s “3D Touch” feature, where pressing and holding on an icon brings up additional useful options.Siri, Apple’s personal assistant program, will get an overhaul too. The company said the program will soon have “a new, more natural voice” that will be more “expressive” than the robotic lilt it currently has. At the conference last week, some audio of both the male and female voices were played to showcase its more nuanced pronunciations. But the biggest changes for Siri will be under the hood, powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence.Here is what that means: Apple says Siri will learn so much from you that it will be able to anticipate your needs and make suggestions before you even ask for them.For example, it will offer news stories based on things it has learned you like. If you’re texting a friend about a film you saw or a place you visited, Siri will auto-type the name of the movie or the place. It will suggest new searches for you in Safari based on articles you’ve read. It will automatically queue up songs you like, suggest songs it thinks you will like or answer trivia questions about songs you play.Siri is going to know a lot about you.iOS 11 will also help save storage on your phone. When your storage runs low, a new optional feature will automatically remove apps you don’t use very often. It is called “Offload Unused Apps” and you can turn it on by going to Settings, then tapping General. The selected apps are removed, and you get back all of the space they were using, which can be especially useful for people who’ll need to make room for more photos, for phone updates, or just to download music or movies for a long flight.Don’t worry, though. Your phone will keep any data you have associated with the deleted app, which will display as a gray icon after it has been removed. If you ever want to reinstall it, all you have to do is tap the gray icon and everything is back to the way it was.(Even before iOS 11 is released, users may find themselves receiving warnings about some apps that have not kept pace with Apple’s changes.)Apple’s mobile payment system, Apple Pay, will also get a boost with the new update. Using your credit or debit card, you will be able to send money to anyone who also uses iOS11 with just a text message, which can be especially useful for splitting the check at a restaurant, paying someone gas money, or even paying the rent if you’re close with your landlord. You even get an electronic receipt that shows the payment went through.Receiving money from someone will be just as easy. Once you’ve been paid via text message you can either use Apple Pay to spend that money at stores and online or you can transfer it to your bank account. Think of it as a version of Venmo that is restricted to (or especially for, depending on your perspective) Apple users. If you already use Apple Pay to pay for purchases at participating retailers, the ability to quickly send and receive money from other iPhone users may appeal to you. Unfortunately the feature won’t be ready at launch, according to TechCrunch, but with a later release to iOS 11 coming this fall.This article was initially published on June 12, 2017, and was updated on September 18th, 2017. It was updated again on September 20th to note that Apple Pay is not available at launch. "
Morning Agenda: Time for a Break for Travis Kalanick?,"It could finally be time for Travis Kalanick to take a break.Uber’s board was considering a three-month leave of absence for Mr. Kalanick, the company’s chief executive, according to people with knowledge of the board’s agenda.The ride-hailing service’s directors also unanimously voted to adopt all the recommendations made in a report by the former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., who led an investigation into the company’s cultureThese recommendations include the departure of Emil Michael, senior vice president of business and a close confidant of Mr. Kalanick’s.Uber’s chief executive had already proposed taking time off after a boating accident that killed his mother and sent his father to hospital.But the move to lessen Mr. Kalanick’s involvement and strip him of an ally could also mark a repudiation of the aggressive culture that he has fostered at Uber.“This starts at the very top,” said Micah Alpern, a principal at A. T. Kearney, a management and consulting firm. “They need to start from scratch to create a new culture entirely.”Uber has been roiled by concerns over sexual harassment and workplace culture, the mishandling of the medical records of a woman raped by an Uber driver in India, investigations into the tools it used to evade law enforcement, and a lawsuit over intellectual property.Mr. Kalanick’s position has been secure, however, because he and a few allies hold the majority of super-voting shares on the board.• Related: Uber faces a dilemma in Egypt, a country of 92 million with low rates of car ownership, that could become a prize market for the company. The Egyptian government wants access to “heaven,” the internal software that tracks every Uber ride and could be a powerful tool for the country’s security services.The only thing that’s certain after the election in Britain last week is more uncertainty.The Conservatives lost their governing majority, weakening their hand just as they move toward negotiations to leave the European Union.The pound was looking steadier on Monday morning after a steep plunge after exit polls were released.But the weaker pound has already pushed up costs for consumers, raising questions about whether consumption, a main driver of economic activity, can keep the economy going.Financial services are already planning to move jobs out of the country, and investment is expected to slow.In light of this, as well as poor business confidence, business groups have been pushing for the government to strike a deal on leaving the European Union quickly.Amazon’s warehouses are known as being a grueling place to work, but one former employee claims that managers are pushed too hard.Michael Ortiz, a former shift manager for Amazon, has accused the company in a lawsuit of failing to pay him overtime wages.Entry level workers are eligible for overtime pay under company policy, but salaried managers are not.Mr. Ortiz claimed that in spite of assurances that he would be doing supervisory work, he ended up doing manual labor. The plaintiff is seeking class action status.California’s employee-friendly labor laws could give the case a better chance of success. Amazon will have to prove that more than half a person’s job involved managerial work.• The Federal Reserve is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate this week after a two-day meeting. Economists expect at least two more rate increases this year.The news conference after the meeting will be closely watched to see if Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, will discuss plans to reduce the central bank’s investment holdings, a final stage in unwinding its postcrisis economic stimulus program."
Movers: Jeff Immelt Out as C.E.O. of G.E.,"We’re following major market developments throughout the day.General Electric is making some changes at the top.The industrial giant said on Monday that its chairman and chief executive, Jeffrey R.

Mr. Flannery, a 30-year veteran of G.E., will add the role of chairman on Jan. 1.The leadership change comes 16 years after Mr. Immelt replaced Jack Welch, G.E.’s legendary chairman and chief executive, and as the company has sought to return its focus on its industrial roots after years of expansion into finance.G.E. also said that Jeff Bornstein, the company’s chief financial officer, would be promoted to vice chairman.• Uber’s board has met, and has agreed to adopt all of the recommendations made in a report by the former United States attorney general Eric H.

"New iPad Pro Inches Toward Replacing PC, but Falls Short","When Steve Jobs introduced the first iPad in 2010, he described the tablet as a product that sat somewhere between the laptop and the smartphone, excelling at tasks like browsing the web, reviewing photos and watching videos.Five years later, Mr. Jobs’s successor, Timothy D. Cook, took the iPad a step further. Unveiling the iPad Pro, a souped-up tablet that worked with Apple’s keyboard and stylus, he remarked that people would try the product and “conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones.”That prediction has not appeared to come true. Many professionals say they use an iPad in addition to a personal computer, and sales of iPads have shrunk quarter after quarter for more than a year, an indication that hordes of people were not trading in their PCs for tablets just yet.That situation is unlikely to change with Apple’s newest iPad Pro, which will be released this week. The professional tablet, which comes in two screen sizes — 10.5 or 12.9 diagonal inches — is incrementally improved from previous models. It is faster, with a brighter display and a higher refresh rate that makes motion look buttery smooth. In addition, the screen on the smaller iPad Pro has been enlarged slightly from 9.7 inches.But after about a week of testing the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, I concluded that Apple’s professional tablet still suffers from some of the same problems when compared with a laptop. Most important, keyboard typing is not comfortable, and some tasks are better done with a mouse than with a touch screen. In the end, I would still recommend a traditional laptop for most professionals.What Has ImprovedThe most significant improvement to the iPad Pro is speed. The new tablet is notably faster: In speed tests run with the app Geekbench, the new iPad Pro was roughly 50 percent faster than its predecessor.That means if you upgrade from an iPad older than last year’s model, you will get a tremendous speed increase. The speed boost makes the new iPad Pro better at intense tasks like juggling multiple apps, editing high-resolution photos and playing graphics-heavy games.The new iPad Pros also include a higher screen refresh rate. That makes motion look smoother, which is noticeable when opening or closing apps and scrolling through documents or websites. It is also supposed to make some games look better, but as of this writing, game developers had yet to update their apps to support the higher refresh rate.The other notable change is the increased screen size of the smaller iPad Pro. Apple slimmed down the bezel — or the border surrounding the screen — to make more room for the display; the tablet’s body is also slightly larger and heavier. Over all, this is a better size for the smaller iPad Pro, partly because the increased size also gave room for Apple to make a slightly larger version of its physical keyboard, called Smart Keyboard.Apple also made a nice improvement to its accessories for carrying and protecting the iPad Pro. It now sells a stylish $129 leather sleeve that includes a holder for its stylus, Apple Pencil, which addresses a concern that people could easily lose the stylus. The sleeve is just roomy enough to also hold an iPad Pro with a Smart Keyboard cover folded over it.What Falls ShortEnlarging the smaller iPad Pro was an effort to address the tablet’s greatest weakness: typing. The Smart Keyboard is essentially a protective cover for the screen with a keyboard and magnet built into it. When you open it, the tablet rests on top of the keyboard, held in place by the magnet.Here’s the problem: The Smart Keyboard is thin and the keys do not click well or feel as satisfying to type on as the keyboards on a MacBook Pro or MacBook Air; after a long period of typing, the Smart Keyboard felt flimsy. The keyboard for the 10.5-inch model is still small and cramped compared with a MacBook keyboard.The other issue is ergonomics. Using the touch screen in combination with the Apple keyboard can be a pain on the wrist.Say, for example, you are using the keyboard to scroll through an email or website: If you want to open a link, you have to lift your hand away from the keyboard and tap the link. Or say you want to adjust the screen brightness or hit pause on a music track while typing: Both actions require reaching up and touching the screen. These keyboard-to-touch-screen reps get tiring.In my experience, using a keyboard and trackpad on a laptop feels like a more comfortable combination for crunching through a busy day of emails, messages, documents, spreadsheets and calendar entries.The other issues with the iPad are related to software and may be resolved this year. For example, you can have two apps open side by side with the iPad Pro. You can use each app independently, but the two apps cannot interact with each other easily: You cannot drag and drop a photo or file from one app to the other, for example. Fortunately, Apple is set to release a drag-and-drop feature this fall in iOS 11, its next mobile operating system. The operating system will also add the ability to display up to three apps at the same time and introduce a file system, which could make juggling tasks between applications easier.Who should buy one?In its current state, the iPad Pro is in an awkward position among Apple’s product lineup. A small set of professionals who do not do much typing — like artists and illustrators — could probably get away with using an iPad Pro with a stylus as a stand-alone computer. But most professionals would probably benefit from using a personal computer combined with a smartphone and tablet.There is little reason to consider an iPad Pro, which starts at about $649, if you are not also planning to purchase the optional $159 Apple Smart Keyboard or $99 Apple Pencil. It would be overkill to spend that much on an iPad without the accessories.If all you are looking for is a tablet for casual purposes like streaming Netflix, reading books or sending email, a standard iPad that lacks compatibility with the Apple keyboard and stylus costs $329 and will be powerful enough to suit your needs. (Or you could just get a big-screen smartphone and skip tablets altogether.)As for me, I must confess: I used the iPad Pro in research and outlining for this review. But when it came to writing it while reviewing notes simultaneously, I switched back to my MacBook Air, largely because the keyboard felt better to type on and it was easier to multitask with several apps."
"Cash Faces a New Challenger in Zelle, a Mobile Banking Service","The days of cash as king may be a step closer to ending.After six years of laying a foundation, major banks are ready to introduce Zelle, a digital payments network that will allow people to send money instantly through participating banks’ mobile apps.But Zelle faces competition. Since the banks began experimenting with peer-to-peer mobile payments, several upstarts like Venmo entered the field, building a loyal following.What makes Zelle (pronounced “zell,” as in “gazelle,” the nimble creature that inspired the service’s name) stand out from rivals — most prominently, Venmo, the currency of choice for many millennials — are the big banks backing it. More than 30 of them, including Bank of America, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, have teamed up to create the new network and throw their combined weight and marketing power behind it.“Nearly all banked Americans will be able to access this,” said Michael Moeser, the director of payments at Javelin Strategy, a financial industry research firm. “That’s a huge breakthrough.”The casual payments that people make every day — $20 for the dog walker or $50 to split a dinner check with friends — have long been one of the American banking system’s thorniest problems. Instant person-to-person payments are common in many countries, but in the United States, sending cash between banks is often a technical ordeal.Zelle’s pitch is that it will be fast, free and ubiquitous. The interface is almost identical at each participating bank, and setting it up takes a few seconds. To send money to others, you need only their phone number or email address. If their bank is part of Zelle’s network, recipients can immediately sweep the cash into their own checking account.Participating banks are incorporating Zelle’s transfer system into their mobile apps, sparing customers from having to download a separate app. About 86 million people will soon have access, according to Early Warning Services, the bank-owned consortium in Scottsdale, Ariz., that runs the network.A stand-alone Zelle app will be released this year. Until then, those outside the network can collect payments through Zelle by manually filling in their banking information and linking their accounts.Wells Fargo, which plans to formally introduce Zelle to its customers this month, has already, like many other banks, quietly built much of the service’s functionality into its mobile app. When it officially turns Zelle on, the money-transfer system in its app will adopt Zelle’s common branding and interface, which is built around two activities: “send” and “receive.”“We think the simplicity and shared experience around this will magnify the network effect,” said Brett Pitts, a Wells Fargo executive.That effect — when millions of people flock to a product and, through mass adoption, enhance its utility — is both Zelle’s biggest opportunity and its greatest risk. By taking so long to build their own easy-to-use mobile payments system, the banks opened the door to challengers like Venmo, Popmoney, Square Cash and Apple Pay, each of which has its own devoted users.“This isn’t a slam dunk. The banks have a big branding and awareness challenge,” Mr. Moeser said. “This has to be done well right out of the gate.”In the banks’ favor are the vast number of people who have already entrusted them with their finances. Those customers are often willing to put up with some frustrations to avoid the hassles and risks that come with using outside services.Venmo, the most popular of the upstarts (and now owned by PayPal), handled payments of $17.6 billion in 2016. The banks in Zelle’s network collectively processed $55 billion in person-to-person transactions last year, according to Early Warning.Zelle’s other advantage is its speed. Money transferred through the network will be available to the recipient immediately, participating banks say. Other services, including Venmo, usually take at least a day to complete transfers to a bank account. (Venmo has said it will enable instant withdrawals this year.)U.S. Bank, one of Zelle’s partners, began offering real-time transfers a year ago within its partner network, and found that senders valued it just as much as those they were paying, according to Gareth Gaston, who leads U.S. Bank’s non-branch banking channels.“People told us they really liked the reassurance of knowing the money was gone immediately, as opposed to waiting for a check to clear,” Mr. Gaston said. “It was an interesting surprise.”Banks began laying the technical infrastructure for Zelle in 2011 through a shared transfer network called clearXchange. But that service, which served banks’ needs more than their customers’, was fairly clunky, and its design and features varied at each bank. Zelle, built atop clearXchange’s infrastructure, is the industry’s first attempt at creating a unified consumer brand.When banks began experimenting with person-to-person transfers, they hoped it would be a moneymaker, with customers paying fees for the convenience of moving their cash around electronically. But the banks moved slowly and competitors flooded in, offering free bank-to-bank transfers as a way to draw in users. (Customers typically pay a fee of about 3 percent if they make payments with credit cards.)To keep up, the banks have been forced to match their rivals’ price tag: free. Early Warning lets banks set their own user fees for Zelle, but none have announced plans to charge customers for bank-to-bank transfers.“We see this being something that is part of your core checking experience,” Mr. Gaston said. “The other players in the marketplace are evidence that this is something customers want to have.”Zelle has been called the banks’ “Venmo killer,” but Venmo insists that it sees room in the market for multiple services.“Cash is the common enemy,” said Josh Criscoe, a Venmo spokesman.The banks drew on some of Venmo’s popular features — Zelle’s interface is similarly stripped-down and simple — but skipped others, like the emoji-strewn social feed that allows Venmo users to broadcast their payment stream to their friends. (Or, if they choose, to the entire world.)Mr. Moeser, the analyst at Javelin, thinks the mobile payments market has plenty of room for both Venmo and Zelle to thrive.“I don’t think this is a winner-take-all scenario,” he said. “There’s a huge population of consumers, particularly those over 45, who haven’t used mobile payments yet. It’s a hurdle for people — maybe they don’t want to download an app, or mess around with settings. But once people try it a couple of times, and see ‘wow, it worked!’ they tend to get over that hurdle and love it.”"
Daily Report: Another Week of Uber News,"Uber has had a headline-making year in 2017 — for the wrong kinds of reasons. The ride-hailing company has been in the news for problems such as sexual harassment claims, intellectual property fights and the use of tools to evade law enforcement personnel.Now more Uber news is in the making this week.Over the weekend, Uber’s board of directors met to discuss a proposed leave of absence for its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, who built the company into a behemoth, writes Mike Isaac, a technology reporter for The New York Times.Uber’s board met ahead of the release of a report this week into Uber’s workplace culture, conducted by the former United States attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr. Among other things, Mr. Holder is said to have recommended the exit of a top Uber lieutenant, Emil Michael, who is a member of Mr. Kalanick’s inner circle. Mr. Michael left the company on Monday. A board representative said late Sunday that the board had decided to accept all of the report’s recommendations.On Tuesday, Mr. Holder’s report will be discussed with Uber employees and made public — at least partially. Depending on what the details of the findings are, they may prompt another round of introspection on what Uber should, could or would have done differently.No matter what the findings contain, one thing is for sure: There will be more Uber headlines this week, and perhaps not of the pretty kind."
A Slump in Tech Stocks That Leaves Some Investors Mystified,"The laws of gravity apparently apply to technology stocks after all.After a relentless three-year ascent, large bellwether companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon led a two-day sell-off, prompting fears of a wider stock market retreat.No one trigger related to the fundamentals of these companies spurred the snap back. As has been the case for years now, these technology giants sit on trillions of dollars in cash, are growing at a breakneck pace and, compared with companies in earlier tech frenzies, do not have absurd valuations.Yet it has been this lack of an identifiable cause — a disappointing earnings result or a major investor’s unloading stock, for example — that has been worrying some market specialists.“There was no real catalyst; I just think there has been a psychological change,” said Julian Emanuel, a stock market strategist with UBS Securities in New York. “Even though the long-term earnings picture with these stocks is favorable, there is discomfort with the disproportionate gains in these stocks.”On Monday, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index closed down 0.5 percent. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was also slightly lower, off 0.1 percent.Netflix helped lead the way, declining 4.2 percent. Apple ended the day down 2.4 percent, with its shares recovering slightly from a 4 percent drop in earlier trading.In the last two trading days, Netflix has lost 8.9 percent while Apple has lost 6.3 percent.The declines for Google and Amazon have been less pronounced. On Monday, Google fell 0.9 percent and Amazon 1.4 percent.To the broader point, UBS published a research report late last week noting that Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google were responsible for one-third of the S.&P. 500’s return of more than 8 percent this year.The bell does not ring at a stock market peak, the note explained, but there have been periods in recent history when investors, after riding a small group of stocks up to unexpected highs, have abandoned them en masse. The reasons for doing so, however, were less than obvious at the time.UBS was not the only major investment firm weighing in late last week about the heavy influence of these stocks in investor portfolios.Goldman Sachs released an analysis that raised concerns about how far these stocks had run, and two investment banks marked down their ratings for Apple, citing worries about slowing iPhone sales.While traders have said hedge funds could be bailing out on these stocks, the larger question is the extent to which retail investors — given how vulnerable they can be to mood shifts in the market — will stick with them.According to FactSet, a data collection company, 82 percent of today’s combined investor exposure to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google is in the hands of large mutual fund companies such as Vanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity and the Capital Group.Hedge funds as an investor class, according to FactSet, hold just $58 billion in these stocks, which are collectively known by the acronym Faang. (Some analysts prefer “Faamg,” substituting larger Microsoft for Netflix.)Compared with the $688 billion held in traditional mutual funds and their faster-growing cousins — exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which trade on stock exchanges — that is a very small figure.To a large degree, the ascendance of these companies is a result of their ability to grow and achieve startling success in a sluggish economy.In the last week, however, a number of analysts have argued that the disconnect between Faang (or Faamg) stocks and other sectors tied more directly to the economy, such as financial and energy stocks, has become too significant to ignore.Credit Suisse, in a trading alert on Monday, recommended that clients ditch QQQ, a $50 billion exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq index, in favor of XLF, a $22 billion E.T.F. that follows large financial companies.In the last week, QQQ has declined by 3.3 percent and XLF has increased by about the same amount as investors large and small have started to make this change."
Trump Administration Says Financial Watchdog Agency Should Be Defanged,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration called for the neutering of many of the central provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act as it offered its most detailed plans to date for the unraveling of the financial regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis.In a report released late Monday, the Treasury Department said the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau should be substantially stripped of its powers, accusing the agency of regulatory overreach and saying the president should be able to remove its director. It also recommended greater exemptions from the so-called Volcker Rule, which bans banks from trading for their own gain, and it called for rules to be revised to give small community banks relief from regulatory scrutiny such as stress tests.“Properly structuring regulation of the U.S. financial system is critical to achieve the administration’s goal of sustained economic growth and to create opportunities for all Americans to benefit from a stronger economy,” said Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.The recommendations were written with an eye toward easing regulations imposed on community banks and all but the largest credit unions after the financial crisis.President Trump asked for the report in February, giving the Treasury Department the authority to restructure major provisions of the Dodd-Frank law, which was passed in 2010. His order directed Mr. Mnuchin to take steps to ensure that the law aligns with the administration’s goals.While the Trump administration cannot roll back the law on its own, the law does give the president broad authority to determine how its rules are executed. Mr. Mnuchin said at a congressional hearing on Monday that the administration could implement many of the changes in the report on its own.The Trump administration is hopeful that Congress will act to further loosen financial regulations. The Treasury report came less than a week after the House passed the Financial Choice Act with the support of only Republicans.If passed, it would exempt some financial institutions that meet capital and liquidity requirements from many of Dodd-Frank’s restrictions on risk-taking. It would also replace Dodd-Frank’s method of dealing with large and failing financial institutions, known as the orderly liquidation authority — which critics say reinforces the idea that some banks are too big to fail — with a new bankruptcy code provision.The Senate is working on its own legislation on financial regulations, but analysts think that passage of a bill is unlikely because Republicans do not have enough votes without help from Democrats, who supported Dodd-Frank.The Trump administration has been supportive of the House bill, although the Treasury report did not go as far as the House plan in some regards. For instance, it would exempt smaller institutions from the Volcker Rule rather than revoking it entirely. The Volcker Rule, a Dodd-Frank provision, bans banks from trading for their own gain and limits ownership in hedge funds and private equity deals.The Trump deregulation plan sets up a clash between Mr. Trump and one of his most vocal Democratic critics: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was her brainchild. Among other approaches to scaling back its power, the Treasury report called for its funding structure to be changed so it is beholden to the annual appropriations process.“The C.F.P.B. was created to pursue an important mission, but its unaccountable structure and unduly broad regulatory powers have led to predictable regulatory abuses and excesses,” the report said. “The C.F.P.B.’s approach to rule making and enforcement has hindered consumer access to credit, limited innovation and imposed unduly high compliance burdens, particularly on small institutions.”The report did not take up many other important financial-regulation issues, but several more reports from the Treasury are due this year. The report did not address reform of the government-controlled mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been in a government conservatorship for nearly nine years.But the report did focus a good deal on the effect of postcrisis regulations on the mortgage market, saying that some of the rules had added costs to the business of servicing mortgages. The report said “increased oversight and regulation has led to an increase in compliance costs,” which limits the ability of mortgage firms to spend more money “on developing more effective mortgage servicing platforms and technology.”The Treasury recommended a slowdown in new regulations for mortgage servicers.Many of the regulations imposed on mortgage servicers came about because of foreclosure abuses during the financial crisis that led big banks to pay tens of billions in fines and restitution.However, the report recommended a number of regulatory changes to spur greater mortgage origination. In particular, the report said, there needs to be “careful study of regulations and the extent to which they may be holding back the supply of mortgage credit.”One recommendation was to revise the definition of what constitutes a “qualified mortgage,” which can be guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to encourage more expansive lending. The report said a loan should be able to meet the criteria “even if one particular criterion is deemed to fall outside the bounds of the existing framework.”The financial industry cheered the Treasury report as a step in the right direction.“Today’s report is an important step towards modernizing America’s financial regulatory system so both economic growth and consumer protection are advanced,” said Tim Pawlenty, chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable.Some of the changes, such as revising the Volcker rule, would largely be a moot point, as banks sold off their proprietary trading desks years ago. While Republicans have generally been in favor of rolling back Dodd-Frank, the plan would open the door to loosening capital requirements they tend to support.Progressive groups condemned the recommendations as proposals that would put the economy at risk and allow the same practices that led to the recession.“The financial crisis had devastating costs for families and communities, and everyday abuses in financial markets cost people tens of billions of dollars a year,” said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform. “Financial reform has made the system safer, and the C.F.P.B. is returning billions of dollars to consumers facing industry tricks and traps.”She added, “We need more effective regulation and enforcement, not rollbacks driven by Wall Street and predatory lenders.”But Mr. Trump has been a vocal critic of financial regulations and has argued that loosening them, along with cutting taxes and renegotiating trade deals, would unleash faster economic growth.In January, Mr. Trump called the financial regulations that President Barack Obama ushered in after the 2008 crisis a “disaster” and promised to “do a big number on Dodd-Frank.”"
"Ed Victor, a Stylish and Frenetic Book Agent, Dies at 77","Ed Victor, a debonair Bronx-born, Cambridge-educated book agent who dazzled London’s fusty literary elite with his star-studded client roster and cheeky deal-making, died on Wednesday in London. He was 77.The cause was complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the Ed Victor Literary Agency in London said.Mr. Victor had been an editor at publishing houses in London and New York when, in 1976, he incautiously quit to open his own literary agency — an inexplicable career move to many of his colleagues, who still viewed book agents as ungentlemanly interlopers.He was vindicated a year later, though, when he sold the rights to Stephen Sheppard’s “The Four Hundred,” a novel about a 19th-century Bank of England caper, in a $1.5 million book and film deal. (The book more or less flopped, and the film was apparently never made, but Mr. Victor collected his 15 percent commission.)In no time his leverage in London was akin to Swifty Lazar’s hold on Hollywood or Andrew Wylie’s sway in New York.A 6-foot-4 bearded bon vivant, Mr. Victor mingled with the glitterati at exclusive parties, where authors might slip him their manuscripts between his favorite vodkas on the rocks with cocktail onions.If anyone doubted that he had become as big a celebrity as some of his clients, Tatler magazine made it official in 1998, when it ranked Mr. Victor second, between Elton John and Mick Jagger, on a list of Britain’s most voguish party guests.His client roster included the novelists Frederick Forsyth, Jack Higgins, Erica Jong, Iris Murdoch, Edna O’Brien, Douglas Adams (“The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy”) and John Banville (winner of the 2005 Man Booker Prize); the journalist Carl Bernstein and the food writer Nigella Lawson; the former prime minister David Cameron; the rock stars Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and Pete Townshend; and the actress Candice Bergen.“People outside the literary world imagine that books get bought and sold by a small group of people who all know each other, and all dine with each other and all weekend at each other’s houses,” Mr. Victor was once quoted as telling another client, the novelist Will Self. “And you know what? It’s true.”He said he applied three tests to determine the potential of a proposed publishing project: “Is the person fabulous? Is the work good? And is there a lot of money in it?”Mr. Victor said he never misled authors. “When I don’t like a book that’s been delivered to me, I don’t — how should I put this — fake an orgasm,” he said.He evaluated proposed books quickly and expected publishers to do the same. He sold the rights to a first novel by Barry Humphries, the Australian comedian best known as his alter ego, Dame Edna, before Mr. Humphries had written a single word.Edward Victor was born in the Bronx on Sept. 9, 1939, to Jewish immigrants from Russia. The family moved to Queens, where his father ran a photographic equipment store.Whatever his parents’ own ambitions, they set no limits for their son. “I grew up perceiving life as a long highway littered with green lights,” he told The Guardian in 2007.After graduating from Bayside High School in Queens, he earned a bachelor’s degree from Dartmouth College and won a Marshall Scholarship to Pembroke College, Cambridge. There he earned a master’s in literature, focusing on the works of George Gissing, Henry James, James Joyce and George Moore.Authors, he said later, “want a killer agent, a shark in the water, not a guy with an MLitt.” Mr. Victor was both.An Anglophile, he married an Englishwoman, Micheline Samuels (later, as a writer, known as Michelene Wandor). Their marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by two sons from that marriage, Adam and Ivan; his second wife, Carol Ryan, and their son, Ryan; and three grandchildren.After college Mr. Victor was hired as an art books editor at the Weidenfeld & Nicolson publishing house in London. Later, after cornering George Weidenfeld, one of the owners, in a bathroom, he won a transfer to the novel division, whose authors included Vladimir Nabokov and Saul Bellow.In 1971 Mr. Victor collaborated with Felix Dennis and Richard Neville in a quixotic, and ultimately unsuccessful, countercultural newspaper venture called Ink.That was followed by a homecoming to the United States, where he briefly worked for Alfred A. Knopf, and a prompt return to England. With two young sons to support, he had decided to try being an agent there.The historian Simon Schama said on Twitter last week that Mr. Victor was “funny, stylish, gossipy, very very shrewd.”Frenetic, too. He was in constant motion, with multiple parties nightly and several homes in Britain, as well as a rebuilt English barn in Bridgehampton, on Long Island. (He said he had lost 40 pounds following his own regimen in a 2001 book he wrote, “The Obvious Diet: Your Personal Way to Lose Weight Fast — Without Changing Your Lifestyle.”)“I’ve always lived a life where people have said: ‘Look at him. Who does he think he is?’” Mr. Victor told The Guardian in 2007. “And who I think I am is someone living life to the brim.”Last year, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to publishing.“What I’m dealing with is like crude oil coming up out of the ground,” he told The Financial Times in 2012, referring to the pool of writing talent.“Creative writing in English can be made into anything, from Vaseline to rocket fuel,” he said. “I can sell film rights, I can sell television rights, I can sell book rights. It’s content, and people need content.”"
