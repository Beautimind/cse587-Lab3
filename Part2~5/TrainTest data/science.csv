Evergreen or Not?,"Q. Why are there brown needles as well as green ones on the average evergreen?A. Somewhat like the hairs on a human head, the needles on a conifer go through cycles of growth and aging before finally dropping off the tree. As the needles age, a certain percentage normally turn brown or yellow at predictable times, usually the older ones farthest from the ends of the growing branches, while the tips stay green.Needle longevity varies markedly from species to species and has also been found to vary somewhat with the environment. For example, most pine needles have a cycle of three to five years, while some juniper needles can last for a decade or more.Research published in 2014 in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that for five species of pines and spruces, individual trees in colder, more northern environments had longer needle life spans.Beyond its normal browning and loss of aging needles, a conifer can also suffer from excess browning, usually most evident in the spring.There are several possible reasons, arborists say, including low soil moisture and dry winds over the winter; rapid temperature fluctuations; damage from road salt; nibbling animals and insects; and air pollution.Watering in summer and fall and mulching over the winter are recommended to protect decorative trees. question@nytimes.com"
Can Carbon Capture Technology Prosper Under Trump?,"THOMPSONS, Tex. — Can one of the most promising — and troubled — technologies for fighting global warming survive during the administration of Donald J. Trump?The technology, carbon capture, involves pulling carbon dioxide out of smokestacks and industrial processes before the climate-altering gas can make its way into the atmosphere. Mr. Trump’s denial of the overwhelming scientific evidence supporting climate change, a view shared by many of his cabinet nominees, might appear to doom any such environmental initiatives.But the new Petra Nova plant about to start running here, about 30 miles southwest of Houston, is a bright spot for the technology’s supporters. It is being completed essentially on time and within its budget, unlike many previous such projects. When it fires up, the plant, which is attached to one of the power company NRG’s hulking coal-burning units, will draw 90 percent of the CO2 from the emissions produced by 240 megawatts of generated power. That is a fraction of the roughly 3,700 megawatts produced at this gargantuan plant, the largest in the Lone Star State. Still, it is enough to capture 1.6 million tons of carbon dioxide each year — equivalent to the greenhouse gas produced by driving 3.5 billion miles, or the CO2 from generating electricity for 214,338 homes.From a tower hundreds of feet above the Petra Nova operation, the carbon capture system looks like a fever dream of an Erector set fanatic, with mazes of pipes and gleaming tanks set off from the main plant’s skyscraping smokestacks and busy coal conveyors. Petra Nova uses the most common technology for carbon capture. The exhaust stream, pushed down a snaking conduit to the Petra Nova equipment, is exposed to a solution of chemicals known as amines, which bond with the carbon dioxide. That solution is pumped to a regenerator, or stripper, which heats the amine and releases the CO2.The gas is drawn off and compressed for further use, and the amine solution is then cycled back through the system to absorb more CO2.Petra Nova, a billion-dollar joint venture of NRG and JX Nippon Oil and Gas Exploration, will not just grab the CO2, it will use it, pushing compressed CO2 through a new pipeline 81 miles to an oil field. The gas will be injected into wells, a technique known as enhanced oil recovery, that should increase production to 15,000 barrels a day from about 300 barrels a day. And since NRG owns a quarter of the oil recovery project, what comes out of the ground will help pay for the carbon capture operation.The plant, which has received $190 million from the federal government, can be economically viable if the price of oil is about $50 a barrel, said David Knox, an NRG spokesman. The company expects to declare the plant operational in January, Mr. Knox said. Aware of problems with carbon capture projects around the country and of the risks of hubris, he said: “We’re not going to declare victory before it’s time.”If the price of oil stabilizes or rises, and if tax breaks for developing the technology continue and markets for carbon storage develop, he said, utilities might ask, “why would I not want to put a carbon capture system on my plant?”But developing large-scale carbon capture has been neither straightforward nor easy. So far, problems have bedeviled major projects, often costing far more than projected and taking longer to complete. The federal government has canceled projects like Future Gen, which was granted more than $1 billion by the Obama administration.Carbon capture systems are not just expensive to build; they tend to be power-hungry, and make the plant less efficient over all — a problem known as “parasitic load.” The Petra Nova carbon capture process gets its energy from a separate power plant constructed for the purpose, which NRG says makes the system more efficient than it would otherwise be, and frees up all of the capacity of the main power plant to sell all of the electricity it produces. The company estimates that the next plant it builds could cost 20 percent less, thanks to lessons learned this time around.If Petra Nova succeeds, it means a boost for carbon capture. Despite carbon capture’s problems, its supporters, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency, call the technology, known as carbon capture sequestration, crucial for meeting emissions standards that can prevent the worst effects of climate change.“If you don’t have C.C.S., the chance of success goes down, and the cost of success goes up,” said Julio Friedmann, an expert at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in California and a former Energy Department official. “If you do have C.C.S., the chance of success goes up and the cost of success goes down.”Carbon capture is proving itself, said David Mohler, the deputy assistant secretary for clean coal and carbon management at the federal Energy Department.Developing technologies often involves delay and cost overruns initially, he said. “You cannot engineer all the bugs out from inside a cubicle — you really have to do this stuff in the real world,” he said.Driving down costs, he noted, is what engineers and businesses do through research, development and production. He cited the plummeting cost of initially expensive technologies like solar power. “We do figure things out as we go,” he said.What the Trump administration will do with carbon capture is, at this point, anyone’s guess. “The technology only makes sense in a world where you are seeking to avoid putting CO2 into the atmosphere,” said Mark Brownstein, a vice president for the climate and energy program at the Environmental Defense Fund.But some supporters of the technology see reasons for hope.“I actually think it’s a moment of optimism,” said Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who met with Mr. Trump last month as a potential agriculture secretary. Ms. Heitkamp co-sponsored legislation  with another Democrat, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, to expand and extend tax breaks for carbon capture projects. “What I saw with the president-elect was a laserlike focus on jobs,” she said. “I think he was intrigued” about the economic opportunity that carbon capture could provide to keep coal power generation in the national mix, she added.One of the pillars of Mr. Trump’s campaign was his intention to revive the fortunes of the coal industry through support of so-called clean coal. And while the exact meaning of the much-used phrase is open to interpretation, it generally includes not just technologies that remove soot and smog-causing pollutants, but also carbon dioxide.Ms. Heitkamp said that businesses, too, were likely to continue development of carbon capture technology, since they planned their plant investments on a curve of decades and are loath to change course because of a single election. “The decision they are making is not, what does the political outlook look like today? What’s it look like over the life of this plant?”Although she concedes that a full-scale revival of coal’s fortunes is unlikely, carbon capture could be a way to extend the life of current facilities while keeping the nation’s energy mix diverse.Jeff Erikson, general manager at the Global C.C.S. Institute, which promotes the technology, said he did not expect to see a great number of new coal plants on the way. “I wouldn’t say carbon capture is going to rescue the coal industry,” he said, but pointed out that there is great potential for applying carbon capture to diverse natural gas plants and to industrial applications. Captured carbon can be used not just for oil production but a widening range of industrial processes, or can even be pumped into the ground.One of the most innovative approaches to carbon capture is being tried 50 miles east of the Petra Nova plant, in La Porte, Tex., where a consortium of companies is trying an entirely new approach to low-carbon power generation.In a $140 million, 50 megawatt demonstration project, the company, Net Power, will use superheated carbon dioxide in much the same way that conventional power plants use steam to drive turbines. This system, invented by a British engineer, Rodney Allam, eliminates the inefficiency inherent in heating water into steam and cooling it again. The power plant produces a stream of very pure, pressurized carbon dioxide that is ready for pipelines without much of the additional processing that conventional carbon capture systems require.The creators say that their technology will produce electric power at a price comparable to combined-cycle power plants, the efficient gas-burning plants that burn gas to power one turbine and then use the excess heat from that process to generate additional power with a steam turbine. That means, in effect, that “the cost of being green is zero,” said Bill Brown, the chief executive of Net Power.“The potential to capture CO2 at no additional cost would be a game changer,” said Fatima Maria Ahmad, a fellow at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a think tank.Net Power combines the resources of Exelon Generation, a power company, the engineering and construction firm CB&I, and 8 Rivers Capital, which developed the technology used in the project. The centerpiece of the project is a special turbine built by Toshiba and designed for the punishingly high pressure used in the process. And while any system that so closely resembles a rocket engine has the potential for what engineers delicately refer to as a RUD — “rapid unplanned disassembly” — those working directly on the project say they have designed safety features that give them confidence.Even if the United States government shows little interest in reducing the nation’s carbon footprint under Mr. Trump and a Republican Congress, consortium officials say they expect to find ready customers from companies in the United States and around the globe, where the threat of climate change is fully acknowledged. “We see this very much playing into all parts of the world,” said Daniel McCarthy, executive vice president for CB&I’s technology operating group.Environmentalists remain divided on the issue of carbon capture, said John Coequyt, global climate policy director for Sierra Club. “This is the issue where the biggest range of positions exists within the environmental community,” he said. Groups like the Clean Air Task Force favor it strongly. Other factions call clean coal a fig leaf to keep coal, with all of its environmental baggage, in the energy mix. And many suggest the billions of dollars spent on trying to capture carbon would be better directed to the technologies that don’t pollute the atmosphere in the first place.Dr. Friedmann, the former energy official, predicted that the technology would prove its usefulness. “It’s convenient to just say ‘Keep it in the ground,’ ” he said, referring to an antifossil-fuel slogan. “What I prefer to say is ‘Keep it from the air.’”"
An Inspiring Story of Weight Loss and Its Aftermath,"The adornments in the office of Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, are hardly typical: a full-size refrigerator stocked with fresh fruits and vegetables; a work station where he prepares and blends these plant-based ingredients for his meals and snacks; and a convection oven and hot plate where he cooks them.In an adjacent anteroom, there’s a stationary bike, 15-pound weights, a multipurpose fitness tower and a TRX suspension trainer hanging on the door. His laptop is mounted on a music stand so he can use it while working out on a mini-stepper.Eight months ago, Mr. Adams learned during a health checkup for abdominal pain that he had Type 2 diabetes. He said his average blood sugar level was so high that the doctor was surprised he had not already lapsed into a coma. His hemoglobin A1C level — a lab test that shows the average level of blood glucose over the previous three months — was 17 percent, about three times normal. He wasted no time in tackling his disease with fervor. Spurning the American tendency to treat every ailment with medication, he instead explored the body’s ability to heal itself.Mr. Adams, a 56-year-old former police captain, now needs a new publicity photo. He no longer resembles the roly-poly image on official posters. By adopting a vegan diet, preparing his own meals and working exercise into his everyday routines, he’s shed 30 pounds and completely reversed his diabetes, a pancreatic disorder that can lead to heart attacks, stroke, nerve damage, kidney disease, visual loss and cognitive impairment. Within three months, his A1C level was down to a normal 5.7.He now strives to inform his millions of constituents about how to counter this health- and life-robbing disease, which has reached epidemic proportions in this country, even among children. Starting on the home front, he stripped the Brooklyn Borough Hall drink machine of sugary beverages and the snack machine of everything cooked in oil or unnaturally sweetened. Those searching for a pick-me-up can indulge in plain or sparkling water, diet soda, nuts, dried fruit, protein bars and whole-grain baked chips.“I loved salt and sugar and often used candy to revive me when I felt lethargic,” Mr. Adams confessed. “But I discovered the human palate is amazingly adaptable, and after two weeks without salt or sugar, I no longer craved them.” With his new lifestyle, he said he has so much energy he no longer needs an edible midday pick-me-up.He also makes his own “ice cream” — really a fruit sorbet made with a gadget called Yonanas, a frozen dessert maker that can produce an all-fruit, dairy-free facsimile of frozen yogurt with no added sweetener. I have the same gadget — I love it, too, and often serve the fruit desserts to the delight of company.Although Mr. Adams now eats nothing “that has a face, mother or father,” he said he knows most people at risk of Type 2 diabetes will not abandon all animal foods, sugary sweeteners and refined starches or become exercise fanatics. “But we’ve got to focus on how to wean people off their bad eating habits — the same way we wean people off addictive drugs — and how to work physical activity into their everyday lives.”A new study on the harms of sedentary living published in the journal Diabetologia found that breaking up sitting with short bouts of standing and light-intensity walking was even more effective than an equivalent amount of a concentrated traditional exercise (in this case, cycling) in controlling the blood sugar of patients with Type 2 diabetes.Rather than proselytize, Mr. Adams prefers to teach by example, introducing people to healthy foods and providing helpful information. “I don’t want to become an annoying vegan,” he said. “My hope is that by having people focus on adding healthy things to their plates, rather than unhealthy things, they’ll eventually only have room for the healthy ones.”Mr. Adams hopes to encourage more people to make “reasonable alterations” in how they eat and move through a series of initiatives, including a newsletter, a cookbook of healthful recipes, community and business events that incorporate healthy eating, speaking engagements and fliers distributed to the public at train stations. He’s also planning a competition for schoolchildren to identify the most effective way to go from soil to plate with wholesome foods.“At every event, I talk about how health is the cornerstone to our prosperity,” he said. The changes he’s made in his eating and exercise habits have done a lot more than reverse his diabetes. “All my numbers improved in just three months,” he said, including his blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which are now in a healthy range, thereby lowering his risk for heart disease and stroke.He bemoans the dependence of most Americans on processed foods and meals prepared by many stores and restaurants that are laden with unhealthful ingredients. Relying on such foods not only can be bad for your health; it also deprives people of a “spiritual relationship” with the foods they eat, he said. “I never cooked before; now I love cooking, and I’ve become very creative in my cooking ability.” He has learned to add spices like cinnamon, oregano, turmeric and cloves into many of the foods he makes. “Food should be tasteful and enjoyable,” and it can be without using sugar, salt and fat, he maintains.Most patients with Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, are prescribed medication to reduce the amount of blood sugar released by the liver and enhance the body’s sensitivity to insulin. But even though there is no known cure for Type 2 diabetes, lifestyle factors can have a big impact. Numerous studies have demonstrated that losing weight (for those who are overweight), eating a diet low in refined carbohydrates and sugar, and being more active can reduce a person’s dependence on medications and sometimes eliminate any need for drugs.A loss of just 5 percent to 10 percent of body weight can often control the disease in people who are overweight. Among people who are obese, going on a very low calorie diet or inducing extreme weight loss through bariatric surgery often can reverse the disorder. In one small study in England, Type 2 diabetes went into remission in nearly half the people who consumed a very low-calorie liquid diet for eight weeks and stayed in remission for six months after they resumed normal eating.However, for most people, the changes they make in their eating and exercise habits to control or reverse diabetes must be maintained indefinitely to keep the disease at bay."
Petroleum Jelly May Reduce Risk of Eczema,"Applying inexpensive petroleum jelly to a new baby daily for the first six months of life may reduce the risk that the infant will develop eczema, which can be a lifelong torment, according to a new analysis.Two studies done in newborns with relatives suffering from atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema, showed that rubbing moisturizer into their skin daily lowered their risk of developing the itchy, dry, scaly patches on their heads, arms and legs that characterize the disease.Scientists at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine looked at seven common moisturizers and decided that petroleum jelly was the cheapest effective one; sunflower oil came in second.Eczema affects over 10 percent of American children, and is more common in those with dark brown skin. Its prevalence in Africa is unknown, but anecdotally it is thought to be increasing there too.The cause is also unknown, but it is often associated with allergies and with asthma, which is also more common among African-American children, and can be fatal. Itchiness often keeps children from sleeping, and scratching can lead to skin infections. Some poor families spend large sums on expensive creams to fight the disease. The study’s authors argued that health insurance should cover moisturizers.The theory is that moisturizers “seal” a baby’s skin against some invader that triggers inflammation.Bigger studies that last beyond infancy must be done to prove the concept, said Dr. Steve Xu, a dermatologist at the Feinberg School and lead author of the analysis published by JAMA Pediatrics last month. But, he said, the risk of moisturizing is minimal.“We’re not giving them an oral drug or injecting them with a medication,” he said. “We’re putting Vaseline on these babies to potentially prevent a very devastating disease.”"
Is Your Workout Not Working? Maybe You’re a Non-Responder,"Is your workout getting you nowhere?Research and lived experience indicate that many people who begin a new exercise program see little if any improvement in their health and fitness even after weeks of studiously sticking with their new routine.Among fitness scientists, these people are known as “nonresponders.” Their bodies simply don’t respond to the exercise they are doing. And once discouraged, they often return to being nonexercisers.But an inspiring and timely new study suggests that nonresponders to one form of exercise can probably switch to another exercise regimen to which their body will respond. And a simple test you can do at home will help you determine how well your workout is working for you.One of the first major studies to report the phenomenon of nonresponders appeared in 2001, when researchers parsed data from dozens of previously published studies of running, cycling and other endurance exercise.The studies showed that, on aggregate, endurance training increased people’s endurance. But when the researchers examined individual outcomes, the variations were staggering. Some people had improved their endurance by as much as 100 percent, while others had actually become less fit, even though they were following the same workout routine.Age, sex and ethnicity had not mattered, the researchers noted. Young people and old had been outliers, as had women and men, black volunteers and white. Interestingly, nonresponse to endurance training ran in families, the researchers discovered, suggesting that genetics probably plays a significant role in how people’s bodies react to exercise.Since then, other researchers have found that people can have extremely erratic reactions to weight training regimens, with some packing on power and mass and others losing both.And a study published last year concentrating on brief bouts of intense interval training concluded that some people barely gained endurance with this type of workout, while others flourished, greatly augmenting their fitness.These studies, however, were not generally designed to tell us whether someone who failed to benefit from one form of exercise might do well with another.So for the new experiment, which was published in December in the journal PLOS One, researchers from Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, and the University of Ottawa decided to focus intently on whether a nonresponder to one form of exercise could benefit by switching to another.They began by gathering 21 healthy men and women and determining their VO2 max, a measure of how much oxygen the lungs can deliver to the muscles; heart rates; and other physiological parameters related to aerobic fitness.Then they had each volunteer complete two very different types of workouts. Each training regimen lasted three weeks, and the researchers waited several months before starting the next regimen, so that volunteers could return to their baseline fitness.One three-week routine involved typical endurance training: riding a stationary bicycle four times a week for 30 minutes at a moderately strenuous pace.The second type of exercise revolved around high-intensity intervals. Each volunteer completed eight 20-second intervals of very hard pedaling on a stationary bicycle, with 10 seconds of rest after each bout. The intervals were brutal but brief.At the end of each three-week session, the researchers again checked each volunteer’s VO2 max and other fitness measures.As a group, they had gained admirable amounts of fitness from both workouts and to about the same extent.But individually, the responses varied considerably.About a third of the people had failed to show much if any improvement in one of the measures of fitness after three weeks of endurance training. Similarly, about a third had not improved their fitness much with interval training. And after each type of workout, some participants were found to be in worse shape.A majority of the participants, in other words, had failed to respond as expected after one of the workouts.But, importantly, no one had failed to respond at all. Every man and woman had measurably improved his or her fitness in some way after one of the sessions, if not the other.Those who had shown little response to endurance training generally showed a robust improvement after the interval sessions, and vice versa.These data suggest that “there is no one-size-fits-all approach to exercise,” says Brendon Gurd, an associate professor of kinesiology at Queen’s University who oversaw the study. “But it does seem as if there is some size that fits everyone.”The question is how to determine which form of exercise best fits you.The answer, Dr. Gurd says, is simple trial and error.Before beginning a new exercise routine, he says, measure your fitness. You can do this by briskly walking up several flights of stairs or quickly stepping onto and off a box three or four times. Then check your pulse. This is your baseline number.Now start working out. Walk. Jog. Attend interval training or spin classes.After about a month, Dr. Gurd says, repeat the stair or step test. Your pulse rate should be slower now. Your workout sessions should also be feeling easier.If not, you may be a nonresponder to your current exercise routine.In that case, switch things up, Dr. Gurd recommends. If you have primarily been walking, maybe try sprinting up a few flights of stairs and walking back down, which is a simple form of interval training.Or if you have been exercising with intervals and feeling no fitter, perhaps jog for a month or two.The message he hopes people will glean from his and other studies of exercise nonresponders “is not that you shouldn’t bother exercising because exercise might not help you,” Dr. Gurd says. “It does help everyone, once you find your own best exercise.”"
Pregnancy Complication Tied to Eye Problems Later in Life,"Pre-eclampsia — the pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and potential organ damage — is linked to eye problems in the mother later in life, new research has found.Canadian researchers tracked more than a million women who delivered babies in Quebec between 1989 and 2013, of whom 64,350 were given a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. Then they followed them using hospital discharge data over the years. The study is in Obstetrics and Gynecology.After adjusting for age, socioeconomic status, diabetes, hypertension, obesity and other factors that can affect the eyes, they found that compared with women who did not have pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, those who did had 1.6 times the risk of retinal detachment and nearly double the risk of other diseases of the retina. The increase in risk began right after delivery and grew steadily over 15 years of follow-up. Women with pre-eclampsia early in pregnancy were at greater risk than those whose pre-eclampsia began later.“Pre-eclampsia is a good indicator of chronic disease later in life” for the mother, said the lead author, Dr. Nathalie Auger, of the University of Montreal Hospital Research Center. “Those women who have had pre-eclampsia should begin to adopt healthy lifestyles to help reduce their risk of chronic disease, including the risk of eye disease.”"
Iron Deficiency Anemia Tied to Hearing Loss,"Iron deficiency anemia may be linked to hearing loss, new research has found.Researchers studied 305,339 men and women ages 21 to 90, of whom 4,807 had hearing loss and 2,274 had iron deficiency anemia.Hearing loss was more prevalent among women in the sample, and after adjusting for sex, the researchers found the risk for hearing loss was nearly two and a half times as high in those with anemia.The risk for sensorineural hearing loss, the type linked to problems in the nerves of the inner ear, was 82 percent higher in those deficient in iron. There was an insignificant increase in risk for those with conductive hearing loss, caused by a problem in the ear canal, eardrum or bones of the middle ear. The study is in JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery. Many cases of hearing loss have no known cause.Although the reason for the association remains unknown, animal studies suggest that iron deficiency may reduce blood flow to the inner ear, affecting the cochlear ganglion, the group of nerve cells that transmit sound to the brain.“Our study does not say that iron deficiency causes hearing loss, but only that there is a link between the two,” said the lead author, Kathleen M. Schieffer, a doctoral candidate at Pennsylvania State University. “I would not recommend that anyone take iron supplements prophylactically without consulting a physician.”"
"On Long Migrations, Birds Chase an Eternal Spring","Bird migrations have stumped the greatest minds for thousands of years. Aristotle thought that the robins living in Greece in the winter somehow turned into redstarts in the summer. In fact, robins migrate from Greece to Northern Europe around the time redstarts arrive from Africa.Scientists have gotten a much better understanding of bird migration in recent centuries, but there’s a tremendous amount they have yet to learn. After tracking more than three dozen birds with sensors for thousands of miles, a team of researchers reported on Wednesday that their migration defied the expected course.Instead of simply flying straight from their summer grounds in Denmark to their winter site in Africa, the birds stretched out their journey, stopping at several places along the way for weeks at a time.“It’s more of a nomadic life,” said Kasper Thorup, a bird migration expert at the University of Copenhagen and co-author of the new study. “They hardly have a place to call home.”The journey was exquisitely well timed to coincide with high levels of vegetation at each site, he and his colleagues found. These habits, honed by thousands of years of evolution, probably helped them enjoy a good diet of insects on their trip. This may be a common strategy among the world’s migratory birds, but Dr. Thorup and his colleagues warn that it may be threatened by climate change.Previous generations of researchers could rely only on indirect clues to the travels of birds. Traditionally, ornithologists caught a bird at its summer breeding grounds, put an identifying band on its leg, and then waited for someone to spot it wherever it ended up for the winter. Such studies said little about where the birds went between points A and B.Today’s migration researchers are finally filling in some of those gaps. Some are analyzing millions of crowdsourced bird sightings. Others are fitting birds with miniature tracking devices.“We have all these resources coming online, and so we can replace speculation with observation,” said Frank A. La Sorte, a research associate at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology.In 2002, the Cornell lab started a program called eBird with the Audubon Society. Amateurs fill out an online form each time they go birding, noting all the species they spot. Dr. La Sorte and his colleagues analyze the records, tracking a number of migratory birds that travel through North America each year.The researchers have found that birds migrate in loops, rather than follow a straight line north and south. In summer, birds heading to eastern North America, for instance, catch tailwinds that help them get over the Gulf of Mexico.The birds end up drifting to the west, but they still save energy despite the longer route. On the way back south, though, they take a more direct path across the Gulf.In western North America, food plays a big part in the migration loop. Birds fly at night and then land to feed on insects during the day. In the spring, their routes take them to places where plants have put on a lot of growth. That’s probably also where the birds can find insect larvae to eat.While eBird gives Dr. La Sorte information about millions of birds, it can show him only what birders are seeing. Other researchers are suiting up small squadrons of birds with tracking devices to follow them through their entire migrations.For the new study, published in the journal Science Advances, Dr. Thorup and his colleagues put lightweight devices on common cuckoos. As the birds migrated between Denmark and Central Africa, they sent signals to satellites showing their location.The researchers also tracked two smaller migratory species traveling from Denmark to sub-Saharan Africa: thrush nightingales and red-backed shrikes. These birds are too small to carry the weight of satellite transmitters, so Dr. Thorup and his colleagues fitted them with even tinier devices called geo-locators.These sensors record only sunlight levels throughout each day. When the birds returned to Denmark, the scientists recovered the geo-locators and used each day’s data to plot the birds’ routes.Studying 38 birds in total, the scientists found the animals didn’t move directly from their summer grounds to their winter grounds. Instead, the birds would fly for a few days, stop somewhere for a few weeks, and then move on again.Red-backed shrikes, for example, leave Denmark and reach southeast Europe in August. In October, they go to East Africa. By December, they’re in southern Africa. And in April, they’re back in East Africa again.Throughout their journey, the scientists found, the three species timed their flights so that they reached feeding grounds once they were abundant with vegetation. Dr. Thorup suspects that the birds are able to make meals of local insect larvae feeding on the plants.The new data show that even though the birds ended up in the same places in Africa, they sometimes followed different routes. Dr. La Sorte and his colleagues have found similar flexibility in North American birds, which often adjust their route and speed when over the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic Ocean, perhaps to cope with changing weather conditions.It’s possible that birds somehow combine short-range flexibility with a navigation system, hard-wired into the brain, that guides them to the places where they can find the most food to eat.“You don’t cross the Sahara without knowing it’s good on the other side,” said Dr. Thorup.That strategy works well when birds can be sure to find food at the same place at the same time each year. But climate change is altering the calculus.In Northern Europe and North America, for example, plants are greening up earlier in the spring. In Africa, rainfall patterns are shifting, changing the times at which plants put on new leaves and fruit.Dr. Thorup and his colleagues compared the migration routes of the birds to computer projections of how ecosystems will change in response to global warming over the next few decades.They concluded that climate change may make migrations much harder on the birds.In the summer, for instance, they will need to fly farther north to find food. “And when they arrive in Africa, there are no obvious places for them to go,” said Dr. Thorup.Of course, birds have not migrated along the same paths for millions of years. Ice age glaciers gradually retreated from places like Denmark only about 11,000 years ago, allowing birds to colonize them for summer breeding.But this change in bird migration was probably the result of natural selection acting on hundreds of generations of birds. Human-driven climate change is moving much more quickly.“We’re worried that they won’t have the time to adapt,” Dr. Thorup said."
Bats Like Their Plant Nectar Sweet — Though Maybe the Plants Know Better,"This is how we’re taught to count as children: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Yet our innate grasp of quantities isn’t linear. We’re more likely to experience the world in ratios, like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. It’s easier for us to see the difference between one and two marbles than 15 and 16 of them.In this way, we’re a lot like certain types of bats who have shaped the evolution of the plants they pollinate by making proportional judgments about what they’re willing to eat. That’s the finding of a study published in Science on Thursday. The study set out to answer an old evolutionary riddle: How do plants pollinated by bats get away with offering nectar in much lower sugar concentrations than the bats prefer? It turns out the plants are just giving the bats what they appear to want.Given a choice through experiments, bats choose syrupy nectars, with 60 percent sugar — but the plants they pollinate in the wild produce watery nectars with 20 percent sugar.“Maybe it’s the plants enforcing a dilute nectar that they prefer on the animals — or maybe it’s the bats exerting selection pressure,” said York Winter, a professor of cognitive neurobiology at Humboldt University, and one of the study’s authors.To figure out which scenario was happening, his team ran evolution simulations in the field, on the computer and in the lab, assuming that the bats were choosing certain plants to pollinate over others.Combining these simulations, the researchers found an explanation for how nectar-feeding bats end up preferring nectars that are less sweet — particularly when there’s fierce competition for a limited amount of nectar. The crux of that explanation? The same kind of nonlinear, proportional decision making that people use in many everyday judgments.This pattern is encapsulated by the Weber-Fechner law, which says that animals — including people — commonly perceive physical stimuli in relative increments rather than absolutes.Given one type of input, the Weber-Fechner law is relatively straightforward. But when you’re forced to deal with multiple considerations, like trying to simultaneously judge prices and sizes of cereal boxes at the grocery store, the effect becomes more complicated. Which factor will stand out more, and therefore carry more weight in your decision making?Nectar-feeding bats also consider two things at the same time: the volume of available nectar, and its sugar concentration. They prefer high levels of both, but in the wild, nectar sugar concentrations are generally midrange, while volumes per bat are low, especially when many thirsty bats are competing for limited supplies.The Weber-Fechner law dictates that the bats perceive increases in volume more acutely than they do increases in sugar concentration. In other words, they are more sensitive to changes in quantity than in quality.“Gaining just a little bit more nectar causes a much stronger change in sensation — so they go to flowers where they get a little bit more nectar,” Dr. Winter said.Over many iterations, the researchers’ simulations confirmed, the bats help pollinate plants that produce more nectar, even if that nectar is more watery and less sugary.Dr. Winter is intrigued by the possibility of applying these findings to human behavior. How do people make decisions when they have to take into account multiple factors?“Multiple dimensions can interact and cause nonrational decisions, where you are given two options and you actually take the lesser one,” Dr. Winter said.Consider that a proportional sense of quantities is what sometimes leads people to expend more effort saving $5 on a $10 purchase than $10 on a $100 purchase.So, the next time you find yourself defaulting to rough estimates, you may want to stop and disentangle your perceptual biases. Take this lesson from nectar-feeding bats: It’s all relative, until the only nectar that’s left for you to drink is watery."
"Endangered Species and the Stuff We Buy, All Mapped Out","The things that people buy and consume can have deadly consequences for the planet’s wildlife. Now a series of maps show where it’s hurting the most.Daniel Moran, an industrial ecologist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and his colleague Keiichiro Kanemoto from Shinshu University in Japan, developed the maps for a paper published on Wednesday in Nature Ecology & Evolution to illustrate the impact of what they call a biodiversity footprint. Dr. Moran sees this idea as an early step toward creating tools that will allow nations to one day regulate biodiversity through trade, as some currently do with carbon.People like stuff, but unsustainable sourcing of that stuff has been damaging to the planet’s biodiversity. In the last 500 years, around 1,000 animals that we know of have gone extinct, mainly because of habitat destruction. Estimates vary, but the rate of extinction today is somewhere between 100 and 1,000 times as high as it was when humans didn’t exist, scientists say.To visualize the link between global trade and its environmental impact, the maps connect the supply chains of traded commodities in 187 countries with 6,803 animals classified as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and BirdLife International. It looked at the 166 threats stemming from human activity that affect each animal and tracked where commodities resulting from that activity eventually end up.The regions with the biggest impact were the United States, the European Union and Japan. The European Union and the United States pose especially big threats to marine life in Southeast Asia, where wildlife has been hit hard by nearly every country in the world. In the areas most under threat, rich biodiversity converges with heavy economic activity. Generally, that excludes the United States and Europe, where biodiversity has already been heavily reduced by human populations.To help reduce the damage, consumers can demand more sustainably sourced goods with adequate labeling, Dr. Moran said. Most of the impact comes from food and fiber products like palm oil, unsustainably produced coffee and tea, paper, lumber, and cotton.But the map has its limits, and doesn’t track the density of threats to any specific species tied to any particular production site."
"To Rate How Smart Dogs Are, Humans Learn New Tricks","Pam Giordano thinks her dog is quite intelligent, and she has proof: Giorgio, an 11-year-old Havanese, has diplomas stating he has a bachelor’s, master’s and Ph.D. from Yale. The bumper sticker on Ms. Giordano’s car announces, “My dog made it to the Ivy League.”The honors were bestowed on Giorgio and Giuliana, his sibling, for participating in the university’s Canine Cognition Center. “I wanted to know how much they know and how smart they are,” Ms. Giordano, a real estate broker in Branford, Conn., said. “I think Giuliana really just goes for the treats. But Giorgio rises above it. He is very bright. I would say he knows over 100 words.”The Yale researchers are on to something. They have figured out how to tap into the willingness of dogs’ human companions to support their studies. Enthusiastically.Suddenly how smart your dog is seems to matter — an aspiration that has also not gone unnoticed by the commercial pet industry. Walk into any pet supply chain, such as the aptly named PetSmart, and take in the toys, gadgets and foods advertised as optimizing a dog’s intelligence. Or just do an online search for “brain games to play with your dog.”The swelling interest, eagerly amplified by the pet industry, has given a boost to the relatively new academic field of canine cognition, with research centers sprouting up on campuses across the country. In the fall, the journal Current Directions in Psychological Science devoted an issue to the topic.At Yale, the three-year-old canine cognition center has been barraged by humans eager to have their dogs’ intelligence evaluated, volunteering them for research exercises and puzzles. Some owners drive for hours.“People like their kids to be smart, and they like their dogs to be smart,” said Laurie Santos, a professor of psychology who directs the center. “Some people will call and sound apologetic, saying, ‘I’d like to bring my dog in, but he might be too dumb.’”(By the way, here’s a bubble-bursting secret: Smart dogs often aren’t that great to live with, precisely because they’re too smart.)But when owners use “smart” and “dog” in the same sentence, what exactly do they mean? Smart compared with what? A cat? Another dog? A human?Scientists define and measure a dog’s smarts differently from the way owners do. Over a decade ago, evolutionary anthropologists realized that in the dog, whose development has been so strongly shaped by humans, they had a star subject to observe. Unlike gorillas, dogs are fairly inexpensive to study — their numbers are plentiful, their room and board happily covered by owners.Now some researchers are studying the dog’s brain. Others are trying to identify the dog’s cognitive abilities, debating about the extent to which dogs may be unique among animals. Comparative psychologists are looking at how those capacities stack up against those of children.Experts agree that when owners discuss how smart their dogs are, they are imposing a human construct on an animal. A dog may seem “smarter” to its owner than the neighbor’s dog, but even the popular notion derived from some studies — that dogs are as intelligent as toddlers — is, practically speaking, meaningless.Many animal behaviorists say that what people really mean when they call a dog smart is that the dog is highly trainable.“People think dogs are more intelligent than cats because they obey,” said Frans de Waal, a biologist and primatologist at Emory University in Atlanta. “But it’s not the same thing.”Dogs have lived in intimate proximity with people for some 30,000 years, evolving along the way to pick up human cues and training us to feel obliged to feed and house them. As survival instincts go, that is pretty smart.Canine cognition research is underway on campuses from Berkeley to Barnard, and at universities in England, Hungary and Japan. The field’s growth has coincided with a shift in how dog owners view their animals.“This is the logical consequence of the ‘humanization of pets’ trend,” said Hal Herzog, an anthrozoologist and emeritus professor of psychology at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, N.C. Indeed, owners are often referred to as pet parents.Like human parents who bought Baby Einstein CDs, hoping to enhance the intelligence of offspring even in utero, many pet owners succumb to gadgets advertised as enhancing their dog’s brain function. (See: IQ Treat Ball.)“What parent doesn’t want their child to have the best cognitive stimuli you can give?” said David Lummis, senior pet market analyst with Packaged Facts, a market research firm. “Guilt is a big part of it.”But as some pet parents discover, a smart dog can seem less like an adorable toddler than a know-it-all teenager.“Smart dogs are often a nuisance,” said Clive D. L. Wynne, a psychology professor who directs the Canine Science Collaboratory at Arizona State University. “They get restless, bored and create trouble.”Though enthusiasm for canine research is fevered, funding can be hard to come by. Recently, some researchers have locked arms with commerce, to attract so-called citizen scientists (a.k.a. dog owners) to help collect data.Adam Miklosi, a prominent Hungarian canine behavioral researcher, plans to connect scientists with pet owners who can gather information about their dogs’ habits. His venture, SensDog, uses an iPhone app to communicate with Apple Watch sensors in the animal’s collar.Then there’s Dognition, whose website professes to “Find the Genius in Your Dog.” It’s a project led by Brian Hare of Duke University’s Canine Cognition Center in partnership with Purina Pro Plan’s Bright Mind line of dog foods. For $19, owners receive a questionnaire and video instructions to gather information about their dog and submit the data on Dognition’s website. Dognition then sends back a cognitive profile of the pet, especially in comparison with other dogs. More than 25,000 owners have submitted data so far.Of course, we are still generally talking about dogs as a species. While stereotypes of breeds are deeply rooted, Dr. Hare said, there is no evidence to show that one breed is cognitively superior to another. But in 1999, Stanley Coren, now an emeritus psychologist at the University of British Columbia, produced a list of 110 breeds ranked by intelligence, based on his survey of some 200 professional dog-obedience judges. The top three: Border collie, then poodle followed by German shepherd.“Giorgio is one-third poodle, so he’s really smart a third of the time,” Ms. Giordano asserted.(Skulking down at the bottom of the list: bulldog, Basenji, Afghan hound. If it is any consolation, Dr. Hare said scientists did not consider surveys to be definitive proof.)Certain dogs excel at tasks for which they have been bred for centuries. Bloodhounds have an astonishing sense of smell. Australian shepherds can keep a flock of sheep together as skillfully as a nursery school teacher with a playground full of 3-year-olds.And, distinctively, dogs seem to trust us for problem-solving help. When they are flummoxed (for example, the rubber ball becomes stuck under a bed, the kitchen door shuts), they turn to their humans, yipping, pawing, gazing dolefully. A wolf reared by a human, by contrast, will just keep trying to solve the problem on its own.But intelligence per se may not be the trait that truly sets dogs apart, at least in human-animal interaction, researchers say.“There is something remarkable about dogs,” said Dr. Wynne, who is studying how to train dogs to sniff for bomb-making ingredients. “They have this kind of open hyper-sociability. The dog itself wants to give out love.“I think ‘smarts’ is a red herring,” he continued. “What we really need in our dogs is affection. My own dog is an idiot, but she’s a lovable idiot.”Dr. Hare, who is an associate professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke, said he believed that dogs, like humans, had multiple types of intelligence. With Dognition, owners test their dogs in areas of empathy, communication, cunning, memory and reasoning.Dr. Santos of Yale agrees. “If you want to train an agility dog or a show dog, you value certain traits,” she said. “And if you have a stressful job and a family, you want a companion to cuddle. But they’re both ‘smart.’”Chaser, a Border collie known for understanding over 1,000 words, is often labeled the smartest dog in the world. She had some intriguing results on Dognition, Dr. Hare said.Researchers placed 10 items that Chaser could already identify in a pile with an unfamiliar one. Then they asked her to fetch the one that she had not yet learned. She did so correctly because she inferred it was the only object she did not recognize, researchers said. A week later, when asked to retrieve the same item, Chaser remembered.On Dognition, in areas of inference and memory, Chaser unsurprisingly scored off the charts, Dr. Hare said.But as for Chaser’s results in empathy and communication, qualities that owners do cherish in their dogs, Dr. Hare said the dog was “totally uninteresting.”Still, while Dr. Hare endorses a complex view of canine intelligence, he could not resist a one-upmanship jab familiar to parents, both of humans and pets, who yearn to place their progeny at top-tier universities.“You know about grade inflation in the Ivies,” he said, noting that at Duke, “your dog has to come to our center at least four times to get an undergraduate degree.”“But,” he added, “only once to get a certificate at Yale.”"
Hooked on Our Smartphones,"The many men, women and children who spend their days glued to their smartphones and social media accounts might learn something from Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of the groundbreaking megahit “Hamilton.” Asked in an interview with Delta Sky magazine when and where he finds time to be creative, Mr. Miranda, an avid reader of books and enthusiast for unfettered downtime, replied: “The good idea comes in the moment of rest. It comes in the shower. It comes when you’re doodling or playing trains with your son. ‘Hamilton’ forced me to double down on being awake to the inspirations of just living my life.”Mr. Miranda’s observation bodes ill for the future, not just of creativity but also of healthy bodies, minds and relationships. No doubt you’ve seen the following scenarios, probably many times:• Young couples out to dinner pull out their smartphones to check messages, emails and social networks even before scanning the menu, and check their phones repeatedly throughout the meal.• Shoppers and commuters standing in line, people crossing busy streets, even cyclists and drivers whose eyes are on their phones instead of their surroundings.• Toddlers in strollers playing with a digital device — a parent’s or perhaps even their own — instead of observing and learning from the world around them.• People walking down the street with eyes on their phones, bumping into others, tripping over or crashing into obstacles.Observations like these have prompted a New York psychotherapist to ask, “What really matters?” in life. In her enlightening new book, “The Power of Off,” Nancy Colier observes that “we are spending far too much of our time doing things that don’t really matter to us.” Both in and outside her practice, she has encountered many people who have become “disconnected from what really matters, from what makes us feel nourished and grounded as human beings.”The near-universal access to digital technology, starting at ever younger ages, is transforming modern society in ways that can have negative effects on physical and mental health, neurological development and personal relationships, not to mention safety on our roads and sidewalks.Don’t get me wrong. I’m no Luddite. I love technology. I love the convenience and assistance afforded by the myriad apps on my cellphone, a pocket-size information bank. I remember being amazed, as a Times reporter back in the early 1980s, when I started using word processing and realized how much faster I could write an article. Now computers save tons of time and effort and avert countless embarrassing errors because I can look up facts, figures, spelling, definitions and scholarly publications without leaving my ergonomic chair.But I also love putting my computer in sleep mode and going for a walk with my dog, meeting and chatting with friends, acquaintances and strangers, some of whom have become friends.As with so much else in life, moderation in our digital world should be the hallmark of a healthy relationship with technology. Too many of us have become slaves to the devices that were supposed to free us, giving us more time to experience life and the people we love. Instead, we’re constantly bombarded by bells, buzzes and chimes that alert us to messages we feel compelled to view and respond to immediately.“Most people now check their smartphones 150 times per day, or every six minutes,” Ms. Colier wrote. “And young adults are now sending an average of 110 texts per day.” Furthermore, she added, “46 percent of smartphone users now say that their devices are something they ‘couldn’t live without.’”In “The World Unplugged Project,” investigators at the University of Maryland reported that “a clear majority” of students in the 10 countries studied experienced distress when they tried to go without their devices for 24 hours. One in three people admitted they’d rather give up sex than their smartphones.I fear we are turning into digital robots. Will future generations know how to converse with one another face to face? Will they notice the birds, trees, sunrise and the people with whom they share the planet?Instead of visiting art galleries, attending concerts or walking on picturesque wooded paths, one woman I know who came to Woodstock, N.Y., last summer spent the weekend on her iPad communing with her many “friends” on Facebook. All I could think was “What a waste!”Why, you may ask, is it so important to limit our digital lives? “Without open spaces and downtime, the nervous system never shuts down — it’s in constant fight-or-flight mode,” Ms. Colier said in an interview. “We’re wired and tired all the time. Even computers reboot, but we’re not doing it.”She continued, “It’s connections to other human beings — real-life connections, not digital ones — that nourish us and make us feel like we count. Our presence, our full attention is the most important thing we can give each other. Digital communications don’t result in deeper connections, in feeling loved and supported.”How often is your real work interrupted by signals from your smartphone that you find impossible to ignore? Have you ever avoided intimacy with your partner because you’re in the midst of iPhone Scrabble? Is endlessly snapping selfies and posting your every action and thought on social media creating an unhealthy self-centeredness?As for physical well-being, every hour spent on a device is likely to be an indoor, sedentary one. Screens are stealing time that children and adolescents should be spending on physical activity and sports, reading, or creating and engaging directly with other children, all of which are critical to healthy physical and social development.“Children who overuse online media are at risk of problematic internet use, and heavy users of video games are at risk of internet gaming disorder” (translation: addiction), the American Academy of Pediatrics wrote in its latest policy statement on media use.Ms. Colier, a licensed clinical social worker, said, “The only difference between digital addiction and other addictions is that this is a socially condoned behavior.” While her book contains a 30-day digital detox program, in our interview she offered three steps to help curb one’s digital dependence.1. Start by recognizing how much digital use is really needed, say, for work or navigation or letting family members know you’re O.K., and what is merely a habit of responding, posting and self-distraction.2. Make little changes. Refrain from using your device while eating or spending time with friends, and add one thing a day that’s done without the phone.3. Become very conscious of what is important to you, what really nourishes you, and devote more time and attention to it."
The Beauty of a Starfish Larva at Lunch,"It was one of those lovely nights when the moonlight on Monterey Bay makes you wonder: What would happen if I put some microbeads in with the starfish larvae?At least that’s what you wonder if you are Manu Prakash, who runs a laboratory at Stanford University and is intrigued by the way life is shaped by the laws of physics.He was actually in a lab that night, with the bay just outside. He and his colleagues had collected the starfish larvae from the bay with other invertebrates that they were studying.The larvae were from a species called the bat star and they propel themselves, like many other small invertebrates, by the beating of many, many hairlike cilia. They are exotic and alluring in shape. “They look like alien starships,” Dr. Prakash said.He put the beads in the seawater with the larvae under a microscope to watch the turbulence they produce around them as they swim. The beads, smaller than red blood cells, follow even small swirls of water and reflect light, so the lines of water flow are visible. What he saw entranced him.The next day he showed it to William Gilpin, a graduate student in his lab, and Vivek N. Prakash, a postdoctoral researcher. They were all “smitten by the beauty of the patterns,” he said.So began a yearlong project to understand what the larvae were doing, and why. The researchers reported the results in the journal Nature Physics in December.The cilia on the surface of a larva, Dr. Prakash said, look “almost like an ornament — a line that goes around the edge of the animal, a high-density band of cilia.”If they all beat together, the larva moves as fast as it can. But if some patches of cilia beat against the prevailing motion they create vortexes, swirling eddies that the researchers found bring algae close to the surface of the larva, and eventually, to its mouth.The larva varies its speed by the number of vortexes it creates. It may make as few as two, in which case it swims along at a good clip and eats little, or as many as six, slowing down to munch the daisies, or algae. The Stanford group’s work involved producing detailed mathematical descriptions of how this all works.A three-minute video produced by the researchers, “Eat, Prey, Swim: Dynamic Vortex Arrays Created by Starfish Larvae,” won a Milton van Dyke Award at the 2016 meeting of the American Physical Society’s Division of Fluid Dynamics, and a 22-second video won first place in the 2016 Nikon Small World in Motion Competition.One other interesting aspect to the story, Dr. Prakash said, is that the vortexes pull in particles of a certain size, so that the tiny animal gets the food it wants. This kind of filtering is very different from the sieves and nets that human technology uses to separate out particles of a certain size.It is used by not just starfish larvae, but countless billions of other microscopic invertebrates that filter food from the oceans.Studying it made Dr. Prakash think that the principles behind this filtering, if well understood, could be adapted to new technologies, filtering particles of a known size without a filter.This is just speculation so far, but it is a potential practical use of knowledge that came out of pure scientific curiosity of the sort that could seem like idle wool gathering to the nonscientist.The research, Dr. Prakash said, started “with a very pure question of shape and beauty and form.”"
Looking at Your Home Planet from Mars,"Greetings Earthlings! This is your planet and its moon as seen from Mars, some 127 million miles away.This composite image, which was released by NASA on Friday, was created using a special camera aboard the agency’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which is a spacecraft orbiting about 180 miles above the red planet. The camera is called the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment. It provides scientists with detailed views of the Martian surface so they can better study geological features like its volcanoes and gullies, as well as scope out potential landing sites for future missions.“It’s the biggest telescope ever sent to another planet,” said Alfred McEwen a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona and the principal investigator of HiRise. Dr. McEwen said that the image was taken while NASA researchers were trying to calibrate the camera. NASA knows precisely what color the moon’s near side is, so when it wants to calibrate HiRise, it points it at the moon and takes some images. NASA then analyzes the pictures and if the colors appear off it can correct the calibration.“The moon is boring. It doesn’t change, it’s relatively bland and it doesn’t have all of these variations or changing clouds. It’s a good calibration target,” Dr. McEwen said. “The Earth is a bad calibration target with all its variability like clouds and such, but it makes a pretty picture.”Earth and the moon appear close in this image, but that is because the moon is actually just behind Earth. The researchers had to wait until the two celestial bodies were positioned like this because it provided them with the best view of the moon to perform their calibration, Dr. McEwen said.To make this picture, scientists combined two separate exposures taken on Nov. 20, 2016, which were processed differently. Dr. McEwen said that NASA needed two exposures to make this image because a good image of the moon saturates Earth, and a good image of Earth makes the moon appear too dark.Vegetation appears red in this image, according to Dr. McEwen. The red spot in the middle of Earth is Australia, the one on the top left is Southeast Asia and Antarctica is the bright white blob in the bottom left."
Heartburn Drugs in Pregnancy Tied to Asthma in Babies,"Taking heartburn medicines during pregnancy may increase the risk for asthma in the baby, a review of studies has found.The analysis, in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, combined data from eight studies that included more than 1.6 million patients. Follow-up ranged from five to 14 years.Researchers found that H2 blockers, such as Pepcid or Tagamet, were associated with a 46 percent increased risk for childhood asthma. Taking proton pump inhibitors, such as Prilosec or Nexium, was linked to a 30 percent increase in risk. There was also some data suggesting an increased risk for skin allergies.The reason for the connection is unclear, but animal studies suggest the drugs may interfere with digestion, leaving undigested food allergens that are then passed on to the fetus.None of the studies accounted for all of the many factors that may influence asthma onset, and the authors acknowledge that no causal connection can be proven.“Gastric reflux is common in pregnancy,” said the lead author, Dr. Aziz Sheikh, a professor of primary care at the University of Edinburgh, “and in the majority of women, it can be managed with lifestyle or diet changes.”Where medicine is required, he said, “Milder treatments like chewable antacid tablets are the preferred option.”"
‘Weekend Warriors’ Show Survival Benefits,"Working out only on the weekends or otherwise compressing your total physical activity into one or two prolonged runs or a single vigorous basketball or soccer game each week could lessen your risks of dying prematurely almost as effectively as more frequent, shorter workouts spread throughout the week, according to an interesting new study of the so-called weekend warrior phenomenon.As most of us have heard by now, the standard recommendation about how much exercise we should complete each week for health purposes is 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity. Moderate exercise consists of activities like brisk walking or easy cycling that raise heart rates while still allowing us to talk to training partners, and vigorous activities are those like running, fast-paced cycling, and many team sports, including basketball and soccer, that raise heart rates into a zone where speaking is difficult.Meeting these guidelines is associated with a substantially reduced risk of developing a wide range of diseases and dying too young.The guidelines also suggest that, for practical purposes, people consider breaking the 150 minutes into five moderate 30-minute sessions each week or a comparable number of shorter, more vigorous workouts.But many people apparently do not have the time or inclination to exercise five times per week. About a third of American adults engage in zero weekly exercise and others pack their workouts into one or two sessions on Saturday or Sunday, when they have more free time.There has been little information, though, about whether the weekend warrior pattern of exercise lowers the risk for premature death as effectively as more frequent and generally shorter workouts.So for the new study, which was published on Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers at Loughborough University in England and other institutions decided to delve into the exercise routines of tens of thousands of men and women already participating in the Health Survey for England and the Scottish Health Survey.The researchers zeroed in on data from 63,591 middle-aged men and women who had provided detailed descriptions of their workout patterns when they first entered the study at least 15 years before, telling the survey questioners how many minutes they had exercised each week during the past month, what kinds of exercise they had undertaken, and how many times per week they had worked out.The researchers used that data to categorize the men and women into a variety of groups. Those who never exercised were defined, unsurprisingly, as inactive, while those who worked out but did not meet the standard guidelines were considered insufficiently active. Those who did exercise for the full 150 gentle or 75 vigorous weekly minutes were labeled sufficiently active.This last group was then subdivided into those who spread their physical activity over at least three sessions and those who jammed it into one or two workouts, presumably on weekends (although the actual days were not specified).Interestingly, these weekend warriors were mostly male, almost half exercised only once per week, and an overwhelming majority, almost 90 percent, reported that their exercise occurred during vigorous sports like competitive running and cycling or team sports like soccer.Finally, the researchers crosschecked their participants against death registries, to determine mortality in the intervening years since each person had joined the original survey.It turned out that exercise, in any amount, had substantially lessened the risk that someone would die from any cause, including heart disease and cancer. Men and women who exercised, even if they did not meet the guideline recommendations, were about 29 percent less likely to die prematurely than people who never worked out.Those who met the recommendations gained a slight edge in longevity, being about 30 percent less likely to have died than people who never exercised.This advantage remained about the same whether people worked out three or more times during the week or jammed all of their activity into a session or two.“Reductions in risk were similar in the weekend warriors and the regularly active,” says Gary O’Donovan, a research associate at Loughborough University who led the study.Of course, this study was observational so it can’t tell us whether exercise actually caused people to live longer but only that the two are associated.It also raises questions it cannot answer, including whether weekend warriors might be missing out on other potential health gains from exercise.Frequent exercise is generally thought to be better than fewer workouts at, for instance, preventing and controlling Type 2 diabetes, says Hannah Arem, an epidemiologist at George Washington University who wrote a commentary to accompany the new study.Weekend warriors also could be losing aerobic fitness between workouts, since endurance capacity typically declines after a four- or five-day layoff. So weekend warriors might be rebuilding and maintaining but not augmenting their baseline fitness from one week to the next.And they are likely to face a higher risk of sports-related injuries than people who exercise more often.But even with those caveats, the good news from this study, Dr. O’Donovan says, is that whatever type of activity you can fit into your schedule appears to be better for your longevity than no activity at all."
Finding a Home on the Tree of Life for a Tentacled Ice Cream Cone With a Lid,"Behold the hyolith — a bizarre Cambrian-period creature that dwelt on the ocean floor alongside other armored invertebrates like trilobites more than 500 million years ago. Its body was encased in a pair of shells that resembled an ice cream cone with a lid like a trap door. Two tusklike spines protruded from the soft tissue near the hinge, and on top of its mouth was a row of fluttering tentacles.Since its discovery in the 19th century, the hyolith has puzzled paleontologists. Some thought it was a mollusk, like a snail or clam. Others said it belonged to its own group of animals.Joseph Moysiuk, an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, thinks he has solved the mystery. After analyzing more than 1,500 hyolith fossils, Mr. Moysiuk has concluded that the hyolith belonged to a known group of organisms called lophophorates, which would make them most closely related to present-day brachiopods.Brachiopods are shell-bearing marine animals that resemble bivalve mollusks like clams, but have different shell structures.“This is the first time that this group of animals can be solidly placed in the evolutionary tree of life,” Mr. Moysiuk said. He and his colleagues published their finding on Wednesday in the journal Nature.The key to deciphering the hyolith mystery was the creature’s soft tissue. Typically when paleontologists find fossils they uncover the hard parts of an organism, like its teeth, bones or shells. Soft tissue is much harder to find because it does not fossilize easily. But some of the samples that Mr. Moysiuk came across had preserved soft tissue. Many of these specimens came from deposits near the Burgess Shale in British Columbia, which is a well-known fossil hunting site that contains prehistoric remains that date back more than 500 million years.Using a scanning electron microscope and other tools that tested for traces of specific elements like sulfur, Mr. Moysiuk found several samples had tentacles near their mouths. After comparing the hyolith specimens, which are only a few centimeters long, with known mollusks and brachiopods, Mr. Moysiuk discovered that the tentacles were actually feeding structures called lophophores, the signature structures of the Lophophorata group, which includes brachiopods.“When we first observed this in some of the fossils, that was really a ‘wow’ moment,” said Mr. Moysiuk. “It’s nice to be able to conclude this mystery that has been around for 175 years.”In addition to discerning the hyoliths’ place in the tree of life, Mr. Moysiuk and his colleagues also discussed a purpose for the tusklike structures, known as helens. Mr. Moysiuk and his colleagues suggest the structures were used to prop the creature up from the sea floor to help it filter-feed.“It’s a pretty surprising discovery,” said Uwe Balthasar, a paleontologist from Plymouth University in Britain, who was not involved in the study but reviewed the paper. “This group, which has confidently been placed in the group of mollusks, now has to be interpreted as being closer to brachiopods.”Mark Sutton, a paleontologist from Imperial College London who also reviewed the paper, said the finding solved a longstanding mystery about the hyolith’s place in the tree of life.“Finding them with enough soft tissue to actually place them is a major coup,” Dr. Sutton said. “This is the sort of thing that will rewrite textbooks — at least the ones that talk about hyoliths.”"
The Downside of Breast Cancer Screening,"A 17-year study has concluded that screening mammography — in which all women in certain age groups are routinely screened for breast cancer — does not reduce the incidence of advanced tumors, but does increase the diagnosis of lesions that would never have led to health problems.In Denmark, screening was implemented in different regions at different times, so researchers there were able to compare groups of women who were screened with those who were not.If screening were effective, a reduction in the incidence of advanced tumors would be expected — tumors would be caught and treated when small. Instead, the researchers found no difference in incidence between screened and unscreened groups. But in screened groups, they found substantial overdiagnosis — that is, detection of tumors that would not become cancers needing treatment.The study, in Annals of Internal Medicine, found that, depending on age and other factors, between a fifth and a third of tumors detected by screening were overdiagnosed. The researchers concluded that screening does not prevent advanced cancers or lower breast cancer mortality.“Some types of screening are a good idea — colorectal, for example,” said the lead author, Dr. Karsten Juhl Jorgensen, deputy director of the Nordic Cochrane Center. “But breast cancer has a biology that doesn’t lend itself to screening. Healthy women get a breast cancer diagnosis, and this has serious psychological consequences and well-known physical harms from unnecessary treatment. We’re really doing more harm than good.”"
Red Meat Tied to Diverticulitis Risk,"Diverticulitis, inflamed pouches in the lining of the digestive tract, can lead to severe pain and may even require surgery. Now a new study suggests that one cause of diverticulitis may be eating red meat.Researchers used data on 46,461 male health professionals in a continuing study that began in 1986. Periodically since then, the men have reported data on lifestyle factors, medical history and diet, including their consumption of red meat, chicken and fish, and how much was processed red meat like salami or hot dogs.By 2012, they found 764 cases of diverticulitis. The study is in Gut.After controlling for other health and lifestyle factors associated with the disorder, they found that compared with those in the lowest one-fifth for total red meat consumption, those in the highest one-fifth had a 58 percent increased risk for diverticulitis. Most of the increase was due to unprocessed red meat — for every additional daily serving of it, the risk for diverticulitis increased by 18 percent.“There is an idea that there is some pro-inflammatory state mediated by red meat that could contribute to inflammation in certain organs,” said the lead author, Andrew T. Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard. “Diverticulitis is a clear example of inflammation with serious consequences.”"
Sometimes Nature is Morbid. That’s Why There’s #BestCarcass.,"Warning: The photos with some of the tweets that this article links to depict graphic scenes from nature. If you ever had a photo of an animal carcass stashed away on your computer or phone because you were too mesmerized to trash it, and you were too terrified about what others would think to share it, you are not alone. Since Tuesday biologists and the morbidly curious alike have been blowing up Twitter with a photo contest for #BestCarcass.The photos depict a kind of heavy metal version of your typical nature documentary. Swollen, shriveled, gnarled, bloody, stringy, flattened, crusty, sometimes frozen in place: the pictures aren’t conventionally pretty. But beyond the gore, each photo contains a story — not just about the lives of the animals involved, but about those making and sharing the photos. So even if you’re not sitting on a stash of decaying animal photos, for those of you with an inquisitive mind and a strong stomach, now is your moment.The macabre Twitter battle emerged on Jan. 10 after a group of scientists, who have all studied African carnivores and know one another through Twitter, started sharing photos of prey from the field. Julien Fattebert, an ecologist at the Swiss Ornithological Institute (Vogelwarte), started the hashtag.Other biologists followed. And once Anne Hilborn, a Ph.D. student at Virginia Tech, who has a loyal Twitter following, chimed in, photos from all over the world started rolling in.“Everyone started sharing pictures of dead animals, more or less decomposed,” Dr. Fattebert wrote in an email. “There’s obviously an aesthetically macabre side to it — I think some of these images are pure gold!”The hashtag’s initial momentum surprised him, but he was glad it happened. “Death is inherent to life, and we have to deal with it more often than not. And it’s sometimes disgusting, yes,” he wrote. “I think this hashtag has opened a window on this side of life science.” Or as he put it on Twitter:There will never be a real #BestCarcass winner, said the scientists, but some qualities make a photo stand out. For Ms. Hilborn, the ideal #BestCarcass reveals an interesting backstory, an artistic angle or a morbid sense of humor.For others, it’s the gore.“There’s an ideal Goldilocks middle ground of decomposition where you want it to look bad enough that people say, ‘Oh gross,’ but not so gone that it’s just bones and skin,” said Arjun Dheer, a conservation biologist who studies hyenas and posted a photo from his research when the hashtag emerged.Finally, others are drawn to the remnants of an animal’s final behavior seen in the carcass.The stories behind some of the photos illustrate these points.Emanuele Biggi, a naturalist and conservation photographer, shot this image of a mass mortality of thousands of frogs in a pond in Aveto Regional Park in northern Italy. “Sometimes climate change is striking in a odd way, surprising the frogs with extreme cold and ice while they’re already breeding into water,” he wrote in an email.And then there was the miscarried fetus of a zebra, which was just one of many images shared by Ms. Hilborn, who studies the hunting behavior of cheetahs in Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, which she said is covered in carcasses. She drove past what appeared to her to be a miscarried zebra. She stopped and took photos because she was impressed by the level of detail she could see. And she says this photo shows that sometimes diseases cause miscarriages on the Serengeti, although it’s not totally clear that’s what happened here.Not everyone was comfortable with this level of gore. Ms. Hilborn acknowledges that especially gory photos may benefit from warnings, but she doesn’t think people should stop posting. Everyone, she said, must draw her own line.“As a biologist, I think my line is a lot further than others because I deal with a lot of death in my research,” she said. “But I try to make sure there’s some kind of educational part of it. I’m not just posting to shock people.”When Ted Stankowich, an ecologist and evolutionary biologist at California State University, Long Beach, saw the hashtag moving on Twitter, he took it as an opportunity to share some of the gruesome images from his field work. He posted an image of the leftover anal gland of a skunk, which was untouched by predators and scavengers at a park in California.Dr. Stankowich is trying to understand how some animals, like coyotes, have adapted to avoid skunks, while other animals, like some domestic dogs, haven’t. This leftover anal gland, the part that holds the skunk’s signature smell, is an indication that the animal that ate it knew of the stench lurking inside.And in Germany, a newspaper called Schwäbische Zeitung shared its image from a story about a fox ice cube that a hunter had found in Fridingen. The fox had drowned after falling through the ice while trying to cross the Danube River in December, Yannick Dillinger, an editor at the paper, wrote in an email.Ms. Hilborn sees the educational value of #BestCarcass and hopes the contest never ends and continues to reveal a taboo side of the life cycle. And although the hashtag’s momentum is already slowing down, biology Twitter users, with their unusual senses of humor, are bound to produce another unpredictable social media trend soon."
Australian Drug Maker Has Low Profile but Powerful Backers in Washington,"SAN FRANCISCO — Innate Immunotherapeutics is a tiny pharmaceutical company from Australia that has no approved drugs and no backing from flashy venture capital firms, and trades for just over a dollar a share on the Australian Stock Exchange. More than once, the company has run out of money and nearly closed its doors.But despite its unremarkable profile, Innate has some surprisingly influential boosters in Washington. The congressional liaison to President-elect Donald J. Trump’s transition team, Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York, is the company’s largest shareholder and sits on the board. Representative Tom Price of Georgia, Mr. Trump’s nominee to be secretary of health and human services, purchased shares of Innate four times in 2015 and 2016, according to congressional financial disclosures, totaling between $60,000 and $110,000.Other Washington power players with investments in the company include Michael Hook, Mr. Collins’s chief of staff, who is a top shareholder, and Bill Paxon, a Washington lobbyist and former congressman, according to company filings and congressional financial disclosures. Last summer, Mr. Price, Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon bought the stock at a discount as part of a private offering organized by Innate aimed at “sophisticated U.S. investors.” They have since quintupled their money, at least on paper.Mr. Price’s investments in health care companies, including Innate, are almost certain to be a focus of questioning during his confirmation hearings next week. Some prominent Democrats are already asking whether he may have crossed ethical lines by investing in companies that stood to benefit from legislation he helped shape. Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Louise Slaughter of New York and other Democrats have called for investigations into Mr. Price’s trades.On Wednesday, Mr. Price, who as health secretary would oversee the Food and Drug Administration, filed papers with the federal government saying he would divest himself of interests in several health care companies, including Innate. Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the presidential transition, said that Mr. Price took “his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously,” and that the Office of Government Ethics had completed an “exhaustive” review of his financial holdings.Representatives of Mr. Price and Mr. Collins say they have not broken any rules, but what has puzzled Washington and industry insiders alike is how a no-name Australian biotech, with only one experimental multiple sclerosis drug under development, attracted a coterie of Washington investors, including the man who is likely to become the next health secretary.“Maybe Chris is just a cheerleader for the company and Tom Price jumped in head over heels,” said Craig Holman, the government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen, a consumer group, which has asked for an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. “But it’s got to be taken a look at. It’s just so suspicious, someone’s got to ask, ‘What just happened?’”Mr. Collins and Mr. Price have both been active in shaping health care legislation, and both voted in favor of the 21st Century Cures Act, which was backed by the pharmaceutical industry and included measures that would allow the F.D.A. to approve drugs more quickly. Mr. Price is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee’s subcommittee on health, and Mr. Collins serves on the health panel of the Energy and Commerce Committee.A spokesman for Mr. Collins said the congressman had followed all ethical guidelines and said Innate was one of many companies he had been involved in. “He is very proud of the progress the company has made over the years and hopeful it will be able to develop a potentially lifesaving treatment for the millions of individuals suffering from secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,” said the spokesman, Michael McAdams.In an interview this week in San Francisco, Innate’s chief executive, Simon Wilkinson, seemed amused at all of the attention now being paid to what he described as his “little biotech at the wrong end of the world.”Mr. Wilkinson and Michael Quinn, Innate’s chairman, said they had never heard of many of the company’s more prominent investors, and said they first learned that Mr. Price had invested in the company from an article in The Wall Street Journal, which first reported his investment. They also said they had not heard of Mr. Hook, the 19th-largest shareholder, or Mr. Paxon and said they had little interest in gaining the ear of powerful Washington players.Their goal, they said, is to sell the company to a larger pharmaceutical company.“It won’t be up to us to seek approval for the drug,” Mr. Wilkinson said in the interview, which took place at his hotel on a rundown block in San Francisco, where he was pitching the company to potential buyers at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference.Like many biotech start-ups, Innate has had ups and downs, Mr. Wilkinson said. “But sometimes, things happen,” he added. In his case, he said, “I met Chris.”Mr. Wilkinson said he was on a fund-raising trip to the United States in 2005 when the two met, and he made his pitch to Mr. Collins, who was then a businessman with a reputation for turning around struggling companies. Mr. Collins decided to invest in the company, eventually joining its board.In 2007, Mr. Collins was elected county executive of Erie County, which includes Buffalo, and in 2012, he won election to Congress. He remained on Innate’s board, and Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Quinn said his new political career has had little impact.“If anything, I suspect it’s probably a negative,” Mr. Quinn said. “Because he’s a bit harder to access — he’s just busy.”Mr. Collins remained one of the company’s top cheerleaders, enlisting many of his associates as investors and even lending the company money a handful of times when it was at risk of going out of business.Today, many of Innate’s biggest shareholders have ties to Mr. Collins. They include two of his adult children, Caitlin and Cameron, who are the company’s third- and fourth-biggest shareholders, as well as several Buffalo businessmen who have donated to his political campaigns, according to company filings and campaign finance disclosures. Lindy Ruff, the head coach of the Dallas Stars hockey team and a former player and coach for the Buffalo Sabres, is also an investor.Innate’s sole drug in development, MIS416, is in clinical trials in Australia and New Zealand to evaluate whether it works in people with an advanced form of multiple sclerosis. A midlevel trial is underway, and results are due in the middle of this year.Experts in congressional ethics and trading rules said there did not appear to be evidence that Mr. Collins or Mr. Price used nonpublic information to steer their investment activities, a practice that would violate what is known as the Stock Act, which bans insider trading by members of Congress. But, said Donna M. Nagy, a law professor at Indiana University who has written on the financial investments by members of Congress, “One needs facts in order to get answers to those questions, and coming up with the facts for that is going to be difficult.”Mr. Holman of Public Citizen said Mr. Collins’s recruiting efforts among Washington power players created the opportunity for “influence peddling.” For example, Mr. Paxon, who represented Mr. Collins’s congressional district in the 1990s, could appear before Mr. Collins as both a lobbyist and a fellow investor in Innate.“It’s a very effective means of buying access and hopefully influencing politicians,” Mr. Holman said.Mr. Collins’s spokesman said Mr. Paxon and Mr. Collins had never discussed Innate and noted that, because they are both from the Buffalo area, he might have become aware of Innate through other investors in the region. Mr. Paxon did not respond to emails and a call for comment.Last summer, Innate offered a select opportunity to United States investors, one that Mr. Collins’s friends and associates appear to have benefited from. Under what is known as a private placement, Innate sold a limited number of shares at a discount in an effort to raise capital. In company filings, Innate said one offering of the shares would be sold to “sophisticated U.S. investors” and would be used, among other things, to finance a clinical trial and to gain permission from the F.D.A. to start a process that could lead to applying for approval of the drug in the United States.Last summer, Mr. Price, Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon were among 16 entities that took part in the private American placement, as did several other of Mr. Collins’s associates and donors, according to the company filing. Mr. Price and Mr. Hook also participated in a second offering in the summer, the filings show. Mr. Price purchased between $50,000 and $100,000 in Innate shares in August, which was among the largest stock buys he had made since 2012, according to congressional financial disclosures. The investment was larger than his trades in more established pharmaceutical stocks like Pfizer and Merck.With his discount from the private placements, Mr. Price would have purchased some stock at 25 Australian cents per share in August and some at 34 cents. The stock closed on Friday at $1.31.Mr. McAdams, Mr. Collins’s spokesman, said the private placement was available to qualified American investors and said Mr. Hook had previously invested in a private placement with the company in 2009, before Mr. Collins was a congressman. Several other investors were longtime friends of Mr. Collins, Mr. McAdams said, and their investment predates his time in Congress.Mr. Quinn dismissed questions about whether anyone engaged in insider trading and said the company’s stock had been rising in anticipation of the results of the clinical trial later this year. The outcome of such trials is typically kept secret from investors and even company executives.“Right now the whole value of this thing swings on a bet on the study results,” he said.In San Francisco this week, Mr. Wilkinson said he had received interest in a possible acquisition from about 20 “high grade” pharmaceutical companies. The drug, if approved, would be the first to treat a progressive form of multiple sclerosis.But he was also self-deprecating, noting wryly that Innate was such a “bottom feeder” at the JPMorgan conference that the company had not even qualified for an invitation to attend the main event."
In the Shopping Cart of a Food Stamp Household: Lots of Soda,"What do households on food stamps buy at the grocery store?The answer was largely a mystery until now. The United States Department of Agriculture, which oversees the $74 billion food stamp program called SNAP, has published a detailed report that provides a glimpse into the shopping cart of the typical household that receives food stamps.The findings show that the No. 1 purchases by SNAP households are soft drinks, which accounted for 5 percent of the dollars they spent on food. The category of ‘sweetened beverages,’ which includes soft drinks, fruit juices, energy drinks and sweetened teas, accounted for almost 10 percent of the dollars they spent on food. “In this sense, SNAP is a multibillion-dollar taxpayer subsidy of the soda industry,” said Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. “It’s pretty shocking.”For years, dozens of cities, states and medical groups have urged changes to SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to help improve nutrition among the 43 million poorest Americans who receive food stamps. Specifically, they have called for restrictions so that food stamps cannot be used to buy junk food or sugary soft drinks.But the food and beverage industries have spent millions opposing such measures, and the U.S.D.A. has denied every request, saying that selectively banning certain foods would be unfair to food stamp users and create too much red tape.While the report, published recently, suggests that a disproportionate amount of food stamp money is going toward unhealthful foods, the U.S.D.A. said it was unfair to single out food stamp recipients for their soft drink consumption.The report compared SNAP households and non-SNAP households. While those who used food stamps bought slightly more junk food and fewer vegetables, both SNAP and non-SNAP households bought ample amounts of sweetened drinks, candy, ice cream and potato chips. Among non-SNAP households, for example, soft drinks ranked second on the list of food purchases, behind milk.“Sweetened beverages are a common purchase in all households across America,” Kevin Concannon, the U.S.D.A. under secretary for food, nutrition and consumer services, said in an interview. “This report raises a question for all households: Are we consuming too many sweetened beverages, period?”The report was based on data from an unnamed, nationwide grocery chain, which provided the U.S.D.A. with monthly records of food items bought in 2011 by more than 26 million households, about three million of them food stamp recipients. The grocery chain identified and tracked SNAP households by their use of SNAP benefit cards at the checkout aisle. One limitation of the report was that it could not always distinguish when SNAP households used their benefits, other money or a combination of the two to pay for transactions.Nonetheless, the report provides a striking look at the foods American households typically buy.Across all households, the report found, “more money was spent on soft drinks than any other item” — a finding that reflects the fact that, while consumption of sugary drinks is lower today than it was a decade ago, the United States still consumes more sugary drinks than almost any other developed country, studies show.The U.S.D.A. report found that milk, cheese, potato chips, beef, cold cereal and baked bread were among the top purchases for all households. It indicated that all Americans bought ample amounts of desserts, salty snacks, candy and other junk foods. But the SNAP households spent slightly less money on nutritious foods, including fruits and vegetables, beans, eggs, nuts and seeds.Over all, the report found, SNAP households spent about 40 cents of every dollar at the grocery store on “basic items” like meat, fruits, vegetables, milk, eggs and bread. Another 40 cents of every dollar was spent on “cereal, prepared foods, dairy products, rice and beans.” Lastly, 20 cents of each dollar was spent on a broad category of junk foods that included “sweetened beverages, desserts, salty snacks, candy and sugar.”SNAP households spent 9.3 percent of their grocery budgets on sweetened beverages. That was slightly higher than the 7.1 percent figure for households that do not receive food stamps.The U.S.D.A. concluded that both food stamp recipients and other households generally made similar purchases.But several public health experts said the findings were deeply troubling.David Ludwig, the director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children’s Hospital, said the purpose of SNAP was to protect the health and well-being of the nation, not to ensure that poor households had ample access to sugary drinks.“We have more evidence for the harms of sugary beverages than for any other category of food,” he said, “and yet it tops the list of reimbursed products in SNAP.”Dr. Ludwig said other government programs had common-sense restrictions. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, better known as WIC, and the national school lunch program have strict nutrition standards. Medicare pays for necessary medical procedures but does not reimburse for ones it considers harmful, ineffective or unnecessary. SNAP, Dr. Ludwig said, should be structured similarly.“No one is suggesting poor people can’t choose what they want to eat,” he said. “But we’re saying let’s not use government benefits to pay for foods that are demonstrably going to undermine public health.”The federal government provides SNAP benefits to roughly 23 million households each month, many of them single-parent homes at or below the poverty line. The average household receives about $256 in monthly benefits. That means a household that spent 10 percent of its SNAP money on sweetened beverages could buy at least 20 two-liter bottles of orange Crush soda at a Fine Fare supermarket in New York City, or about 50 cans of Sprite at a Walmart near Oakland, Calif.Since 2004, a number of cities and states have sought to restrict sugary drinks from their SNAP programs, including Maine, Minnesota and New York City under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2011. But doing so requires permission from the U.S.D.A., and the agency has denied every official request.Mr. Concannon at the U.S.D.A. said the agency had “intermittent dialogue” with municipalities across the country about prohibiting the purchase of sugary drinks through SNAP. But he said the agency would grant a state or city permission to do so only on the condition that it first conducted “a rigorous pilot study” and offered food stamp recipients the ability to opt out of the soda restrictions.“We’d want rigorous evaluation to see what is the impact of such a policy,” he said.PepsiCo lobbied the federal government to prevent restrictions on food stamp purchases in 2011, 2012 and 2013, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit that tracks money in politics. Coca-Cola, Kraft Foods and the sugar industry lobbied against a Florida bill in 2012 that would have banned using food stamps to buy soda and junk food. And in 2011, the Snack Food Association teamed up with beverage industry lobbyists and the National Confectioners Association, which represents candy companies, to defeat New York City’s proposed ban on using food stamps to buy sugar-sweetened beverages.Mr. Concannon said the U.S.D.A., rather than restricting junk foods, had made incentive programs that encourage nutritious foods a priority. The federal farm bill that designates money for the SNAP program, for example, set aside $100 million for programs that increase the value of food stamps that are used to buy fruits and vegetables at retail stores or farmers’ markets.“Our goal has been to nudge people in the right direction,” he said.While there is evidence that people do buy more fruits and vegetables when given incentives, research suggests that banning sugary drinks would have a far more powerful impact on health.In 2014, a group of Stanford researchers studied 19,000 SNAP participants and compared whether banning sugary drinks or incentivizing fruits and vegetables would affect obesity rates. The researchers found that the incentive program would not. But banning sugary drinks from SNAP, they said, “would be expected to significantly reduce obesity prevalence and Type 2 diabetes incidence, particularly among ages 18 to 65 and some racial and ethnic minorities.”Michele Simon, a public health lawyer who published a critical 2012 report on the food stamp program, said the new report showed that the federal government was subsidizing many foods that its own dietary guidelines explicitly told Americans to consume less of.“This is the first time we’ve had confirmation that this massive taxpayer program is promoting all the wrong kinds of foods,” she said. “I think we now have the data to back up the policy argument that this program needs to be improved.”"
"Getting Older, Sleeping Less","Insomnia is like a thief in the night, robbing millions — especially those older than 60 — of much-needed restorative sleep. As the king laments in Shakespeare’s “Henry IV, Part 2”: O sleep, O gentle sleep, Nature’s soft nurse, how have I frightened thee. That thou no more will weigh my eyelids down, And steep my senses in forgetfulness?The causes of insomnia are many, and they increase in number and severity as people age. Yet the problem is often overlooked during routine checkups, which not only diminishes the quality of an older person’s life but may also cause or aggravate physical and emotional disorders, including symptoms of cognitive loss.Most everyone experiences episodic insomnia, a night during which the body seems to have forgotten how to sleep a requisite number of hours, if at all. As distressing as that may seem at the time, it pales in comparison to the effects on people for whom insomnia — difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep or awakening much too early — is a nightly affair.A survey done in 1995 by researchers at the National Institute on Aging among more than 9,000 people aged 65 and older living in three communities revealed that 42 percent reported difficulty with both falling asleep and staying asleep. The numbers affected are likely to be much larger now that millions spend their pre-sleep hours looking at electronic screens that can disrupt the body’s biological rhythms.Insomnia, Dr. Alon Y. Avidan says, “is a symptom, not a diagnosis” that can be a clue to an underlying and often treatable health problem and, when it persists, should be taken seriously. Dr. Avidan is director of the sleep clinic at the University of California, Los Angeles, David Geffen School of Medicine.So-called transient insomnia that lasts less than a month may result from a temporary problem at work or an acute illness; short-term insomnia lasting one to six months may stem from a personal financial crisis or loss of a loved one. Several months of insomnia are distressing enough, but when insomnia becomes chronic, lasting six months or longer, it can wreak serious physical, emotional and social havoc.In addition to excessive daytime sleepiness, which can be dangerous in and of itself, Dr. Avidan reports that chronic insomnia “may result in disturbed intellect, impaired cognition, confusion, psychomotor retardation, or increased risk for injury.” Understandably, it is often accompanied by depression either as a cause or result of persistent insomnia. Untreated insomnia also increases the risk of falls and fractures, a study of nursing home residents showed.There are two types of insomnia. One, called primary insomnia, results from a problem that occurs only or mainly during sleep, like obstructive sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome (which afflicts 15 to 20 percent of older adults), periodic limb movements or a tendency to act out one’s dreams physically, which can be an early warning sign of Parkinson’s disease.Unless noted by their bed partners, people with primary sleep disorders may not know why their sleep is disrupted. An accurate diagnosis often requires a professional sleep study: spending a night or two in a sleep lab hooked up to instruments that record respiration, heart rate, blood pressure, bodily movements and time spent in the various stages of sleep.The other, more common type of insomnia is secondary to an underlying medical or psychiatric problem; the side effects of medications; behavioral factors like ill-timed exposure to caffeine, alcohol or nicotine or daytime naps; or environmental disturbances like jet lag or excessive noise or light — especially the blue light from an electronic device — in the bedroom.Among the many medical conditions that can cause insomnia are heart failure, gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), lung disease, arthritis, Alzheimer’s disease and incontinence. Treating the underlying condition, if possible, often relieves the insomnia.Regardless of the reason for insomnia, it can become a learned response when people anticipate having difficulty falling asleep or returning to sleep after middle-of-the-night awakenings. They may spend hours lying awake in bed worrying about being unable to sleep, and the anxiety itself impairs their ability to sleep.The more one frets about a sleep problem, the worse it can get. When on occasion I awaken in the wee hours of the morning and can’t get back to sleep, I usually get up and do something useful, which takes the curse off my insomnia. If I’m worried about forgetting something important, I write it on a pad kept next to the bed, taking care not to turn on a light. (Bright light in the middle of the night can reset your biological clock; if you get up to use the bathroom, use a night light near the floor.)Nonmedical causes of insomnia are often successfully treated by practicing “good sleep hygiene,” a concept developed by the late Peter J. Hauri, a sleep specialist at the Mayo Clinic. That means limiting naps to less than 30 minutes a day, preferably early in the afternoon; avoiding stimulants and sedatives; avoiding heavy meals and minimizing liquids within two to three hours of bedtime; getting moderate exercise daily, preferably in the morning or early afternoon; maximizing exposure to bright light during the day and minimizing it at night; creating comfortable sleep conditions; and going to bed only when you feel sleepy.If you still can’t fall asleep within about 20 minutes in bed, experts recommend leaving the bedroom and doing something relaxing, like reading a book (one printed on paper, not on a brightly lit screen), and returning to bed when you feel sleepy.Many people mistakenly resort to alcohol as a sleep aid. While it may help people fall asleep initially, it produces fragmented sleep and interferes with REM sleep, Dr. Avidan and others report.For those who still need help with insomnia, cognitive behavioral therapy has proved most effective in clinical trials, though finding a specialist may be challenging in some parts of the country.Sleeping pills can be problematic, especially for older people who are more sensitive to their side effects, including daytime hangover. Even short-acting drugs like zaleplon (Sonata), zolpidem (Ambien) or ramelteon (Rozerem) can have side effects.Alternatives include over-the-counter remedies like melatonin or valerian, which have more anecdotal evidence than research to attest to their efficacy. The brain makes melatonin, the body’s natural sleepiness hormone, in response to darkness.There may also be some useful dietary aids, like bananas, cherries, kiwis, oatmeal, milk and chamomile tea, though evidence for these is also primarily anecdotal. One friend told me she solved a longstanding sleep problem by eating a banana two hours before bedtime."
Born to Be an Ear Wiggler?,"Q. Why can some people wiggle their ears, but not others?A. People cannot swivel their ears to point at a sound source, while many animals, like cats and dogs, can do so with ease. Humans do have weak vestigial muscles attached to the shell of the ear, called the auricle or pinna, as well as evidence of a vestigial nervous system, which could have functioned to orient the ears.Some people can control their auricular muscles to move the ear slightly but to a noticeable extent, an ability that seems to have a genetic basis.A 2015 study in the journal Psychophysiology reviewed past research on the auricular nerves and found indications that the system could have been adapted to respond to sounds. For example, shifting the eyes from side to side produces weak electrical activity in ear muscles and a minuscule curling of the outer edge of the ear, and a sudden noise behind one ear elicits weak electrical activity in the muscles behind that ear.As for the familial nature of wiggling, the inheritance pattern is unclear and does not appear to have a simple dominant-gene mechanism.A study published in 1949 in the journal Hereditas involved only 104 men and 70 women. It found that most but not all the wigglers, 74 percent of them, had at least one parent who was a wiggler, and 47 percent of the wigglers had a sibling who was a wiggler.Some people can reportedly improve their ear wiggling by concentration and practice, but they have to have the ability to begin with. question@nytimes.com"
Absolutely Every Bit of Our Galaxy,"Astronomers have arrived at what they believe to be the most accurate measure yet of the mass of the Milky Way: about 4.8 x 1011 times the mass of the sun, or “solar masses,” to use a standard unit of mass in astronomy.This comes to about 9.5 x 1041 kilograms — that is, 95 followed by 40 zeros. The number, of course, is inexact, as obviously no direct measure of all the billions of stars and other objects in the Milky Way could be taken.But in a paper to be published in The Astrophysical Journal, scientists used methods of measurement that involve complex mathematical and statistical techniques called hierarchical Bayesian analysis, as well as direct measurements of the velocity of globular clusters, the tightly packed spherical groups of 10,000 to 100,000 old stars that move through the galaxy.Just as the mass of the sun can be calculated by measuring its gravitational pull on Earth, the mass of the Milky Way can be calculated by measuring its gravitational pull on the globular clusters.The estimate includes everything within 125 kiloparsecs of the center of the galaxy — that is, within 3.9 x 1018 kilometers. And “everything” is not just stars: There are planets, moons, gases, dust and other objects, not to mention the immense amount of dark matter. It cannot be detected directly, but its mass can be inferred from its gravitational effect on other objects.“The biggest thing is that we’re including measurement uncertainties that are carried through the analysis,” said the lead author, Gwendolyn M. Eadie, a doctoral candidate at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. “So we have a good handle on the uncertainty in our mass estimate. The low end is 4.0 x 1011 solar masses, and the high end is 5.8 x 1011.”Ms. Eadie said that the findings were important from an astronomer’s perspective. “The methods we’ve developed could be important in other studies that do other kinds of research,” she said. “These methods have been used in other fields, but they’re starting to become more useful in astronomy now that we have computers that can do these complex calculations.”What does it mean for the rest of us? “It just satisfies curiosity about the world we live in,” she said."
Eight Crossings and 192 Atoms Long: the Tightest Knot Ever Tied,"British scientists have tied the tightest knot ever tied and, as unlikely as it may seem, this is important.Knots are useful in everyday life and specific kinds of knots are suitable for specific tasks — bowlines, cleats, hitches and nooses all hold things together in different ways. The same is true on the molecular level, where braided or knotted strings of atoms and molecules can be put together in different patterns with varying characteristics.Until now, scientists have been able to create only simple molecular knots with three or five crossings of strands. Now researchers, in a study published in Science, have described a way to tie a much more complicated, and therefore much stronger, knot.Everyone knows, for example, that Kevlar is very strong — impenetrable even to a bullet. But why? Its molecules connect to form long chains that run parallel to each other. Together these molecules form an extremely strong yet flexible material.But the structure of Kevlar is relatively simple: identical molecules packed tightly next to each other like pencils in a pencil box. Knotted or woven strands of molecules, on the other hand, can potentially create an even more flexible, lighter and stronger material — a tightly knit sweater on the molecular level.To create their stronger knot, a team of researchers mixed oxygen, nitrogen and carbon in a solution with metal ions. The organic molecules wrap themselves around sticky iron ions and chloride ions, crossing in just the right ways and at just the right points. The loose ends were then sealed together chemically, forming a completely tied knot with eight crossings. The number of crossings made the knot much tighter than anything that had ever been achieved before at the molecular level. The entire loop is tiny, the length of 192 atoms.David A. Leigh, a chemistry professor at the University of Manchester and a co-author of the study, said that while the technique was still some time away from any practical application, the potential is clear.“Knotting and weaving have led to breakthrough technologies since prehistoric times, when men first learned to make fishing nets or weave fabrics to keep warm,” he said. “Knots are just as important at the molecular level, but we can’t exploit them until we learn how to make them.”"
"What Should Senators Ask Scott Pruitt, Trump’s E.P.A. Nominee? Here’s What Readers Said","On Wednesday, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will consider President-elect Donald J. Trump’s choice  of Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma’s attorney general since 2011, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Pruitt spent much of his time in office fighting the Obama administration over the E.P.A.’s actions to regulate air and water pollution and to curb greenhouse gas emissions.The committee is led by Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, an outspoken contrarian on climate change, and includes several Republicans openly hostile to federal action to address it. The Democratic members of the committee include some of the Senate’s strongest supporters of the E.P.A. and most forceful voices for decisive action on climate change.We asked readers what questions they would ask if they could question Mr. Pruitt. More than 2,000 replied, and their answers largely fell into a few categories. Here is what some of them would like to know.Many readers seemed familiar with Mr. Pruitt’s statement that the science of climate change is “far from settled.” Most pointed out that an overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that climate change is happening and is caused by human activity, specifically by the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and asked for Mr. Pruitt’s sources for his position.Seth Rudman, 28, a scientific researcher at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, asked, “Can you describe the shortcomings of the scientific evidence for climate change and the type of data that would be needed to convince you that climate change is happening?”While being a scientist is not a requirement for the job, readers worried about what having a climate denialist at the top might mean for the agency.“During the Bush administration, climate scientists, including Dr. James Hansen, claimed that their voices were suppressed and their reports changed to minimize the role of humans in accelerating climate change and its impact,” wrote Donald Chartier, 60, the founder and chief executive of an internet company in Chicago. “Can you assure us that E.P.A. scientists will be allowed to present scientific evidence and data freely to the American people, without retaliation?”Others focused on the risk Mr. Pruitt was taking by denying the risks of climate change.“If the scientific consensus on climate change proves correct and the changes in the Earth’s weather cause widespread devastation, loss of life and property and great economic damage, who should be held responsible for staying the actions that might have prevented or ameliorated these outcomes?” asked Joseph Griffin, 72, a retiree from Bellefonte, Pa.During his time as attorney general of Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt has been seen by some to be cozy with the fossil fuel industry. He filed 14 suits against the E.P.A., challenging the agency’s environmental regulations, looking to soften the blow of federal policies against oil, gas, agriculture and other interests. In 13 of those cases, companies that had contributed money to Mr. Pruitt or to Pruitt-affiliated political campaign committees also signed on.Readers were concerned that Mr. Pruitt might continue to advance the interests of industry, possibly to the detriment of public health and safety.“How do you intend to serve the public need to protect the environment when you have demonstrated a preference for the rights of corporate shareholders?” asked Alison ten Cate, 50, an energy efficiency consultant from Belmont, Calif.Others wrote that Mr. Pruitt should be asked if he would be willing to disclose the companies and lobbyists that have given money to his campaigns, and agree to recuse himself from decisions involving them.Mr. Pruitt has argued that states are in a better position to regulate their environment and industries than the federal government, which he has accused of overreach.Many readers argued that air and water do not respect state borders, so it is the federal government’s responsibility to regulate these interstate issues.“You have worked against the E.P.A. in favor of managing interstate and global issues at the state level. Why?” asked Charles Haddox, 59, a marketing manager in Denver. “What success stories can you relate in detail showing states are more successful at protecting resources in the absence of federal regulation?”They also wondered where the limits of Mr. Pruitt’s federalism might lie.“Does your belief in federalism mean you will not interfere with the efforts of California and other states to address climate change?” wrote Michael McCabe, 19, a student at Sarah Lawrence College. “Or will you serve the interests of the fossil fuel industry and interfere with states’ efforts?”Some asked practical questions, like Mavis Negroni-Foosaner, 65, a part-time teacher and naturalist in Memphis, who wanted to know how Mr. Pruitt could continue to push for state and local jurisdiction of clean air and water “in light of the Flint, Mich., water scandal.” High levels of lead were found in the city’s water supply, largely a result of state and local regulatory failures, and the federal government had to intervene (some argue too late).Several readers seemed puzzled at why Mr. Pruitt would want to run a federal regulatory agency if he saw federal regulations as a problem, and wondered if he had other ideas for how to regulate pollutants. Some also would like to hear examples of success on environmental issues from his time in office in Oklahoma.Mark Baker, 48, an American who works for Diageo, an international beverage company, in Brussels, asked, “Can you provide an example of a policy that originated at the state or local level under your watch in Oklahoma and that resulted in cleaner water or air for Oklahoma’s citizens?”“Do you believe in protecting water, air and land from pollution?” wrote Sabina Gasper, 55, who works for the pharmaceutical industry in Bismarck, N.D. “Do you believe that regulations are the way to do this? If not, how should these resources be protected?”Some struck a more hopeful tone, like Lilian Howard, “nearing 80 years of age,” a retired travel consultant and writer from Virginia Beach, who wrote, “Would you briefly discuss a few actions by the E.P.A. which you believe were successful in protecting the American people and their natural surroundings from harm and how you might hope we can improve upon these during the new administration?”"
Running May Be Good for Your Knees,"Many people worry that running ruins knees. But a new study finds that the activity may in fact benefit the joint, changing the biochemical environment inside the knee in ways that could help keep it working smoothly.In my many decades as a runner, fellow runners and nonrunners alike have frequently told me that I am putting my knees at risk. The widespread argument generally follows the lines that running will slowly wear away the cartilage that cushions the bones in the joint and cause arthritis.But there is little evidence to support the idea, and a growing body of research that suggests the reverse. Epidemiological studies of long-term runners show that they generally are less likely to develop osteoarthritis in the knees than people of the same age who do not run.Some scientists have speculated that running may protect knees because it also often is associated with relatively low body mass. Carrying less weight is known to reduce the risk for knee arthritis.But other researchers have wondered whether running might have a more direct impact on knee joints, perhaps by altering the working of various cells inside the knee.To find out, researchers at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, recruited 15 male and female runners under the age of 30 with no history of knee injury or arthritis. The scientists wished to study people with healthy knees in order to better isolate running’s effects on otherwise normal joints.These volunteers visited a clinic where they had blood drawn from an arm. The researchers also siphoned off a small amount of synovial fluid, a lubricating fluid that reduces friction inside joints, from their right knee. Healthy knees contain only a soupçon of the stuff; arthritic and otherwise unhealthy knees tend to contain much more.The volunteers next were delivered, in wheelchairs, to the university’s nearby biomechanics lab. There, they either sat quietly for 30 minutes or ran on a treadmill for the same 30 minutes at their preferred running pace.After either running or sitting, they again were wheeled to the clinic and the blood and synovial fluid draws were repeated.Each volunteer completed both a sitting and running session on separate days.Then the researchers looked for a variety of substances in the young people’s blood and synovial fluid.In particular, they focused on molecules that are associated with inflammation. Low-grade inflammation in the knee has been shown to contribute to the development and progression of arthritis.So the researchers looked for changes in the levels of several types of cells that are known to either increase or blunt the amount of inflammation inside the knee.They also looked at changes in the levels of another substance unpoetically known as cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, or COMP. This substance tends to accumulate in diseased knees and is often used as a marker of incipient or worsening arthritis. People with arthritis can have about five times as much COMP in their synovial fluid as do people with healthy knees.Unfortunately, because it had turned out to be technically difficult to safely extract much synovial fluid from these healthy knees, the scientists wound up with complete numbers from only six of the runners.But the data were interesting and consistent. In almost every case, the runners’ knees showed substantially lower levels of two types of cells that can contribute to inflammation within the synovial fluid, compared to their baseline levels.The runners also showed a shift in their COMP levels. After the run, they displayed more of the substance in their blood and less in their synovial fluid. In effect, running seemed to have squeezed the molecules out of the knee and into the blood.Meanwhile, sitting had slightly increased levels of COMP inside people’s knees, and also raised the concentration of one of the inflammatory molecules.These findings suggest that a single half-hour session of running changes the interior of the knee, reducing inflammation and lessening levels of a marker of arthritis, says Robert Hyldahl, a professor of exercise science at B.Y.U. and lead author of the study, published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology.But sitting for 30 minutes also changed the knee, he points out, which he and his colleagues had not expected. Sitting seemed to make the knee biochemically more vulnerable to later disease.Dr. Hyldahl noted that this was a very small and short-term study. He and his colleagues would like to repeat it with much larger numbers, “once we figure out how to get more synovial fluid” safely from healthy knees, he says.They also hope to study longer running distances and different paces, to see how those variables affect changes within the knee, and to recruit older and injured runners, whose knees might have begun to respond fundamentally differently to the activity than the joints of healthy people in their 20s.But even with these limitations, the findings suggest that moderate amounts of running are “not likely to harm healthy knees and probably offer protection” against joint damage, Dr. Hyldahl says."
Rate of U.S. Abortions Hits Lowest Since Roe v. Wade,"The rate of abortions performed in the United States has fallen lower than during any year since 1973, when the Supreme Court legalized the procedure, according to a new report by the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.The latest numbers, for 2014, continue a trend of declining abortion rates for most years since 1981.In 2014, there were an estimated 926,200 abortions — a rate of 14.6 per 1,000 women of childbearing age (15 to 44) — compared with 1.06 million abortions in 2011, the year of the last Guttmacher report, or 16.9 per 1,000. In 1973, the year of the Roe v. Wade decision, the rate was 16.3. In 1981, the rate was 29.3.Researchers suggested that increased use of long-term birth control, such as intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants, contributed to the most recent decline. In particular, the proportion of clients at federally funded family planning clinics who sought such methods increased to 11 percent in 2014 from 7 percent in 2011. Because women who rely on these clinics are disproportionately young and poor and account for a majority of unintended pregnancies, researchers said, even a moderate increase in reliance on these methods could have an effect on the abortion rate.The impact of restrictive anti-abortion laws and the shuttering of clinics on abortion rates was unclear. For example, the abortion rate rose modestly in six states: Kansas, Arkansas, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina and Vermont. Yet between 2001 and 2014, with the exception of Vermont, all of these states introduced more restrictive abortion laws.“The underlying purpose of these restrictions was to reduce access to abortion, but clearly that doesn’t always happen,” said Rachel K. Jones, a principal research scientist at Guttmacher and the lead author of the report.Nationally, there was a 6 percent decline in the number of clinics performing abortions. In the Midwest, the percentage of closing clinics was 22 percent; in the South, 13 percent. By contrast, the percentage of clinics in the Northeast increased 14 percent.“But an increased number of clinics doesn’t mean you’re going to have more abortions,” said Ms. Jones.In New Jersey, the number of clinics rose to 41 in 2014 from 24 in 2011. Yet the number of abortions in the state during that period declined, to about 44,000 in 2014 from about 47,000 in 2011.For the first time, researchers asked about the incidence of self-induced abortion: 12 percent of clinics reported having treated at least one patient who had tried to end her own pregnancy."
"Most Primate Species Threatened With Extinction, Scientists Find","Our fellow primates are in trouble.In a study of unprecedented scope, a team of 31 primatologists has analyzed every known species of primate to judge how they are faring. The news for man’s closest animal relatives is not good.Three-quarters of primate species are in decline, the researchers found, and about 60 percent are now threatened with extinction. From gorillas to gibbons, primates are in significantly worse shape now than in recent decades because of the devastation from agriculture, hunting and mining.“I think we’re going to get quite a number of extinctions within next 50 years if things go on the way they are,” said Anthony B. Rylands, a senior research scientist at Conservation International and a co-author of the new study, which was published in Science Advances.“It’s a landmark paper,” said Anne D. Yoder, the director of the Duke Lemur Center, who was not involved in the study. “It’s alarming without being alarmist.”Taking stock of every primate species on Earth was a huge challenge, in part because scientists keep finding new ones. Since 2000, 85 new primate species have been identified, bringing the total to 505.Just last week, a team of researchers described a new species of gibbon in China. Dr. Rylands said he knows of at least seven new primate species to be announced this year.Scientists are finding so many new primate species in part because the destruction of forests is making it easier to reach populations that were once remote.“There is a certain rush of people in a panic, realizing that if they don’t find and describe them, they will be lost without us ever knowing them,” said Dr. Rylands.Another reason for the burst of discovery is that scientists have started investigating the DNA of primates, finding that some populations had unique mutations..“There are distinct species that have been around for millions of years, even though they look to our eyes very similar,” said Dr. Yoder. Unfortunately, she noted, new species revealed by DNA often turn out to exist in perilously low numbers.The new research was not all bad news for primates.“Some species are doing O.K.,” said Katherine C. MacKinnon, an anthropologist at Saint Louis University and a co-author of the study. “The ones that are doing O.K. are the ones that aren’t super-specialists, the ones that are most flexible.”But most species are not so flexible. Every species of ape (including gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans and 19 species of gibbons) is threatened, while 87 percent of lemur species are. Other species that are critically endangered include the brown-headed spider monkey of Ecuador, the Niger Delta red colobus, and the crested macaque, an Indonesian species famous for having taken a selfie with a photographer’s camera.“It’s worse than we thought 10 years ago,” Dr. MacKinnon said.She and her colleagues identified a number of human activities pushing primates to the edge, such as hunting. In West Africa, for example, there is a strong demand in local markets for primate meat.“The forests are still standing, but they’ve shot everything out of it,” said Dr. Rylands.The incentives to kill primates are not only local, though. A lot of primate meat is making its way to China, along with body parts falsely believed to have healing powers.“They’ll import enormous amounts from around Southeast Asia,” said Dr. Rylands. “They’re a driving force through the whole region.”Primates are also threatened by the wholesale destruction of forests to make way for agriculture. In the Amazon, the jungle is being converted to cattle ranches and soybean fields, while in Madagascar, rice paddies are taking the place of lemur forests.Western countries are also helping push primates toward extinction. Palm oil can be found in everything from doughnuts to lipstick to biodiesel fuel. New palm oil plantations are completely replacing forests in Southeast Asia — one of the most primate-diverse parts of the world.Even cellphones can add to the risks. In central Africa, miners go into rain forests to dig for an ore called coltan that ends up in phone circuits. Those miners hunt for their meals. “They live on primates,” said Dr. Rylands.Humans have already driven some primate species extinct, but it’s hard to say exactly how many. Madagascar was once home to giant lemurs that could weigh as much as 350 pounds.While Western scientists never laid eyes on these remarkable creatures, the fossil record shows that 17 lemur species became extinct after humans arrived there 2,000 years ago.More recently, a monkey called Miss Waldron’s red colobus has disappeared from its range in West Africa. It has not been spotted for over 25 years and is believed to be extinct. In China, a subspecies called the white-handed gibbon may have gone extinct as well.Some of the most endangered primate species are down to just a few dozen survivors. Their prospects are grim, because many of them live in parts of the world where human populations are projected to grow the fastest.In Madagascar, for example, humans may have to move deeper into lemur habitats for new farmland. “It’s a pressure cooker, and there’s no way to relieve the pressure,” said Dr. Yoder.The authors of the new study offer a number of reasons it is worth trying to halt the crisis.Recent research has shown that primates are extremely important to the ecosystems in which they live. As they feed on leaves and fruit, for example, they move pollen between trees. They pass seeds in their droppings, allowing plants to spread across a healthy range.“People used to think of primates as icing on the cake, as not being vital for ecosystems,” said Dr. MacKinnon. “But now we know they are.”Primates have also been invaluable for understanding ourselves.The first primates evolved roughly 80 million years ago, and then split into the living lineages over millions of years. By comparing our biology to those of other primates, we have learned about the evolution of our brains, our vision and our vulnerability to diseases.If those species become extinct, we will lose the opportunity to learn more.While the prospects are dire, Dr. Rylands said there were concrete steps that can be taken to help primates. “You have to stop hunting them and give them a place to live,” he said.That is easier said than done, he acknowledged, since the local communities where primates live are often struggling to feed their families. In some cases, it may be possible to take the pressure off primates by building fish farms as an alternate source of protein.In other cases, communities may be able to make more money over the long term from tourist operations in intact forests than from slash-and-burn agriculture.Dr. Rylands pointed to the golden lion tamarin as an example of how a primate species can be saved. It once lived in huge numbers in the Atlantic coastal forests of Brazil. After the forests were nearly wiped out to make way for sugar plantations and other forms of agriculture, the species nearly vanished.In 1983, the U.S. National Zoo led an international effort to bring them back. Monkeys were bred in captivity, forests were conserved and hunting was banned.Today, the species has a small but stable population of some 3,500 individuals in the wild.“There are cases where you can bring them back from the brink,” said Dr. Rylands. “But the immensity of the destruction of tropical forests makes it very difficult.”"
How Zoo Animals Learn to Help Take Care of Themselves,"This week, shortly after her 60th birthday, Colo, the first gorilla born in human care, died in her sleep. Part of the reason she lived so long — about 20 years longer than gorillas born in the wild — is because of the care she received.In zoos today, keepers work to reduce the stress of caregiving by training animals to be a part of their own care. Gorillas drink from bottles. Rhinos learn to get their teeth brushed. Lions are trained to get vaccines.The shooting of Harambe at the Cincinnati Zoo last May spurred debate about whether animals like gorillas even belong in zoos. But most zoo animals won’t be leaving anytime soon, and they require care that emphasizes their welfare if people want them to have long lives like Colo.It wasn’t always the case that zoos emphasized stress reduction in tending to their nonhuman charges. Animals were sedated, anesthetized or motivated with fear and dominance. Consider elephants. Back in the day keepers and elephants stood dangerously close to one another as part of a method called free contact. With this method, a keeper could motivate an elephant to do what was wanted with inhumane tools like food deprivation, prodding with bullhooks or roped restraints, said DJ Schubert, a wildlife biologist at the Animal Welfare Institute.Not all zoos have fully abandoned some outdated methods of managing their animals’ health. But the larger, accredited ones have taken lessons from updated methods for training elephants, and more animal trainers are using behavioral principles of learning and memory to shape behavior with rewards, reduce dangerous contact and allow animals some control in their own care.“We’re not going to be able to emulate what animals do in the wild,” said Dana Hatcher, a nutritionist at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Ohio, where Colo lived. “But we are trying to do things that help recreate these natural behaviors to the best of our abilities.”These are some of the ways animals in zoos and related dwellings can take part in their own care.In human care, a mother gorilla may not want or be able to care for her young. To get past this, zookeepers, like those at Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, become gorilla surrogates who stay with infants at all times.As part of a surrogacy program, human surrogates mimic the behavior of real mother gorillas. They cough like a gorilla when a baby does something out of line. They carry babies on their backs while crawling on their hands and knees. And just as mother gorillas do, the surrogates leave bits of food around their chest area for the baby to take. Through observational learning of these activities, gorillas that could become foster mothers to these infants learn behavior to take over their care.Zookeepers minimize human contact with the gorillas at the zoo by training infants to approach bottles rather than just receive them. The trainers do this by slowly putting the bottle farther away from the baby until it learns that it must get its own food.Animals in human care need shots or vaccines. And just like many humans, zoo animals do not like needles. But they can be trained not to mind.Getting lion cubs to tolerate needles for vaccines, for example, takes a lot of tiny, incremental steps. Often this starts when a trainer pairs a noise-making device called a clicker with a reward like food so often that the clicker eventually becomes an indicator of reward. Through behavioral shaping, the trainer can then click to reward every time an animal performs a behavior more and more like what is desired.To get lion cubs used to being around needles, trainers present a tiny, capped needle to the animal, then a bigger one, and so forth. Every time the animal allows this to happen, it receives a reward. The process can take a few weeks to months, depending on the animal.And to reduce fear of needles, trainers may expose a cub to a needle 100 times, and poke it only once. Within a year, the lion takes vaccines without much fuss.“They lean their shoulders into the keeper and the keeper injects the vaccine. It’s effortless, and it kind of looks magical,” said Adam Felts, a curator of African animals at Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. “The animals say: ‘Thanks. Can I get my food?’ And they walk away.”Through a procedure called target training, giraffes learn to associate a tennis ball on a stick with a reward, and to move different body parts in the direction of that target. A giraffe can follow a target and learn to put its foot on a block to receive hoof care.Through more shaping and rewards, black rhinos learn to let caregivers brush their teeth to prevent gum disease. By rewarding them with a big scratch, trainers can get them to hold still for dental care. In a similar way, keepers train polar bears to tolerate nail trims and eye drops.“They learn to cooperate. It’s kind of like a mutual agreement between the trainer and the animal,” Mr. Felts said. “When you’re training, you’re giving them things they want, and they learn over time and repetition that the keepers are able to do things with them to help assist with their care.”More than a dozen African species live together in a big field the Columbus Zoo calls a savanna to mimic the real one in Africa. When the weather is bad, or the animals need vitamins or checkups, they must return to the main zoo one species at a time, or stampedes and other dangerous events can occur.By pairing the sound of a musical instrument with a reward like food, the animals learn that when that sound is heard, it is time for their species to congregate and move in. Lions respond to a bullhorn. Giraffes respond to a bell. And the wildebeests, which are always last to go inside, come to the shake of a tambourine. Some of the animals are so well trained that they start lining up as soon as they see the keepers’ vehicle pull into the savanna."
Think You Have Asthma? You Might Not,"Many adults who believe they have asthma actually may not.Using random dialing, Canadian researchers recruited 613 men and women who had been given a diagnosis of asthma within the past five years. Then over four visits they gave them a series of drug challenges and spirometry, a physical test of breathing capacity, to confirm or rule out the disorder. The study is in JAMA.The researchers were able to rule out asthma in 203, or about a third of subjects, most of whom were taking asthma medicine. They tapered their medicine, and 181 of them showed no signs of asthma over a 15-month follow-up.In about 2 percent of cases, the researchers found another breathing issue that may have been misdiagnosed as asthma. In about half of cases, the diagnosis was based on symptoms alone, with no objective laboratory testing. Spontaneous remission explained a number of other cases.The lead author, Dr. Shawn D. Aaron, a professor of medicine at the University of Ottawa, said that a cough or a wheeze is not enough to diagnose asthma and put a person on inhaled steroids.“If you have shortness of breath, wheeze or cough, you should suggest that the doctor order a spirometry test,” he said. “It’s a quick test with no risks or side effects that can predict asthma or other respiratory conditions.”"
G.O.P. Governors Seek Flexibility on Medicaid and Health Markets,"WASHINGTON — Republican governors pleaded with their fellow Republicans in Congress on Thursday to give states more control over both their Medicaid programs and their individual health insurance markets as lawmakers work with President-elect Donald J. Trump to replace the Affordable Care Act.In town for Mr. Trump’s inauguration, nine governors — some who had expanded Medicaid under the law and some who had refused — presented a united message: The Obama administration was too rigid in prescribing standards for Medicaid and private insurance coverage, and states need more power to set their own policies.Many had already sent letters to Republican lawmakers urging them not to repeal the law before approving a replacement plan, and in comments after Thursday’s session they focused on the details of what that replacement plan should be.Given greater flexibility to set their own policies, several governors said, they would like to trim the number of people in Medicaid and the array of benefits offered in both the public program and private plans sold in the markets.Yet at the same time, some, including John R. Kasich of Ohio and Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, are lobbying to keep the generous federal financing provided by the law for expanding Medicaid. Mr. Hutchinson and Mr. Kasich have indicated they would like to reduce their Medicaid expansion populations while still having the federal government pay at least 90 percent of the cost of covering those who remain in the program.Medicaid is the nation’s largest government health insurance program, serving 22 percent of the population — more than 70 million people — at a cost of more than $500 billion a year. Before the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid recipients were largely children, parents, pregnant women and the elderly and disabled.The law sought to change that by requiring every state to expand Medicaid to cover anyone with income up to 138 percent of the poverty level, or about $16,500 for a single adult. But the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of the provision, and many Republican-led states did so.Still, 16 of the 31 states that expanded Medicaid under the law have Republican governors who now must decide whether to fight to preserve the size and scope of their programs in the Trump era.The law offered a major financial enticement to lure states into expanding Medicaid: The federal government paid the entire cost for the first three years. Although states are beginning to pay a small portion of expansion costs this year, they are never required to pay more than 10 percent under the terms of the Affordable Care Act.Some Republican governors have also expressed tentative support for Mr. Trump’s proposal to change federal spending on Medicaid from an open-ended entitlement to a fixed annual amount, or block grant, for each state. Critics say block grants could result in states cutting people from the Medicaid rolls or reducing the services they get.“The difference between a good block grant and a dangerous block grant is in the detail,” Mr. Kasich wrote to congressional leaders recently.Gov. Rick Scott of Florida told reporters outside the meeting room on Capitol Hill that he wanted the Trump administration to give him a set amount for each Medicaid beneficiary, but that the amounts should differ depending on the beneficiary’s health needs. “Individuals with different problems, there are different costs involved,” he said.Referring to the Department of Health and Human Services, Mr. Scott added, “It was frustrating to me under Obamacare, where the H.H.S. didn’t appear to have any interest in working with me. They said, ‘You should do this and do it all 100 percent on my terms.’”Mr. Hutchinson said he was “very, very pleased” with the meeting with senators, which also included Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will play a large role in writing legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act. Governors held a separate meeting with Republican members of Mr. Walden’s committee.“Whenever you see senators and Chairman Walden taking notes on what governors are saying, that’s a significant day for the principle of federalism,” Mr. Hutchinson said.In addition to Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Kasich and Mr. Scott, the governors of Idaho, Iowa, Michigan, South Dakota, Texas and Utah attended the meeting.In letters before the meeting, the governors also warned Congress not to do anything that would disrupt coverage for people who have gained it under the health law.“We support a single repeal-and-replace package, but are concerned that a strategy to repeal now then later replace the A.C.A. could have serious consequences,” Mr. Kasich wrote. He added that such consequences could include destabilizing the insurance markets and reversing recent coverage gains."
Tasmanian Tigers’ Brains Yield Clues Long After Extinction,"The tale of the Tasmanian tiger was tragic. Once numerous across Tasmania, the doglike marsupial was branded a sheep killer by colonists in the 1830s and hunted to extinction. The last of its kind, Benjamin, died in a zoo in 1936, and with it many secrets into the animals’ lives were lost.The striped creature, which is also known as the thylacine, was hardly studied when it was alive, depriving scientists of understanding the behavior of an important predator from Australia’s recent biological past. Now, for the first time, researchers have performed neural scans on the extinct carnivore’s brain, revealing insights that had been lost since the species went extinct.“Part of the myth about them is what exactly did they eat, how did they hunt and were they social?” said Dr. Gregory Berns, a neuroscientist at Emory University and lead author on the study, which was published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. “These are questions nobody really knows the answers to.”Dr. Berns’s main research pertains to dogs and the inner workings of the canine brain, but after learning more about Tasmanian tigers, he became fascinated by the beasts.With their slender bodies, long snouts and sharp teeth, Tasmanian tigers looked as if they could be related to dogs, wolves or coyotes. But actually they are separated by more than 150 million years of evolution. It is a classic example of convergent evolution, in which two organisms that are not closely related develop similar features because of the environment they adapted to and the ecological role they played.To better understand thylacines, Dr. Berns spent two years tracking down two preserved Tasmanian tiger brains, one at the Smithsonian Institution and the other at the Australian Museum. Their brains, like those of all marsupials, are very different from the brains of placental mammals. The biggest difference is that they lack a corpus callosum, which is the part of the brain that connects the left and right hemispheres.Because of the differences, Dr. Berns said, if he wanted to make any sense out of the Tasmanian tiger brain, he could not compare it with one of his dog brain scans. Instead, he needed to analyze it against something much more similar.“That’s where the devil comes into the picture,” Dr. Berns said.The Tasmanian devil, a carnivorous marsupial that mostly scavenges for food, is one of the Tasmanian tiger’s closest living relatives. Dr. Berns collected two Tasmanian devil brains, scanned them and compared them with the two Tasmanian tiger brains.For the brain scans, he used magnetic resonance imaging to study the gray matter, and diffusion tensor imaging to study the white matter. From the scans Dr. Berns found that Tasmanian tigers had a larger brain, particularly the frontal lobes.The differences suggested that Tasmanian tigers were smarter than Tasmanian devils and used their cortex more for planning and decision-making, Dr. Berns said. That, he said, further supported the idea that Tasmanian tigers were avid hunters, rather than scavengers like Tasmanian devils.Leah Krubitzer, a neuroscientist from the University of California, Davis, who was not involved in the study, called the work a “heroic effort” for scanning brains of the extinct animal.“The authors cleverly used the best available techniques to examine brain organization in nonliving brains that were in not very good condition,” she said.And Dr. Berns said his research could change our understanding of these extinct Australian predators.“Go back 100 years, people dismissed thylacines as stupid animals because they weren’t fast moving,” he said. He added that what he could see of the Tasmanian tigers’ brains revealed that “they were probably quite intelligent.”"
Exercise Can Be a Boon to People With Parkinson’s Disease,"Susan Sills, a Brooklyn artist who until recently made life-size cutouts on plywood using a power saw, long suspected she might be at risk for developing Parkinson’s disease. Both her mother and grandfather had this neurological movement disorder, and she knew that it sometimes runs in families.So she was not surprised when at age 72 she first noticed hand tremors and a neurologist confirmed that she had the disease. But to watch her in action three years later, it would be hard for a layperson to tell. She stands straight, walks briskly, speaks in clarion tones and maintains a schedule that could tire someone half her age.Having wisely put the power saw aside, Ms. Sills now makes intricately designed art jewelry. She is also a docent at the Brooklyn Museum, participates in a cooperative art gallery and assists her husband’s business by entertaining customers.Ms. Sills attributes her energy and well-being partly to the medication she takes but primarily to the hours she spends working out with a physical therapist and personal trainer, who have helped her develop an exercise regimen that, while not a cure, can alleviate Parkinson’s symptoms and slow progression of the disease.“The exercises opened me up,” said Ms. Sills, allowing such symptoms as small steps, slow movements and tiny, cramped handwriting to subside.“The earlier people begin exercising after a Parkinson’s diagnosis, and the higher the intensity of exercise they achieve, the better they are,” Marilyn Moffat, a physical therapist on the faculty of New York University, said. “Many different activities have been shown to be beneficial, including cycling, boxing, dancing and walking forward and backward on a treadmill. If someone doesn’t like one activity, there are others that can have equally good results.”Unfortunately, Dr. Moffat added, “no one tells people with Parkinson’s what they could and should be doing unless they get to a physical therapist.” The typical delay in starting an effective exercise program also stems from the ability of medication to alleviate early symptoms, leaving patients with little incentive to exercise.While everyone can benefit from exercise, it is especially important for people with a progressive movement disorder like Parkinson’s that can result in weakness, stiffness, difficulty walking, poor balance and falls, as well as impaired cognitive processing. Regular exercise bestows increased levels of fitness; a greater sense of well-being; stronger muscles and bones; healthier joints; more efficient breathing; and better digestion and blood circulation. The result is enhanced physical, mental and cognitive health, all of which are especially important to people with a chronic ailment.For Parkinson’s patients in particular, regular exercise tailored to their needs can result in better posture; less stiffness; improved flexibility of muscles and joints; faster and safer walking ability; less difficulty performing the tasks of daily living; and an overall higher quality of life.Patients who participate in exercise programs designed to mitigate symptoms and perhaps delay progression of Parkinson’s “can function independently at a higher level, have stronger feelings of well-being, and are happier about their quality of life,” said Dr. Moffat, who has witnessed major improvements in people she’s worked with.Among the many exercise options is an agility program that incorporates the principles of tai chi, kayaking, boxing, lunges and Pilates. It was developed and proved safe and effective by Laurie A. King and Fay B. Horak at Oregon Health and Sciences University. The agility course includes navigating turns, doorways, hallways and small areas; tasks like walking with knees high and hands touching them; skipping; and shuffling from side to side.In a report on their work in Physical Therapy, the journal of the American Physical Therapy Association, Dr. King and Dr. Horak explained that intense exercise can improve “plasticity” of the brain, protect against nervous system degeneration, and even reverse motor deficits.Another program, called Rock Steady Boxing, was founded by Scott C. Newman, a former prosecutor in Marion County, Ind., who developed Parkinson’s at age 40. He reported significant improvements in his physical health, agility, daily functioning and quality of life shortly after he began high-energy workouts doing boxing moves a few years after his diagnosis.Mr. Newman has pointed out that Parkinson’s is not a muscle wasting disease. Rather, the brain forgets how to tell the muscles what to do. He believed it should be possible to teach the brain to get muscles to work more effectively, which is what Rock Steady Boxing and other exercise programs for Parkinson’s disease seem to have achieved.While it is best to begin a challenging exercise program early in the disease, Dr. Moffat and Mr. Newman say it can help at any stage. Rock Steady Boxing, for example, has created training programs suited to fitness levels at all stages of Parkinson’s.Another personal experience, by a cross-country cyclist, resulted in a tandem cycling program for Parkinson’s patients. In a 200-mile trip across Iowa in 2003, Jay Alberts, a biomedical engineer at the Cleveland Clinic, pedaled in the lead position with a woman who has Parkinson’s. The pace he set forced her to pedal a third faster than she would have done on her own. The woman’s tremors disappeared while she was pedaling with Dr. Alberts, and he later showed in a controlled study that the ability of forced pedaling to suppress Parkinson’s symptoms can persist for weeks afterward.Dr. Alberts suspects that the high-intensity exercise changes how the brain processes movement, resulting in improved motor function over all. The benefits of tandem cycling can be achieved indoors and out, even without a biking partner.The exercise program that has mainly helped Ms. Sills, called L.S.V.T. BIG, evolved from the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment program – L.S.V.T. LOUD — created to improve the speech of Parkinson’s patients, who tend to talk more and more softly. Developed specifically to counter the unique movement impairments associated with Parkinson’s, it trains patients to “make big strong movements, not little weak ones,” Ms. Sills said, for example, taking big steps and swinging your arms widely when you walk. “This is the normal way to walk, but not when you have Parkinson’s, but it no longer feels strange to me,” she said.Other programs tailored to benefit Parkinson’s patients include ParkFit, which fosters a more active lifestyle; Dance for PD, which has classes in every New York City borough and many other countries; and Microsoft Kinect Adventures, which uses Xbox games geared to different stages of the disease."
Ancient Bits of Rock Help Solve an Asteroid Mystery,"An asteroid is a smaller-than-a-planet rock orbiting in the inner solar system. A meteor is the streak of light of a space rock plunging into the atmosphere, and a meteorite is the remnant of space rock that survives the fiery descent and comes to rest on the ground.Thus, one might think that meteorites that fall on Earth ought to be just like the asteroids that pass through Earth’s neighborhood.“That’s what everybody would have expected,” said Philipp R. Heck, the curator in charge for the meteorite and physical geology collections at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.Planetary scientists were surprised almost a decade ago when they discovered that the most plentiful types of meteorites they had collected and studied on Earth were actually not common in space.In a paper published Monday by the journal Nature Astronomy, an international team of researchers led by Dr. Heck says it has uncovered part of the explanation. Mineralogical evidence in some meteorites had already pointed to a cataclysmic collision in the asteroid belt about 466 million years ago — long before dinosaurs, when multicellular animals were still fairly new. (Dr. Heck estimated that any skywatchers back then would have seen about 100 times as many shooting stars as crisscross the night sky today.)Dr. Heck and his colleagues wanted to examine meteorites that landed on Earth before that, and for that they looked at ancient limestone from Russia — one-time sediment of a seafloor transformed to rock — that was about a million years older.They dissolved almost 600 pounds of rock to extract 46 minuscule crystals containing the mineral chromite. The crystals persist unchanged for hundreds of millions of years, and from the mix of elements in the crystals, the scientists could tell that 41 of them came from space and what types of asteroids they were once part of.The mix of meteorites was very different. Back then, more than a third of them belonged to a type known as primitive achondrites; today, less than half a percent of them are.“It’s really inventive, their approach,” said Tasha L. Dunn, a geology professor at Colby College in Maine who studies meteorites and who was not involved in the research.The findings fits in with the new understanding that a mix of meteorites is determined more by the history of collisions in the asteroid belt rather than by the mix of asteroids whose orbits around the sun are close to Earth’s.“It opens new roads of research,” Pierre Vernazza, a researcher at the Laboratory of Astrophysics of Marseille, France, who first noted the discrepancy between asteroids and meteorites in 2008, said of the new paper.For one, many of the achondrites then came from Vesta, a large asteroid that suffered a powerful impact about a billion years ago. But then there are other achondrites that did not. “In the case of the other achondrites, we don’t have any well-known source so far,” Dr. Vernazza said."
"For 5 Contest Finalists, a $20 Million Dash to the Moon","The surface of the moon may soon be dotted with corporate logos, and its craters labeled with slogans. Families might be able to send their loved ones’ ashes — or even their pets’ remains — for lunar burial.Entrepreneurs hope that commercial ventures expand in lucrative ways in later years. In a farther, fanciful future, for example, the moon could be mined for platinum, a valuable metal, or helium-3, to be used as fuel for fusion energy reactors that do not yet exist.Private access to the moon grew a little closer to reality on Tuesday, when the X Prize Foundation, with prizes financed by Google, chose five teams of private entrepreneurs who say they can get to the moon by the end of this year.If any of them succeeds — the deadline has been pushed back several times — it could usher in an era of extraterrestrial commerce and renew interest in our long-ignored moon.“It’s incentivized this whole business of the niche space economy,” said Chanda Gonzales-Mowrer, a senior director at the X Prize Foundation, which runs the contest.The five finalist teams span the globe: Moon Express in the United States, Hakuto in Japan, SpaceIL in Israel, Team Indus in India, and Synergy Moon, an international collaboration.The X Prize Foundation was founded by Peter H. Diamandis, an entrepreneur who wanted to use competitions to encourage technological innovation in the way that aviation prizes in the early 20th century helped transform airplanes from a dangerous avocation of barnstormers to a commonplace mode of transportation.The first X Prize award of $10 million in 2004 went to the first private spaceship that could take people 62 miles up, into outer space. That led to the founding of Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, which aims to take tourists to the edge of space for a few minutes of weightlessness.The foundation began a similar competition in 2007 to point attention to the moon. To win the top $20 million prize, a spacecraft must land on the moon, move 500 meters and send back video and photographs. The second team to accomplish the task wins $5 million. The contest also offers $5 million in bonus prizes, for feats like surviving the cold lunar night and traveling more than 5,000 meters on the surface.The next 11 months are a dash to finish team designs, assemble spacecraft and prepare for launching. And the teams differ on their approaches.Rahul Narayan, the leader of Team Indus, said the engineers had to develop their own computer, software, power system and other components when the initial approach of buying off-the-shelf satellite parts did not work out, increasing costs. Mr. Narayan now estimates the price tag at $70 million to $75 million.The Hakuto team, with a $10 million budget, is not building a lander at all, but hitching a ride for its rover with Team Indus. If Team Indus is the first to land on the moon, its rover and Hakuto’s will race to travel the 500 meters to capture the $20 million prize. Both rovers have a top speed of about 4 inches a second.“We think that we can beat them on the moon,” said Takeshi Hakamada, the leader of Hakuto (pronounced HOCK-tow).For SpaceIL and Synergy Moon, the main goal is not starting a business, but inspiring the next generation. “Kind of like Jacques Cousteau did with ocean exploration,” said Kevin Myrick, a founder of Synergy Moon.Eran Privman, the chief executive of SpaceIL, said attracting the interest of venture capitalists would have been difficult for the company, because the return on investment would have been a couple of decades in the future. So instead of trying to be a profitable business, his team seeks to inspire children in Israel. “Just like Apollo in the United States in the ’60s,” he said.Moon Express, based in Cape Canaveral, Fla., has followed a more conventional business path, soliciting investors. It is building a scaled-down lander to fit into a small, $5 million rocket called Electron, developed by a start-up company, Rocket Lab.It will carry a reflecting mirror experiment that bounces back laser beams from Earth, the same type of experiment that Apollo astronauts left behind on the moon. The lead scientist for the experiment, Douglas Currie, a retired physicist from the University of Maryland, was a key member of the Apollo laser experiments.SpaceIL and Moon Express are eschewing rovers. To fulfill the 500-meter requirement, both instead intend to have their landers lift off and land again.And the companies all still face challenges. Moon Express’s ride, the Electron, has yet to launch even once. “It’s not a blind bet,” Mr. Richards said, but he conceded that it was also not a sure thing. Synergy Moon also plans to launch on an unproven rocket.Yet even some of teams that have dropped out have not given up.Two former competitors, Astrobotic Technology of Pittsburgh and Part-Time Scientists in Berlin are continuing with their moon plans, just not by the end of this year.Astrobotic, which now plans to launch its spacecraft in 2019, has announced partnerships with DHL, the delivery company, and signed up customers for its trips including Elysium Space, which plans to offer the possibility of sending human remains to the moon. “The X Prize is not really the core driving thing anymore,” said John Thornton, Astrobotic’s chief executive.Robert Boehme, the leader of Part-Time scientists, said his team — which is backed by Audi, the carmaker — had a contract to launch in mid-2018. “It’s too risky to try to accelerate it,” he said.Its rover will have the four-ring Audi logo on the front and be called the Audi lunar quattro, echoing the name of one of Audi’s cars."
North America’s Geographical Center May Be in a North Dakota Town Called Center,"In 1931, the town of Rugby, N.D., erected a 15-foot stone monument declaring itself the “Geographical Center of North America.” For 85 years, the town has enjoyed a steady stream of tourists to the monument and local gift shops.But recently, Rugby received an unwelcome challenge, from a bar about 100 miles south. “By our calculations, the center of North America is in Robinson, a couple feet outside Hanson’s Bar,” said Bill Bender, the owner of Hanson’s and mayor of Robinson, N.D., which has a population of 40. “We have as much claim to it as anybody does.”Now the science of geography may prove them both wrong. When Peter Rogerson, a geography professor at the University at Buffalo, heard about the kerfuffle, he decided to weigh in. In 2015, he had published a new method for calculating geographic centers. Using this method, he found that the continental center was in a town called (wait for it) Center, N.D. By car, Center is 145 miles southwest of Rugby and 90 miles west of Robinson.The novelty of Dr. Rogerson’s method is the map projection he used. Map projections transform Earth’s three-dimensional surface into two dimensions. The process always introduces some distortion, in shape, area, distance or direction. Perhaps the most well-known projection is the Mercator, which greatly distorts size, showing Greenland at roughly the same size as Africa, when Africa is 14 times as big. Another projection, the Mollweide, preserves size, but distorts shape, direction and distance.To calculate geographic centers, Dr. Rogerson uses the azimuthal equidistant projection, which accurately shows distances and angles from its center, at the expense of shape and size toward its edges. (Think of the flag of the United Nations, centered on the North Pole.) With accurate distances, Dr. Rogerson can calculate the point at which the sum of squared distances to all other points in the region would be smallest — the mathematical definition of a geographic center.“When I ran my computer program and looked at the final latitude and longitude, I was astounded to see that it was in a place called Center,” he said of calculating the midpoint of North America.It’s not hard to argue that Dr. Rogerson’s claim is more precise than Rugby’s and Mr. Bender’s.Rugby snatched the title of geographic center after the United States Geological Survey reported in 1931 that the heart of North America was six miles west of a town called Balta, N.D., which is 16 miles southwest of Rugby. Back then, geographers balanced a cardboard cutout of a region on a needlelike point to find its center — not the most sophisticated approach.Mr. Bender said that one night he and some buddies in Robinson realized over beer and bourbon that the Geological Survey’s center wasn’t in Rugby. So they eyeballed North America’s center using a ruler on several different maps. “It was trial and error,” he said. “I can’t give you an exact formula.”Last summer, Mr. Bender registered Hanson’s Bar as the owner of the phrase “Geographical Center of North America” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Rugby’s registration had expired in 2009, when the town failed to file a renewal. A decal that reads “Geographic Center of North America” now sits on the floor of the bar, and Mr. Bender plans to build a monument outside.When word got out that Mr. Bender had nabbed the federal trademark, some residents in Rugby were concerned. “It’s been our main tourism draw for so long,” said Cathy Jelsing, director of the local Prairie Village Museum, who added that the town had just spent $5,000 sprucing up its stone monument.Officials from Rugby declined to comment, but Mr. Bender said he received a letter from the town’s lawyer, asking him to rethink his actions. Mr. Bender said he would prefer to settle things in a more civilized fashion — like a “charity boxing match” between mayors.It’s possible that Rugby has a case, said Josh Gerben, a trademark lawyer and founder of Gerben Law Firm, based in Washington. “If you use a trademark for long enough that people get to know you as the place where the trademark originates from, you have what’s called common law rights,” said Mr. Gerben, who has no stake in the conflict.People in Center are excited about Dr. Rogerson’s finding, said Rick Schmidt, a county extension agent and longtime Center resident.“We are basically a mining and agriculture community, and we just don’t have a lot of tourism opportunities right now,” he said. “For us to tap into something like this, I think it’d be very significant.”Mr. Schmidt added that the town, which has 570 residents and gets its name from being the center of Oliver County, hoped to embrace its status as continental center without stepping on Rugby’s toes. If it came down to a fight, though, he says he thinks Center would pursue legal action, “if we feel we have a good case.”Theoretically, science could be used in court to challenge Rugby’s and Robinson’s claims. Expert testimony from Dr. Rogerson and other scientists could be used to challenge a trademark claim on the grounds that it is deceptive, Mr. Gerben said.That may be easier said than done, though — the final decision would be up to a judge or a jury, and Dr. Rogerson’s findings have no official backing. Past Geological Survey reports have stated that “there is no generally accepted definition of geographic center, and no completely satisfactory method for determining it.”If the government were to change its mind, however, Dr. Rogerson’s method would be the way to go, said Francis Boscoe, a professor at the University at Albany who once calculated the center of Pennsylvania (which, incidentally, is in a county called Centre).“If I were going to build a monument, I’d pick his spot,” Dr. Boscoe said. “As far as what you can do while sitting at your desk, his method is about as good as you can do.”"
Get Up and Move. It May Make You Happier.,"When people get up and move, even a little, they tend to be happier than when they are still, according to an interesting new study that used cellphone data to track activities and moods. In general, the researchers found, people who move are more content than people who sit.There already is considerable evidence that physical activity is linked to psychological health. Epidemiological studies have found, for example, that people who exercise or otherwise are active typically are less prone to depression and anxiety than sedentary people.But many of these studies focused only on negative moods. They often also relied on people recalling how they had felt and how much they had moved or sat in the previous week or month, with little objective data to support these recollections.For the new study, which was published this month in PLoS One, researchers at the University of Cambridge in England decided to try a different approach. They would look, they decided, at correlations between movement and happiness, that most positive of emotions. In addition, they would look at what people reported about their activity and compare it with objective measures of movement.To accomplish these goals, they first developed a special app for Android phones. Available free on the Google app store and ultimately downloaded by more than 10,000 men and women, it was advertised as helping people to understand how lifestyle choices, such as physical activity, might affect people’s moods. (The app, which is no longer available for download, opened with a permission form explaining to people that the data they entered would be used for academic research.)The app randomly sent requests to people throughout the day, asking them to enter an estimation of their current mood by answering questions and also using grids in which they would place a dot showing whether they felt more stressed or relaxed, depressed or excited, and so on.Periodically, people were also asked to assess their satisfaction with life in general.After a few weeks, when people were comfortable with the app, they began answering additional questions about whether, in the past 15 minutes, they had been sitting, standing, walking, running, lying down or doing something else.They also were asked about their mood at that moment.At the same time, during the 17 months of the study, the app gathered data from the activity monitor that is built into almost every smartphone today. In essence, it checked whether someone’s recall of how much he or she had been moving in the past quarter-hour tallied with the numbers from the activity monitor.In general, the information provided by users and the data from activity monitors was almost exactly the same.Of greater interest to the researchers, people using the app turned out to feel happier when they had been moving in the past quarter-hour than when they had been sitting or lying down, even though most of the time they were not engaged in rigorous activity.In fact, most of the physical activity that people reported was gentle walking, with little running, cycling or other more strenuous exercise.But the links between moving in any way and feeling happy were consistent for most people throughout the day, according to the data from their apps. It also didn’t matter whether it was a workday or weekend.The researchers also found that people who moved more frequently tended to report greater life satisfaction over all than those who reported spending most of their time in a chair.In general, the results suggest that “people who are generally more active are generally happier and, in the moments when people are more active, they are happier,” says Gillian Sandstrom, a study co-author who was a postdoctoral researcher at Cambridge and is now a lecturer in psychology at the University of Essex.In other words, moving and happiness were closely linked, both in the short term and longer term.Of course, this type of study does not establish causation. It cannot tell us whether being more active actually causes us to become happier or, conversely, whether being happy causes us to move more. It only shows that more activity goes hand-in-hand with greater happiness.The study also is limited by its reliance on cellphone data, Dr. Sandstrom says, because it may not have captured information about formal exercise. People often do not carry their phones when they run, cycle or engage in other types of vigorous activity, she and her colleagues point out in the study. So those types of workouts would not be reflected in the app or the phones’ activity monitor, making it impossible to know from this data set whether formal exercise is linked to happiness, for better or worse.Still, the size of the study group and the consistency of the findings are compelling, Dr. Sandstrom says. They do indicate that if you get up and move often, you are more likely to feel cheerful than if you do not."
"Doomsday Clock Moves Closer to Midnight, Signaling Concern Among Scientists","It is getting closer to midnight.On Thursday, the group of scientists who orchestrate the Doomsday Clock, a symbolic instrument informing the public when the earth is facing imminent disaster, moved its minute hand from three to two and a half minutes before the final hour.It was the closest the clock had been to midnight since 1953, the year after the United States and the Soviet Union conducted competing tests of the hydrogen bomb.Though scientists decide on the clock’s position, it is not a scientific instrument, or even a physical one. The movement of its symbolic hands is decided upon by the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The organization introduced the clock on the cover of its June 1947 edition, placing it at seven minutes to midnight. Since then, it has moved closer to midnight and farther away, depending on the board’s conclusions.Thursday’s announcement was made by Rachel Bronson, the executive director and publisher of the bulletin. She was assisted by the theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss, the climate scientist and meteorologist David Titley, and the former United States ambassador Thomas Pickering.Dr. Bronson, in a post-announcement interview, explained why the board had included the 30-second mark in the measurement. She said that it was an attention-catching signal that was meant to acknowledge “what a dangerous moment we’re in, and how important it is for people to take note.”“We’re so concerned about the rhetoric, and the lack of respect for expertise, that we moved it 30 seconds,” she said. “Rather than create panic, we’re hoping that this drives action.”In an op-ed for The New York Times, Dr. Titley and Dr. Krauss elaborated on their concerns, citing the increasing threats of nuclear weapons and climate change, as well as President Trump’s pledges to impede what they see as progress on both fronts, as reasons for moving the clock closer to midnight.“Never before has the Bulletin decided to advance the clock largely because of the statements of a single person,” they wrote. “But when that person is the new president of the United States, his words matter.”The board has held the responsibility for the clock’s movements since 1973, when the bulletin’s editor, Eugene Rabinowitch, died. Composed of scientists, and nuclear and climate experts, the board meets biannually to discuss where the clock’s hands should fall in light of world events.In the 1950s, the scientists feared nuclear annihilation, and since then, the board has begun to consider other existential threats, including climate change, compromised biosecurity and artificial intelligence.There were crises that the clock was not quick enough to take into account. The Cuban Missile Crisis, for instance, in 1962, did not change the hands of the clock, which at the time stood at seven minutes to midnight.An explanation on the Bulletin’s website accounts for this seeming lapse in timekeeping: “The Cuban Missile Crisis, for all its potential and ultimate destruction, only lasted a few weeks,” it says. “However, the lessons were quickly apparent when the United States and the Soviet Union installed the first hotline between the two capitals to improve communications, and, of course, negotiated the 1963 test ban treaty, ending all atmospheric nuclear testing.”The end of the Cold War came as a relief to those who had lived in fear of nuclear annihilation for decades, and the minute hand slowly moved away from danger. In 1990, it was at 10 minutes to midnight. The next year, it was a full 17 minutes away, at the relatively undisturbing time of 11:43.“The illusion that tens of thousands of nuclear weapons are a guarantor of national security has been stripped away,” the Bulletin said at the time.But over the next two decades the clock slowly ticked back. Conflict between India and Pakistan, both of whom staged nuclear weapons tests three weeks apart, had the clock at nine minutes to midnight in 1998. By 2007, fears about Iranian and North Korean nuclear capacity had pushed it to 11:55.By 2015, the scientists were back in a state of unmitigated concern, with the clock at three minutes to midnight, the closest it had been since 1984.“Unchecked climate change, global nuclear weapons modernizations, and outsized nuclear weapons arsenals pose extraordinary and undeniable threats to the continued existence of humanity,” the bulletin said. “World leaders have failed to act with the speed or on the scale required to protect citizens from potential catastrophe.”“These failures of political leadership endanger every person on Earth,” it added."
Depression and Anxiety Tied to Cancer Deaths,"Psychological distress may increase your chances of dying from cancer.Researchers interviewed 163,363 adults in England and Scotland using well-validated questionnaires on general and mental health. They followed the population in 16 studies conducted between 1994 and 2008.After controlling for age, smoking, physical activity and other factors, they found that compared with those with the lowest scores on depression and anxiety, those with the highest had higher rates of cancer death. The associations were particularly strong for colon and rectal, prostate, pancreatic and esophageal cancers, and for leukemia. In instances of colorectal and prostate cancer, they found a “dose-response” effect: the greater the distress, the greater the likelihood of death from those cancers.People might have had undiagnosed cancer at the start of the study, which would affect their mood, so the researchers accounted for this possibility by doing an analysis that excluded study members who died of cancer in the first five years. The results were largely the same.The study, in BMJ, is observational so cannot determine cause and effect, and it depended in part on self-reports. “The extent to which these associations could be causal,” the authors write, “requires further testing with alternative study designs.”"
Nursing Home Residents Gain New Protections,"If you had to give the nation’s nursing homes a letter grade for quality, what would it be?Experts tend to sigh at this question and point out, correctly, that the country’s 15,600 facilities are vastly different — rural and urban, for-profit and nonprofit and government-run, home to the reasonably healthy and the extremely sick, high-quality operations and appalling ones. Assigning grades can be folly.But when prodded, they come up with decidedly middling assessments. Dr. Cheryl Phillips, head of public policy for LeadingAge, which represents 2,200 nonprofit nursing homes: C-minus.Nicholas Castle, a health policy researcher at the University of Pittsburgh: B-minus.Robyn Grant, public policy director at the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, a leading advocacy group: No grade. “Far too many have a long way to go to give residents the quality of care and quality of life they deserve.”I asked because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services last fall issued a broad revision of nursing home regulations; the first batch took effect in late November, with the rest to be phased in this year and in 2019.“These are the first comprehensive updates to long-term care requirements since 1991,” said Dr. Kate Goodrich, the centers’ chief medical officer. They emerged from a four-year process involving many meetings and almost 10,000 comments from interested parties.Will the new requirements help improve care for the country’s 1.4 million nursing home residents — perhaps raise the report card grade to a solid B? “From our perspective, it’s a mixed bag,” Ms. Grant said.Residents and families will most likely appreciate some of these changes once they are in place. But the regulations disappointed nursing associations and many advocates by declining to set minimum staffing standards. And one key provision has already been stopped in its tracks by a lawsuit.A look at some particulars:■ The regulations strengthen residents’ control over certain decisions important to their daily lives. For example, the rules allow people to receive any visitor they choose (not just relatives) whenever they choose, without restricted hours, as long as visitors don’t disturb other residents.Just having family members around in the evening, when homes have fewer staff members, might improve attention and care, Dr. Castle pointed out.The requirements also allow residents to choose their roommates when both parties agree, making it easier for friends, siblings or same-sex couples to share living quarters. And they require facilities to make meals and snacks available when residents want to eat, not only at predetermined mealtimes.“Over all, we are really pleased with the focus on person-centered care, trying to transform the nursing home environment,” Dr. Phillips said.■ For the first time, nursing homes must take “reasonable care” of residents’ personal belongings and can’t shrug off responsibility for theft or loss by requiring residents to sign waivers. “That’s been a big complaint,” Ms. Grant said.Moving into a nursing home already requires giving up so many possessions that “losing something can be devastating” — especially when eyeglasses, hearing aids or dentures go missing.■ The regulations call for expanded staff training in preventing elder abuse and in caring for patients with dementia. Dr. Phillips calls the latter critically important; most residents have moderate or severe dementia, Medicare statistics show. The rule also requires a nursing home to designate an infection-control officer and to establish a system to monitor antibiotic use.■ Long-term-care ombudsmen report frequent complaints of “dumping”: A nursing home sends a resident, often someone whose dementia causes problematic behavior, to a hospital. Then, after she is discharged, the home won’t readmit her. “Once they’re out the door, it’s a lot easier to just evict someone,” Ms. Grant said.The existing regulations provide a lot of protection against being bounced from nursing homes; the new rule extends those protections to someone who’s been hospitalized but intends to return. “That resident has all the rights that go with discharge and can appeal the decision.” Nor can the facility transfer the resident while she is appealing. The rule toughens other kinds of grievance procedures as well.But one major change, a ban on the binding arbitration agreements that nursing homes frequently require at admission — before any dispute arises — has already stalled.The American Health Care Association, which represents most for-profit nursing homes — 70 percent of nursing homes in the United States are for-profit — filed suit to stop the change. In November, a federal court in Mississippi granted a preliminary injunction.Giving residents and families the right to take nursing homes to court could bring far-reaching results, Ms. Grant said. Arbitration proceedings typically remain confidential, and monetary awards can be modest.“It’s all behind closed doors,” she said. “When you have a public lawsuit, that’s an amount of money that gets attention from owners and operators and serves as a deterrent” to substandard care.Medicare has appealed, but a final court disposition could be months or years away. “This may be one area where C.M.S. says, ‘We tried it and it didn’t work,’” Dr. Phillips said. LeadingAge takes the position that arbitration should be optional but not outlawed.The government also declined to incorporate specific staff ratios or minimum hours of care in the new regulations, or to require nursing homes to have registered nurses on site around the clock. (Current rules require R.N.s only for eight hours.)Instead, homes must develop assessments of their resources and residents’ needs and hire accordingly. Federal regulators feared that some homes, particularly in rural areas, might find higher staff requirements unnecessary and impossible to reach, and close down rather than face violations and fines.Advocates are fuming, however, because better staffing has been shown to improve quality of care. Without standards, “it’s completely left to the nursing homes, and they’re not going to change because there’s no incentive to,” said Charlene Harrington, a longtime nursing home researcher at the University of California, San Francisco.“They can cut staff, keep their wages low and pocket the profits,” she said.As with any regulation, much depends on implementation and enforcement. Medicare will not issue guidance — the details on exactly how nursing homes must comply — until summer.And some obvious upgrades lie beyond the scope of such rules, Dr. Castle pointed out. Paying nursing aides more helps to reduce staff turnover, he said, as does “consistent assignment” — having aides care for and develop relationships with the same patients each day.“If you really want to improve nursing homes, you should pay more for Medicaid,” Dr. Castle added. The federal and state program underwrites most long-stay nursing home care, and it is chronically underfunded. “What do you do with $98 a day to care for a resident?”But Washington doesn’t seem to be in a let’s-pay-more mood. In fact, “we’re wondering and worrying whether these new regulations will be repealed” by the Republican Congress, Ms. Grant said.For now, though, they are the law. Families and residents who want to know more can wade through hundreds of pages in the Federal Register (I don’t recommend it) or turn to summaries compiled by consumer groups.Better yet, they can contact local or state long-term-care ombudsmen to learn how the changes apply to them.

"Gazing Into Danakil Depression’s Mirror, and Seeing Mars Stare Back","DANAKIL DEPRESSION, Ethiopia — In oppressively dry heat and a miasma of sulfur and chlorine, the rocky landscape sprouts patches of neon green and yellow that resemble oozing scrambled eggs.Near-boiling pools of acidic water bubble between odd formations of rocks and minerals: white beehive-shaped mounds of salt, yolk-colored lattices of sulfuric crust, purplish-red crumbles. Nearby, iron-rich rock fans out into flat mushroom shapes. The ground crackles hollowly underfoot and emits the hiss of bubbling liquid. Cones and small mineral chimneys babble from one-holed spouts in alien whispers.Though it looks like an extraterrestrial scene, this landscape belongs to the Danakil Depression, in a remote northeast region of Ethiopia aptly named Afar, near Eritrea.About 100 meters below sea level, the Danakil Depression is one of the world’s lowest places. It is also one of the hottest places on Earth, with average daily temperatures of 34.4 degrees Celsius (93.9 degrees Fahrenheit) and only about 100 millimeters of rain each year.This volcanic region is known as a geological wonder. Indeed, most of the relatively scant scientific research on the Danakil Depression involves its fantastical geology, not its biology. Now, scientists are studying this area to understand the possibilities of life on other planets and moons, despite the region’s political volatility and sporadic violence between Ethiopia and Eritrea. This month, a team of astrobiologists from Europlanet, a consortium of research institutions and companies doing planetary research, returned to study the depression’s geology, mineralogy and especially its biology, as an analogue to Mars.Felipe Gómez Gómez of the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid led the team’s first expedition last spring to study Danakil’s extremophiles, microbes that live in extreme conditions. Researchers from Madrid and the University of Bologna and the International Research School of Planetary Sciences, both in Italy, assisted by scientists from the University of Mekelle in Ethiopia, are isolating and identifying the hardy bacteria that thrive in this hostile environment of heat, acidity and salinity.The aim is “to try to know the limits of life and the possibility of such forms of life in other planets like Mars,” said Dr. Gómez, who is part of the science team of Curiosity, the NASA exploration rover that landed on Mars over four years ago.He has also studied other extremophiles, such as microbes that thrive in the acidic iron-rich Río Tinto in southwestern Spain. For that research, he and his colleagues exposed an acidophile to simulated Mars conditions, described in a 2010 paper in the journal Icarus.Knowledge from Danakil could be applied to Mars missions. Studying Danakil’s microbes is “a way to train ourselves to identify different forms of life for astrobiological exploration,” Dr. Gómez said. While Mars today has subfreezing temperatures, its origins are volcanic and might be similar to the early history of Earth.There is also a broader goal of exploring ways to identify signs of life in extreme environments. “What is life? What are the limits of life? Scientists don’t agree on what is life,” Dr. Gómez said. “If we find life on Mars, would we be able to recognize it? We don’t know.”The Danakil Depression, a rift valley stretching from the Dallol volcano in Ethiopia to the salt plains of Lake Assal in Djibouti, lies at the convergence of three tectonic plates that are slowly separating. As the earth pulls apart and thins over millenniums, the land sinks.Thousands of years ago, the larger Danakil Desert was part of the Red Sea. But volcanic eruptions formed rock barriers and created an inland sea that eventually evaporated in the intense heat. Vast salt flats and salt lakes remain and are still mined by the nomadic Afar tribes, who transport salt slabs from Danakil by camel caravan.Dallol, which means disintegration in the Afar language, is the section that is home to colorful, otherworldly formations. Here, magma heats groundwater, which wells up and dissolves salt, potash and other minerals when emerging through hot springs. Brine evaporates, leaving crusty formations colored by minerals, iron and salt-thriving halophile algae to create this multicolored scenery.Some pools of water reach 90 degrees Celsius. The combination of heat, high acidity and sulfur concentrations causes bright yellow chimneys to form. Other pools of water heated to 40 degrees Celsius take on a turquoise hue from copper salts.Europlanet researchers last year took water samples from salt chimneys, blue and red pools, and yellow and brown crust. Although halophiles — microbes that thrive in saline conditions — have been identified in Dallol, this new research is the first to focus on microbes thriving in extreme acidity and heat, in addition to salinity, Dr. Gómez said.Researchers are isolating bacteria and their DNA and also doing genetic sequencing to identify the bacteria. Among them are chemolithotrophs — micro-organisms that acquire energy from inorganic compounds — that were found in the hot water on the mineral chimneys. These microbes do not require sunlight for energy and are usually found in extreme environments like hydrothermal vents on the seafloor.These simple organisms can survive with a “very small battery,” and were probably among the first bacteria on Earth, Dr. Gómez said. “That is what makes them so interesting from an astrobiological point of view.”Chemolithotrophs can use inorganic reduced compounds — like sulfide, elemental sulfur, hydrogen and ammonia — as energy sources, and can grow without organic compounds and light. Scientists believe this kind of metabolism happens only with prokaryotes, microbes without a nucleus.Sulfur is abundant in Dallol because the area was covered by the sea ages ago. Here, sulfur vapor steams from chimneys on the ground. In dark submarine depths, sulfur can be the main energy source for certain bacteria living far from sunlight. In Dallol, these sources of sulfur are within arm’s reach on the Earth’s surface.Scientists are still studying their first samples from Danakil, but “we know there is life,” Dr. Gomez said.This winter’s expedition will focus on bacteria’s relationship with the atmosphere. Researchers will set up weather stations to record wind, temperature, humidity and more, “to study the environment completely, like what Curiosity does on Mars,” Dr. Gómez said. In this case, though, scientists will not have to leave Earth to do so."
The Right Way to Say ‘I’m Sorry’,"Most people say “I’m sorry” many times a day for a host of trivial affronts – accidentally bumping into someone or failing to hold open a door. These apologies are easy and usually readily accepted, often with a response like, “No problem.”But when “I’m sorry” are the words needed to right truly hurtful words, acts or inaction, they can be the hardest ones to utter. And even when an apology is offered with the best of intentions, it can be seriously undermined by the way in which it is worded. Instead of eradicating the emotional pain the affront caused, a poorly worded apology can result in lasting anger and antagonism, and undermine an important relationship.I admit to a lifetime of challenges when it comes to apologizing, especially when I thought I was right or misunderstood or that the offended party was being overly sensitive. But I recently discovered that the need for an apology is less about me than the person who, for whatever reason, is offended by something I said or did or failed to do, regardless of my intentions.I also learned that a sincere apology can be powerful medicine with surprising value for the giver as well as the recipient.After learning that a neighbor who had assaulted me verbally was furious about an oversight I had not known I committed, I wrote a letter in hopes of defusing the hostility. Without offering any excuses, I apologized for my lapse in etiquette and respect. I said I was not asking for or expecting forgiveness, merely that I hoped we could have a civil, if not friendly, relationship going forward, then delivered the letter with a jar of my homemade jam.Expecting nothing in return, I was greatly relieved when my doorbell rang and the neighbor thanked me warmly for what I had said and done. My relief was palpable. I felt as if I’d not only discarded an enemy but made a new friend, which is indeed how it played out in the days that followed.About a week later I learned that, according to the psychologist and author Harriet Lerner, the wording of my apology was just what the “doctor” would have ordered. In the very first chapter of her new book, “Why Won’t You Apologize?,” Dr. Lerner points out that apologies followed by rationalizations are “never satisfying” and can even be harmful.“When ‘but’ is tagged on to an apology,” she wrote, it’s an excuse that counters the sincerity of the original message. The best apologies are short and don’t include explanations that can undo them.Nor should a request for forgiveness be part of an apology. The offended party may accept a sincere apology but still be unready to forgive the transgression. Forgiveness, should it come, may depend on a demonstration going forward that the offense will not be repeated.“It’s not our place to tell anyone to forgive or not to forgive,” Dr. Lerner said in an interview. She disputes popular thinking that failing to forgive is bad for one’s health and can lead to a life mired in bitterness and hate.“There is no one path to healing,” she said. “There are many roads to letting go of corrosive emotions without forgiving, like therapy, meditation, medication, even swimming.”Hardest of all, Dr. Lerner said, is to forgive a nonapologetic offender, like my aunt whom I had loved dearly and who served as my second mother after mine died. But when I, raised Jewish, married a Christian, she refused to come to the wedding and never apologized for the intense hurt her absence had caused. Although I made several attempts to restore the relationship, she always managed to deflect them, and to this day, more than half a century later, I cannot forgive her.The focus of an apology should be on what the offender has said or done, not on the person’s reaction to it. Saying “I’m sorry you feel that way” shifts the focus away from the person who is supposedly apologizing and turns “I’m sorry” into “I’m not really sorry at all,” the psychologist wrote.As to why many people find it hard to offer a sincere, unfettered apology, Dr. Lerner pointed out that “humans are hard-wired for defensiveness. It’s very difficult to take direct, unequivocal responsibility for our hurtful actions. It takes a great deal of maturity to put a relationship or another person before our need to be right.”Offering an apology is an admission of guilt that admittedly leaves people vulnerable. There’s no guarantee as to how it will be received. It is the prerogative of the injured party to reject an apology, even when sincerely offered. The person may feel the offense was so enormous — for example, having been sexually abused by a parent — that it is impossible to accept a mea culpa offered by the abusive parent years later.Righting a perceived wrong can be especially challenging when it involves family members, who may be inclined to cite history — he was abused by his father, or she was raised by a distant mother — as an excuse for hurtful behavior. “History can be used as an explanation, not an excuse,” the psychologist said. “It should involve a conversation that allows the hurt party to express anger and pain if an apology, however sincere, is to heal a broken connection.”As she wrote: “Nondefensive listening [to the hurt party] is at the heart of offering a sincere apology.” She urges the listener not to “interrupt, argue, refute, or correct facts, or bring up your own criticisms and complaints.” Even when the offended party is largely at fault, she suggests apologizing for one’s own part in the incident, however small it may be.Dr. Lerner views apology as “central to health, both physical and emotional. ‘I’m sorry’ are the two most healing words in the English language,” she said. “The courage to apologize wisely and well is not just a gift to the injured person, who can then feel soothed and released from obsessive recriminations, bitterness and corrosive anger. It’s also a gift to one’s own health, bestowing self-respect, integrity and maturity — an ability to take a cleareyed look at how our behavior affects others and to assume responsibility for acting at another person’s expense.”Beverly Engel, the author of “The Power of Apology,” relates how her life was changed by a sincere, effective apology from her mother for years of emotional abuse. “Almost like magic,” she wrote, “apology has the power to repair harm, mend relationships, soothe wounds and heal broken hearts. An apology actually affects the bodily functions of the person receiving it — blood pressure decreases, heart rate slows and breathing becomes steadier.”"
How to Do the Shortest Workout Possible,"Super-short workouts are a favorite topic in this column. I have written about seven-minute, six-minute, four-minute, and even one-minute workouts. They are appealing because they require so little time, but they also demand straining effort.Martin Gibala is the scientist we most have to thank for the popularity of very brief, very hard exercise. All of these workouts are built around the concept of high-intensity interval training, in which you push yourself almost to exhaustion for a brief spurt of minutes or seconds, and then rest and recover for a few minutes before repeating the intense interval.Athletes have long used interval sessions as part of a varied weekly training program to improve their competitiveness. But Dr. Gibala, a professor of kinesiology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, has helped to popularize the idea that we can rely on high-intensity intervals as our only exercise, and do very, very few of them while still improving our health and fitness.Since 2004, he has published multiple studies about the potent effects of intervals. Perhaps the most important and illustrative was a 2014 experiment that I wrote about at the time. For it, he and his colleagues asked sedentary men and women to complete three 20-second intervals on a stationary bicycle, pedaling as hard as they could manage, with two minutes of gentle, slow pedaling between each interval. This was the one-minute workout.After six weeks of performing three of these sessions per week, for a total of 18 minutes of intense exercise tucked in to slightly longer periods of less intense exercise, the volunteers were significantly more aerobically fit and healthier, with improved blood pressure numbers and markers of muscular health.Because of Dr. Gibala’s studies, I do some type of interval training most weeks now. I no longer have the excuse of skipping workouts because I’m too busy. Now Dr. Gibala has written a new book, “The One-Minute Workout” (co-authored with Christopher Shulgan), which will be published on Tuesday. It details his research and provides a number of different, high-intensity interval training workouts, in addition to the one-minute version.After reading the book (for which I provided an early reader’s review but had no other involvement), I spoke with Dr. Gibala by phone from his office at McMaster University about what science does and does not yet understand about this type of exercise and about how he works out. Here are edited excerpts from our conversation.Q. Whenever I write about H.I.I.T., people ask me whether intense interval training is actually better for you than more-traditional longer, slower types of workouts. Is it?A. “Better” is a loaded word. I don’t think we have proven that one type of exercise is substantially better for you than another, from a physiological standpoint. Both improve health and fitness. But one is far more time efficient. So if the obstacle keeping someone from exercise is time, then H.I.I.T. is the preferred exercise option. I think almost everyone can find a few minutes in their day for a short interval workout.But most of the studies you describe in your book involve stationary bicycling, which usually means a gym membership that not everyone has. Can other types of activity be adapted for H.I.I.T.?Absolutely. That’s one of the great things about interval training. It only requires that for a brief period of time, you push yourself out of your comfort zone. You don’t have to reach any set percentage of heart rate or anything like that. You just need to feel some brief discomfort. You can achieve that by running hard to the next signpost when you are out on a trail or picking up the pace while you are walking. In the book, we describe how different types of exercise can be used for H.I.I.T. We have even shown that you can complete a very effective H.I.I.T. program in a stairwell during your lunch break.Another question I often hear is about weight loss. Since the sessions are so short, does H.I.I.T. burn many calories?In general, exercise is not a huge contributor to weight control. People don’t like to hear that, but it’s true. It is much easier to cut calories in the diet than to burn large numbers of them with exercise of any kind. With H.I.I.T., there is some evidence that you develop a slight metabolic after-burn, meaning that for up to 24 hours after a session, you burn slightly more calories than if you had not exercised. But the numbers are small, so it’s better to eat less if weight loss is a goal.Is one minute the shortest possible H.I.I.T. workout or will I be writing about a 30-second workout soon?I think one minute may be the limit. We are still looking for the exact sweet spot in terms of how little intense effort people can do and still get significant health and fitness benefits. So far, it looks as if three repetitions of 20-second intervals is the lowest effective load. But we are still experimenting. Stay tuned.What is your exercise routine?I do something physical every day, and it’s not all H.I.I.T. I play a weekly hockey game. But life is busy. My wife works and we have young kids. So most of the time, it’s intervals, sometimes on a stationary bike, sometimes on other equipment in my basement. I do high-speed pull-ups and push-ups. I’m like everyone else. I fit in as much exercise as I can, when I can, and that would be my advice to anyone."
‘Listen to Evidence’: March for Science Plans Washington Rally on Earth Day,"Within a week of its creation, the March for Science campaign had attracted more than 1.3 million supporters across Facebook and Twitter, cementing itself as a voice for people who are concerned about the future of science under President Trump.Now, hoping to transform that viral success into something approaching the significance of the women’s march last month, the campaign has scheduled its demonstration in Washington for Earth Day, April 22.“Yes, this is a protest, but it’s not a political protest,” said Jonathan Berman, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and a lead organizer of the march. “The people making decisions are in Washington, and they are the people we are trying to reach with the message: You should listen to evidence.”Last week, Dr. Berman found himself in the middle of a social media movement. While browsing a Reddit discussion about how the new administration was handling science, he came across a comment that he interpreted as a call to arms: “There needs to be a Scientists’ March on Washington.”“I thought someone should do that,” Dr. Berman said, “and I realized, I’m someone.”He proceeded to buy a web domain, design a logo and create a Twitter account for what was then called “The Scientists’ March on Washington.” Within three days, the idea had more than 700,000 supporters across its social media platforms.Other collaborators quickly joined Dr. Berman’s efforts. Dr. Caroline Weinberg, a public health researcher and science writer in New York, was concerned by news reports about science at the Environmental Protection Agency. Inspired by the women’s march and excited by the idea of scientists holding their own, she connected with Dr. Berman. They decided to organize a steering committee and draft a mission statement and diversity statement, but their efforts could hardly keep up with the thousands of volunteer requests and social media responses.“While it was overwhelming, it was incredibly heartwarming that so many people were concerned with what’s going on with science and this administration,” Dr. Weinberg said. “People were willing to donate their time and energy to this. They were just waiting for someone to set up a Twitter handle.”As the organizers address the logistical challenges of enlisting thousands of people to march on the National Mall, what they have proposed has received support from some leaders in the scientific community.“I think it’s terrific to have people standing up for science,” said Rush D. Holt Jr., the chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which has more than 120,000 members.His sentiments were echoed by Christine McEntee, the chief executive of the American Geophysical Union, which has more than 60,000 members.“This is showing that there is a large community of scientists and individuals who are supportive of science and are quite concerned about what they are hearing from this incoming administration and Congress,” she said, “and they want to raise their voice.”But the organizers of the march also face critical views.“I think the average American will scratch their head and say: ‘What are they marching for? What is the threat?’” said William Happer, a physicist from Princeton University who met with Mr. Trump before his inauguration and who has been cited as a potential science adviser to the administration. Dr. Happer added that scientists could risk losing some of their public support with a large-scale protest.“It’s quite possible that this kind of public exercise could actually be bad for science — it’s like the toddler banging his spoon in the highchair,” he said. “It may not turn out to garner a lot of sympathy.”In the months ahead, the organizers of the march will have to contend with these and other views among scientists worrying about politicizing scientific inquiry. But Dr. Weinberg, one of the lead organizers, said she thought the public believed differently based on the response she has seen online.“The overall tone of the current government seems to be trending in an anti-science direction,” she said. “That is why so many people were motivated to do something like march for science.”"
Hormone Blockers Can Prolong Life if Prostate Cancer Recurs,"Men whose prostate cancer comes back after surgery are more likely to survive if, along with the usual radiation, they also take drugs to block male hormones.The finding, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, comes from a long-running study that experts say will help clarify treatment for many patients.After surgery to remove the prostate, more than 30 percent of men have a recurrence, and until now there has not been clear evidence about the best way to stop the disease from killing them. Most are given radiation, but prescribing drugs to counter the effects of male hormones has been inconsistent.The study, paid for by the National Cancer Institute, showed that among men who received radiation and hormonal treatment, 76.3 percent were still alive after 12 years, compared to 71.3 percent who had radiation alone.At 12 years, the men who had both treatments were also much less likely to have died from their prostate cancer — 5.8 percent versus 13.4 percent — or to have the cancer spread around their bodies — 14.5 percent versus 23 percent.“This is a big deal,” said Dr. Ian M. Thompson Jr., of the Christus Santa Rosa Health System in San Antonio, who was not part of the study but wrote an editorial accompanying it.“There are so many things we do in prostate cancer that we don’t know if they make a big difference in survival. This is one of the things where now we can say for sure.”He added that he hoped the findings would change medical practice.The medical term for blocking male hormones is chemical castration, and the treatments can cause hot flashes, sexual problems and other side effects. So to put a man through it, said Dr. Anthony L. Zietman, an author of the study, “you’d better have some decent justification.”Dr. David F. Penson, the chairman of urologic surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the study “gives more credence to the concept that you have to treat the whole patient,” rather than just irradiating the area where the cancer used to be.He said the idea of blocking hormones in men like those in the study was finding its way into medical practice.About 161,360 new cases of prostate cancer and 26,730 deaths are expected in the United States in 2017, according to the American Cancer Society.The average age at diagnosis is 66. Globally, there were 1.1 million cases and 307,000 deaths in 2012, the most recent data available from the World Health Organization.The study, begun in 1998 and led by Dr. William U. Shipley, a radiation oncologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, had an ambitious goal: to follow the patients long enough to find out whether hormone-blocking treatment would affect their survival.Prostate cancer grows slowly, so it took well over a decade for answers to emerge. Researchers and patients from 150 sites in North America participated. The patients were 760 men who had their prostates removed for cancer that had not spread, but who then had a sign of recurrence — a rise in their blood levels of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, a protein associated with prostate cancer. The men in the study had PSAs of 0.2 to 4 nanograms per milliliter.“That’s just like the first wisp of smoke,” said Dr. Zietman, who is a professor of radiation oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. “There’ll be fire someday.”The fire might take five, 10 or 15 years to break out, but Dr. Zietman said, “Many are in their 50s or 60s, and will live long enough to get into trouble.”The traditional practice for a rising PSA after surgery has been to give radiation, which targets only the pelvis.The idea of the study was to add hormonal treatment, which might stop minute clumps of cancer that had spread to other parts of the body.All the men in the study had radiation for six and a half weeks. For two years, half also received a hormone-blocking drug, bicalutamide, and the other half were given placebos. They were followed, on average, for about 13 years.“This is the first trial that’s shown, if you follow these patients long enough, there is a real difference,” Dr. Zietman said. “More people survive 15 years later.”Men who had more aggressive cancers — reflected by higher PSA readings after surgery and by the pathology and surgical reports on their tumors — had the most to gain from the hormone-blocking treatment.The results do not mean that every man with a rising PSA after surgery should have hormone treatment, Dr. Zietman said. Men 75 or older may not need it, because they may die from other causes before the cancer can catch up with them.“But if they’re younger and with a longer life expectancy, treatment is reasonable,” he said.Bicalutamide causes men to develop breasts and potentially other problems, and the high dose given in the study is no longer used in the United States.Other hormone-blocking drugs like Lupron have mostly taken its place, and may be even more effective, Dr. Zietman said. The study proved the concept that hormone blocking increases survival, he added, so other drugs that do the same thing should also help patients live longer.Another study in progress in Canada and Europe uses the newer drugs, and is trying to determine whether taking them for six months, rather than two years, might be enough."
Open Wide: Deep-Sea Fishes That Are Built to Eat Big,"We’re about 600 to 3,000 feet below the ocean’s surface. It’s cold, it’s dark and it’s slow down here. If you’re lucky, it’s blue in the daytime and black at night. And the deeper we go, the darker it gets.Welcome to the twilight zone, fishies.There’s not much to eat and no green plants growing either. Here, you eat what you can get, and find a way to eat it, or you starve.It’s weird down here, in the mesopelagic zone of the deep sea. Creatures can be sluggish, but they are well adapted. Some use big eyes to find prey. Others make their own flashlights. Big mouths help predators eat big prey. That may be why barbeled dragonfishes have special head joints that allow them to open up their mouths 120 degrees and swallow big prey whole. This flexible head joint, described for the first time in a study published on Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, is unlike any other known to science.Nalani Schnell, a zoologist at the French National Museum of Natural History, had already discovered that different groups of barbeled dragonfishes had an unusual gap between their heads and necks that other fishes don’t have. Some gaps were the result of a missing first vertebrae. Others resulted from the absence of a spine, filled in instead with an elongated notochord, a flexible rod made up of something similar to cartilage.To find out the function of these gaps, Dr. Schnell teamed up with Dave Johnson, a zoologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Together, they obtained five divergent groups of the species from museum collections, macerated the flesh from their bodies and stained the bones different colors. This allowed them to actually move the bones around, which led to the discovery that the gap was a functional joint that allows the fish’s head to move up and out.“In most other fishes, the head has a strong connection to the rest of the body, without much flexibility,” Dr. Schnell wrote in an email, which is a stabilizing force during swimming. But “the barbeled dragonfishes are sit-and-wait (ambush) predators, and prey items are scarce in the deep-sea.”As the species diverged into different groups, the flexible gaps in the more primitive fish developed into “an actual folding apparatus that makes this a true joint,” Dr. Johnson said. “There are no other fishes that have that sort of a directional, complex articulation.”A joint that allows them to open their mouths wide is advantageous because they can engulf large prey that can sustain them for long periods of no food. Like the moray eel, barbeled dragonfishes use a second set of teeth to pull the large prey into their bodies to digest it.“Imagine yourself out in the middle of the ocean, and you’re trying to make a living. You’re going to eat anything you can, if you think it isn’t going to kill you,” Dr. Johnson said. “You don’t bypass this thing because it’s too big to eat, because you don’t know when you’re going to see another meal.”"
"The Purpose of Sleep? To Forget, Scientists Say","Over the years, scientists have come up with a lot of ideas about why we sleep.Some have argued that it’s a way to save energy. Others have suggested that slumber provides an opportunity to clear away the brain’s cellular waste. Still others have proposed that sleep simply forces animals to lie still, letting them hide from predators.A pair of papers published on Thursday in the journal Science offer evidence for another notion: We sleep to forget some of the things we learn each day.In order to learn, we have to grow connections, or synapses, between the neurons in our brains. These connections enable neurons to send signals to one another quickly and efficiently. We store new memories in these networks.In 2003, Giulio Tononi and Chiara Cirelli, biologists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, proposed that synapses grew so exuberantly during the day that our brain circuits got “noisy.” When we sleep, the scientists argued, our brains pare back the connections to lift the signal over the noise.In the years since, Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli, along with other researchers, have found a great deal of indirect evidence to support the so-called synaptic homeostasis hypothesis.It turns out, for example, that neurons can prune their synapses — at least in a dish. In laboratory experiments on clumps of neurons, scientists can give them a drug that spurs them to grow extra synapses. Afterward, the neurons pare back some of the growth.Other evidence comes from the electric waves released by the brain. During deep sleep, the waves slow down. Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli have argued that shrinking synapses produce this change.Four years ago, Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli got a chance to test their theory by looking at the synapses themselves. They acquired a kind of deli slicer for brain tissue, which they used to shave ultrathin sheets from a mouse’s brain.Luisa de Vivo, an assistant scientist working in their lab, led a painstaking survey of tissue taken from mice, some awake and others asleep. She and her colleagues determined the size and shape of 6,920 synapses in total.The synapses in the brains of sleeping mice, they found, were 18 percent smaller than in awake ones. “That there’s such a big change over all is surprising,” Dr. Tononi said.The second study  was led by Graham H. Diering, a postdoctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Diering and his colleagues set out to explore the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis by studying the proteins in mouse brains. “I’m really coming at it from this nuts-and-bolts place,” Dr. Diering said.In one experiment, Dr. Diering and his colleagues created a tiny window through which they could peer into mouse brains. Then he and his colleagues added a chemical that lit up a surface protein on brain synapses.Looking through the window, they found that the number of surface proteins dropped during sleep. That decline is what you would expect if the synapses were shrinking.Dr. Diering and his colleagues then searched for the molecular trigger for this change. They found that hundreds of proteins increase or decrease inside of synapses during the night. But one protein in particular, called Homer1A, stood out.In earlier experiments on neurons in a dish, Homer1A proved to be important for paring back synapses. Dr. Diering wondered if it was important in sleep, too.To find out, he and his colleagues studied mice genetically engineered so that they couldn’t make Homer1A proteins. These mice slept like ordinary mice, but their synapses didn’t change their proteins like the ones in ordinary mice.Dr. Diering’s research suggests that sleepiness triggers neurons to make Homer1A and ship it into their synapses. When sleep arrives, Homer1A turns on the pruning machinery.To see how this pruning machinery affects learning, the scientists gave regular mice a memory test. They put the animals in a room where they got a mild electric shock if they walked over one section of the floor.That night, the scientists injected a chemical into the brains of some of the mice. The chemical had been shown to block neurons in dishes from pruning their synapses.The next day, the scientists put all the mice back in the chamber they had been in before. Both groups of mice spent much of the time frozen, fearfully recalling the shock.But when the researchers put the mice in a different chamber, they saw a big difference. The ordinary mice sniffed around curiously. The mice that had been prevented from pruning their brain synapses during sleep, on the other hand, froze once again.Dr. Diering thinks that the injected mice couldn’t narrow their memories down to the particular chamber where they had gotten the shock. Without nighttime pruning, their memories ended up fuzzy.In their own experiment, Dr. Tononi and his colleagues found that the pruning didn’t strike every neuron. A fifth of the synapses were unchanged. It’s possible that these synapses encode well-established memories that shouldn’t be tampered with.“You can forget in a smart way,” Dr. Tononi said.Other researchers cautioned that the new findings weren’t definitive proof of the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis.Marcos G. Frank, a sleep researcher at Washington State University in Spokane, said that it could be hard to tell whether changes to the brain at night were caused by sleep or by the biological clock. “It’s a general problem in the field,” he said.Markus H. Schmidt, of the Ohio Sleep Medicine Institute, said that while the brain might prune synapses during sleep, he questioned whether this was the main explanation for why sleep exists.“The work is great,” he said of the new studies, “but the question is, is this a function of sleep or is it the function?”Many organs, not just the brain, seem to function differently during sleep, Dr. Schmidt pointed out. The gut appears to make many new cells, for example.Dr. Tononi said that the new findings should prompt a look at what current sleeping drugs do in the brain. While they may be good at making people sleepy, it’s also possible that they may interfere with the pruning required for forming memories.“You may actually work against yourself,” Dr. Tononi said.In the future, sleep medicines might precisely target the molecules involved in sleep, ensuring that synapses get properly pruned.“Once you know a little bit of what happens at the ground-truth level, you can get a better idea of what to do for therapy,” Dr. Tononi said."
Soccer Ball Heading May Cause Concussion Symptoms,"Soccer players who frequently head the ball may be increasing their risk for concussion, a new study reports.The study, published Wednesday in Neurology, included 222 amateur soccer players — 175 men and 47 women — who reported the number of times they headed the ball over a two-week period. The athletes also reported any unintentional head impacts, such as collisions with other players or the goal post.Over the two-week period, men had head contact with the ball an average of 44 times, while women headed the ball an average of 27 times. Overall, players reported heading the ball an average of 5.3 times a game. Players who headed the ball the most (those in the top quartile of heading reports) were three times as likely to have concussion symptoms, such as pain, dizziness and feeling dazed, compared to those players in the lowest quartile.Collisions with another player or the goal post were far more risky. Those with two or more unintentional head collisions were six times as likely to have concussion symptoms as those who reported a single impact. In 470 reports of head impacts, a fifth resulted in moderate or severe symptoms of concussion.An accompanying editorial noted that the study focused on adult players, and the results can’t be generalized to teenagers and children. However, they noted that the study group reported three practices and two games in two weeks, a schedule that would be comparable to that of both adults and children playing in amateur leagues.The lead author, Dr. Michael L. Lipton, a professor of radiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, said the finding is just the beginning of an effort to understand the long-term implications of heading the ball, and whether all forms of heading carry similar risks. He said the data don’t yet support a ban on the practice.“We don’t know how much is too much. It would be great to say ‘no heading,’ but we don’t have enough information to say that. Public health interventions have to be based on evidence.”"
Republicans Try a New Tack on Climate Change,"Not long ago, many Republican officeholders had a simple answer when asked about the changing climate: What changing climate?But the public began to notice the heat waves and the torrential rains and the tidal flooding. So then we had the “I am not a scientist” phase, with one lawmaker after another fending off climate questions with that formula.That drew such ridicule that Republicans critical of climate science had to come up with a more nuanced answer. Several variations on the new approach were on display recently during confirmation hearings for some of President Trump’s cabinet nominees.“Science tells us that the climate is changing and human activity in some manner impacts that change,” Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general nominated to run the Environmental Protection Agency, told a Senate committee. “The human ability to measure with precision the extent of that impact is subject to continuing debate and dialogue, as well they should be.”Let us ponder the craftsmanship of that second sentence.“With precision” is the key phrase, of course, and it renders the statement almost axiomatically true. Do we have trouble taking the precise temperature of an entire planet and then divining, for a given period, exactly how much of the change in that temperature is caused by human activities?Well, yes.Anybody who did not know better might come away thinking there is room to doubt whether humans are the main cause of global warming. Mr. Pruitt did not actually say that, of course — nowadays, hard-core climate denial provokes a furious response from Democrats in Congress and mild protest even from a few Republicans.Thus Mr. Pruitt and the other Trump nominees labored to avoid overt denial while signaling to their allies that there is enough doubt to justify inaction on emissions or even rolling back steps the Obama administration took.“They’re just trying not to look crazy, because if they look too crazy, then Susan Collins” — a Republican senator from Maine — “and a few of the moderate Republicans might jump ship,” said Raymond T. Pierrehumbert, an American climate scientist who holds a chair at Oxford University, in Britain.In interviews, Dr. Pierrehumbert and several other experts said the public should not be fooled. The deep consensus among climate scientists, arrived at through decades of research, is that human activity is the cause of most of the planetary warming of recent decades, and probably all of it.What is the evidence?For starters, an unassailable body of physics tells us that if you add carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, they will trap extra heat near the surface of the planet, a prediction so basic it was first made in the 19th century.“People have been trying, but nobody has really shaken the foundations of the theory in all that time,” Dr. Pierrehumbert said.Emissions have soared in the modern era, and as predicted, the Earth is heating up. That would be obvious just from all the land ice that is melting, but of course, we have had thermometers for centuries now. They show that the Earth has warmed roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century, a large number for the surface of a planet.With just those facts, you have a powerful circumstantial case that human activities are the cause of global warming. But we have more: Sophisticated computer analyses of the climate confirm it, finding that no factor other than the human release of greenhouse gases is large enough to explain the recent warming.What are the soft spots in the theory?The biggest is that natural factors could in principle be causing the climate to change, as Mr. Pruitt implied. Suppose, for example, that the sun were to start putting out a lot more radiation; that would definitely warm the Earth.But we have satellites keeping a close eye on the sun, and it has not changed nearly enough to be the culprit. Scientists have looked closely at all the possible natural factors, in fact, and they are not adequate to explain the warming.“Of all the natural drivers, and everything we know that works on long time scales that has ever affected climate in the past, all those things have been ruled out,” said Drew Shindell, an atmospheric scientist at Duke University. “Beyond a reasonable doubt, it has to be human activities.”The most important uncertainties are not really about the cause of global warming — we are the cause — but in trying to forecast how big the coming changes will be.If emissions continue at a high level but the Earth turns out to be less sensitive to greenhouse gases than currently believed, that would give humanity a few extra decades to come to grips with the situation. But it is not a get-out-of-jail-free card: If we keep burning fossil fuels in that time, scientists say the planet will still undergo profound, threatening changes.On the other hand, if the Earth turns out to be especially sensitive to the gases and if we permit runaway emissions growth, some research suggests that huge parts of the world could eventually get so hot as to be uninhabitable by large mammals.Recall that the large mammals include human beings. “People tend to think of climate change as not being of the same magnitude as nuclear warfare, but at the high end, it’s arguably worse,” Dr. Pierrehumbert said.So, despite some genuine uncertainties, the risks are extraordinary, and the moral case for action is pretty clear: We have to get to zero emissions, the sooner the better. Mr. Trump’s nominees have so far displayed scant willingness to come to grips with that.Perhaps surprisingly, though, the congressional hearings did offer glimmers of hope.Rex W. Tillerson, who won confirmation on Wednesday as Mr. Trump’s secretary of state, implied that he might try to keep the nation committed to a big international deal on climate change reached in Paris in 2015.But the most interesting statements came from Rick Perry, Mr. Trump’s nominee to head the Department of Energy. Under questioning, Mr. Perry, the former Texas governor, was surprisingly positive about the role the federal government might play in developing advanced clean-energy technology.Many people — Bill Gates among them — see this as the most urgent issue. Renewable energy and greater use of natural gas are helping lower emissions in the short run, but if we do not invest heavily in research and development now, we may not have the technology we will eventually need to get to zero emissions.People like Mr. Gates and the entrepreneur Elon Musk are working on Mr. Trump. If the president’s mind is really open on global warming, as he said after the election, perhaps he could also sit down with a few of our brightest climate scientists.“If we always have to go back and debate the facts, we’re never going to get to the solutions,” said Ken Caldeira, a California climate expert who has helped to educate Mr. Gates. “Can’t we at least start with the facts and go from there?”"
"Streaming Lava, Collapsing Cliffs and a Hawaii Volcano’s Spectacular Show","Off the coast of the island of Hawaii, hundreds of millions of gallons of lava are flowing into the ocean like blood from a ruptured artery. Starting in January at Kīlauea Volcano’s Kamokuna ocean entry, the lava hit the salty water, shooting molten rock upward and outward, accompanied by a rising, steamy cloud of acid.Normally cooling lava would stack up, creating a rocky shelf on which the lava settles called a lava delta. But this time, the flow continued to gush nearly 100 feet down, into the sea, for a whole month.This same volcano has sent lava traveling through tubes from moving vents along its East Rift Zone known as Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō, ever since it erupted 34 years ago. And these tubes have carried it to a number of spots along the ocean. But streams like this usually only last a day or two. This one lasted from New Year’s Eve, when 21 acres of lava delta collapsed into the ocean, exposing the tube, until Thursday, when an unstable seacliff collapsed and finally cut off the picturesque stream.On Wednesday the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory noted that the sea cliff just near the entry was becoming increasingly unstable, and could collapse at any moment. By 6 p.m. E.T. Thursday, a crack in the seacliff split open and it fell into the sea. Lava is still flowing into the ocean, said Janet Babb, a geologist at the observatory, who monitors the volcano, in an email Thursday night. But she was uncertain that the fire hose flow was still visible.“As I like to say, the only constant on this volcano is change,” Ms. Babb said.Photos and videos of this spectacular lava flow into the ocean spread on social media this week. Flowing from Kilauea at a rate of about one or two cubic meters a second, somewhere between 788 million gallons and 1.576 billion gallons of lava flowed from Kilauea Volcano into the ocean during the firehose’s monthlong show.Why did this lava fire hose last so long?“The only thing we can surmise is the offshore topography apparently is so steep that, as the lava is flowing in and forming all this new rubble, it’s just slipping down into deeper parts of the ocean and not piling up to form a new delta,” Ms. Babb said ahead of the cliff collapse on Thursday. “Lava will continue to flow into the ocean until it’s disrupted.”The geological events that led up to the fire hose started long before the new year.In May 2016, a new vent broke out on Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō. Lava started flowing and moving south toward the coast. As the lava moved, the part touching the air cooled and crusted over, resulting in lava tubes that made its passage to the ocean far more efficient, as veins channel blood. The tubes from this volcano range in diameter: from so fat that a bus could pass through to so skinny that a human couldn’t.The lava traveled seven miles down these tubes, and by July 26, 2016, the lava had reached the ocean. At the time, that was big news, said Ms. Babb, because that was the first ocean entry since 2013.When hot lava hits salty water it results in a chemical explosion. Rubble forms, stacks up, and lava mounds up over it creating a lava delta. Over four months between July and December, this lava built a 24-acre delta.“Lava deltas are inherently unstable because they’re built on a foundation of rubble,” said Ms. Babb. They noticed cracks developing in the delta.“On New Year’s Eve the inevitable happened. The lava delta collapsed,” she said. Four acres of seacliff beside the delta and near an area that can get thousands of daily visitors also crumbled into the ocean below.When park rangers saw what was happening, they moved the viewing area farther away and actually had to turn people back who had ventured into the closed area minutes before the collapse.“The greatest feeling was a gratitude that no one was injured or killed during the collapse,” said Ms. Babb.The fire hose of lava was beautiful, and dangerous. When the 2,100 degree Fahrenheit lava hits 70 degree salt water, it results in an explosive reaction that sends rock, glass and fragments of molten lava called spatter onto the land and out to the sea, where it endangers wildlife, hikers and tour boats. Dangerous waves form and the heat alone can boil fish that can’t escape it alive.“That big white steam plume looks rather harmless, but it’s a superheated steam laced with hydrochloric acid,” she said, and a delta collapse magnifies the danger.Park rangers determine safe viewing areas for patrons with observations carried out by the team at the observatory, but safety isn’t guaranteed. Those interested in viewing the flow in person can follow the observatory’s daily eruption updates and photos, or check out the park’s website and remain cautious."
"Pregnant Women Turn to Marijuana, Perhaps Harming Infants","During her pregnancy, she never drank alcohol or had a cigarette. But nearly every day, Stacey, then 24, smoked marijuana.With her fiancé’s blessing, she began taking a few puffs in her first trimester to quell morning sickness before going to work at a sandwich shop. When sciatica made it unbearable to stand during her 12-hour shifts, she discreetly vaped marijuana oil on her lunch break.“I wouldn’t necessarily say, ‘Go smoke a pound of pot when you’re pregnant,’” said Stacey, now a stay-at-home mother in Deltona, Fla., who asked that her full name be withheld because street-bought marijuana is illegal in Florida. “In moderation, it’s O.K.”Many pregnant women, particularly younger ones, seem to agree, a recent federal survey shows. As states legalize marijuana or its medical use, expectant mothers are taking it up in increasing numbers — another example of the many ways in which acceptance of marijuana has outstripped scientific understanding of its effects on human health.[READ: A Balm When You’re Expecting: Sometimes Pot Does the Trick]Often pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants. But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana’s main psychoactive ingredient — tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC — can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. THC can also be present in breast milk.“There is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use, even in pregnancy, without data to say it’s actually safe,” said Dr. Torri Metz, an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in high-risk pregnancies. Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use.In the federal  survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of mothers-to-be said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2.4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.)Young mothers-to-be were particularly likely to turn to marijuana: Roughly 7.5 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds said they had used pot in the past month in 2014, compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44.Evidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory. Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb.In Pittsburgh, 6-year-olds born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention.Most troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers.“Prenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,” said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.Several studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use. In male fetuses who were exposed, for instance, researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion.“Even early in development, marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors,” said Dr. Yasmin Hurd, a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan. “Those are important for regulation of emotions and reward, even motor function and cognition.”It is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use, even eventually reducing I.Q.“The effects are not dramatic, but that doesn’t mean they are not important,” said Jodi Gilman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studies adolescent users of cannabis. “It could make the difference between getting an A and getting a B.”“You could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana,” she added.The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement. But many state and federal agencies avoid the topic.Of five federal agencies, only the National Institute on Drug Abuse had any information about prenatal marijuana use on its website as of last February, according to a study published online in December in the journal Substance Abuse. Only 10 state health departments did.Until recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered nothing.“I don’t think public health officials should be alarming people,” said Marian Jarlenski, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. “They just have to say, ‘There have been studies done, and there is some risk.’”In a statement, C.D.C. officials expressed concern about memory and attention problems among children exposed to THC in utero.“While current evidence on health consequences is inconsistent, some studies have found risks associated with marijuana use during pregnancy, such as low birth weight or preterm birth,” the agency said.Dr. Marie McCormick, a pediatrician and the chairwoman of a new report on cannabis from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, said smoking cannabis “does confer, in terms of birth weight, the same risk as cigarettes.”Some of the gathering evidence is reassuring. So far, prenatal cannabis exposure does not appear to be linked to obvious birth defects. “That’s why some providers and lay people alike think there’s no effect,” said Dr. Erica Wymore, a neonatologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado. But she warned, “Just because they don’t have a major birth defect or overt withdrawal symptoms doesn’t mean the baby’s neurological development is not impacted.”Most research in this area was done when the drug was far less potent. Marijuana had 12 percent THC in 2014, while in 1995 it was just 4 percent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.“All those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren’t telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels,” said Therese Grant, an epidemiologist and director of the University of Washington’s fetal alcohol and drug unit. “We need to do a whole lot more research now.”There are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use. Research is often based on reports by pregnant women — instead of, say, tests of urine or the umbilical cord — and they consistently underreport their use. (Researchers know of underreporting because samples reveal discrepancies.) And pregnant women who roll joints also tend to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol; it can be hard to tease out the risks of cannabis itself.Few realize that THC is stored in fat and therefore can linger in a mother’s body for weeks, if not months. It’s not known whether the fetus’s exposure is limited to the hours a woman feels high.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises clinicians to ask pregnant women about marijuana use and to urge them to quit.To find out whether that’s happening, Dr. Judy Chang, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Pittsburgh, and her colleagues recorded more than 450 first visits with pregnant patients.Medical staff were more likely to warn patients that child protective services might be called if they used marijuana, the researchers found, than to advise them of potential risks. When mothers-to-be admitted to marijuana use, almost half of obstetric clinicians did not respond at all.Pregnant women aren’t eager to discuss it, either, because they are afraid of legal repercussions or a lecture.Depression, anxiety, stress, pain, nausea and vomiting were the most common reasons women reported using marijuana in a 2014 survey of low-income mothers getting federal nutrition help in Colorado. Roughly 6 percent were pot users; a third were pregnant.“Women are thinking of this as medical marijuana in that they are treating some condition,” said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute who researches substance abuse in pregnancy.“If you’re going to consider it like medicine,” she said, “then treat it like medicine and talk to your doctor about it.”Stacey’s son just had his first birthday. He’s walking, talking and breast-feeding, and she isn’t worried about his development.She still smokes pot — indeed, her son plays on a rug emblazoned with a marijuana leaf. But the severe cramps that plagued her before pregnancy are easing now.“I don’t have to smoke as much anymore,” she said."
"In the Indian Ocean, Fragments of a Continent Where They Should Not Be","Dear Africa, Asia, Antarctica, Australia, Europe, North America and South America:No need to stress.If you’ve heard anything about a newly discovered “lost continent” beneath the Indian Ocean, don’t worry too much: Your spots as the continental magnificent seven are secure.It’s true that geologists have found something strange under the island of Mauritius, the former British colony east of Madagascar with a population of 1.3 million. They’re calling it “Mauritia.” But it’s not a continent like you all are. As Lewis D. Ashwal, the researcher who made the discovery, put it: “It’s a continent in the geological sense, not in the geographical one.”Mauritia is not something people can see, visit or live on, because it's buried beneath millions of years’ worth of volcanic material.Dr. Ashwal, who is a geologist at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in South Africa, published the study Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. But he said it might be better to refer to Mauritia as a continental fragment or microcontinent rather than as a “lost continent.”So what is Mauritia anyway, and where did it come from?Remember about 200 million years ago when you were going through one of your “supercontinent” phases? Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia had joined together with India and Madagascar to form Gondwana. When that rock band broke up and you all drifted your separate ways, you left a piece behind. You probably didn’t notice because it was small. Then about seven million years ago it was blanketed in lava when a volcano in the ocean erupted, creating the island of Mauritius.At least that’s what Dr. Ashwal thinks happened. He based his hypothesis on tiny sparkly minerals called zircon that he found on Mauritius. Zircon contains radioactive material that allows geologists to easily date it back billions of years.The island of Mauritius is thought to be only about nine million years old, and the oceanic crust it was thought to be resting on could not possibly be more than about 200 million years old.But when Dr. Ashwal dated the zircon crystals he found on Mauritius, he discovered they were around three billion years old, much older than any oceanic crust and much, much older than Mauritius.“The results we got were spectacularly surprising, unexpected ones,” he said. The only way zircon crystals that old could have ended up on the Mauritius Island, he said, is if there were fragments of a continent beneath the island.“We found continental crust in the middle of oceanic crust where it shouldn’t be,” he said. Dr. Ashwal thinks a volcanic eruption from the Earth’s mantle lifted zircon flakes from Mauritia’s continental crust and ejected them onto the surface of the Mauritius Island.He said the findings showed that continental breakups, like the one that split Gondwana, are more complicated than previously thought because they can leave big pieces and little pieces all over the planet.But you already knew that continental breakups are complicated. After all, in your billions of years on Earth you’ve gone through plenty."
Of a Frog’s Slap Shot and Saliva,"You never know when a frog playing an electronic game will lead to an experiment on the physics of saliva.But then, who even knew that frogs could play electronic games?So let’s start with that.Alexis C. Noel, a Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech, and her supervisor, David L. Hu, were watching a viral YouTube video in which a frog is attacking the screen of a smartphone running an ant-smashing game. It appears to be winning.They started wondering how — in reality — frog tongues stick to insects so quickly when they shoot out to grab them, and decided it was a phenomenon worth studying.“It’s been an adventure ever since,” Ms. Noel said.First, the whole frog tongue slap shot occurs in the blink of an eye, requiring Ms. Noel and her colleagues to shoot high-speed video of a variety of frogs at the Atlanta Botanical Garden and Zoo Atlanta.Then they ran tests on the saliva itself and the frog tissue.Ms. Noel fondly recalled spending hours at night in the lab scraping tongues from dissected frogs donated by a biology class at the university.“I needed about a fifth of a teaspoon of saliva,” she said.With data on the speed of the tongue shot and retraction, the viscosity — or stickiness — of the saliva, and the softness of the tongue tissue, they came up with a computer simulation to test their ideas of what was going on.What they found was that frog saliva, which is normally 50,000 times stickier than human saliva, flows freely when it hits an insect.That makes the saliva a non-Newtonian fluid, which means that the speed at which it flows (to be precise, its shear rate) changes how viscous it is.In the case of frog saliva, the faster it is forced to flow, the looser it gets. When the frog tongue hits a cricket, the saliva becomes 100 times less viscous and flows around the cricket into every little crevice.By the time the frog starts to pull its tongue back, in a much smoother and slower motion than the body slam attack, the saliva has gotten thick and sticky again and the tongue has wrapped all around the cricket.There is one more step. The frog has to get the cricket unstuck and into its stomach. What helps here is that frog swallowing involves retracting its  eyeballs — so violently that it loosens up the saliva again.The researchers published their findings in Royal Society Interface. Dr. Hu said the detailed understanding of how the process worked had obvious applications for the growing field of soft robots made of very flexible materials.Not that they will have tongues, but they may need to grab and release — who knows what — with appendages more like tongues than metal claws.Ms. Noel said her research was “all about how you grab things with very soft surfaces.”She is also studying cat tongues, for instance. They are covered in tiny little curved spikes, like claws, which, oddly enough, are very good at detangling snarls in fur."
Getting Specific About Dizziness,"Dizziness is not a disease but rather a symptom that can result from a huge variety of underlying disorders or, in some cases, no disorder at all. Readily determining its cause and how best to treat it — or whether to let it resolve on its own — can depend on how well patients are able to describe exactly how they feel during a dizziness episode and the circumstances under which it usually occurs.For example, I recently experienced a rather frightening attack of dizziness, accompanied by nausea, at a food and beverage tasting event where I ate much more than I usually do. Suddenly feeling that I might faint at any moment, I lay down on a concrete balcony for about 10 minutes until the disconcerting sensations passed, after which I felt completely normal.The next morning I checked the internet for my symptom — dizziness after eating — and discovered the condition had a name: Postprandial hypotension, a sudden drop in blood pressure when too much blood is diverted to the digestive tract, leaving the brain relatively deprived. The condition most often affects older adults who may have an associated disorder like diabetes, hypertension or Parkinson’s disease that impedes the body’s ability to maintain a normal blood pressure. Fortunately, I am thus far spared any disorder linked to this symptom, but I’m now careful to avoid overeating lest it happen again.“An essential problem is that almost every disease can cause dizziness,” say two medical experts who wrote a comprehensive new book, “Dizziness: Why You Feel Dizzy and What Will Help You Feel Better.” Although the vast majority of patients seen at dizziness clinics do not have a serious health problem, the authors, Dr. Gregory T. Whitman and Dr. Robert W. Baloh, emphasize that doctors must always “be on the alert for a serious disease presenting as ‘dizziness,’” like “stroke, transient ischemic attacks, multiple sclerosis and brain tumors.”Dr. Kevin A. Kerber, a neurotologist at the University of Michigan Health System, told me that dizziness is one of the most common symptoms that primary care and emergency department doctors see, as common as back pain and headache. He cited a nationally representative health survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2008 in which 10 percent of adults said they had felt dizzy within the past year and had been referred to or seen by a health care specialist because of the symptom.Typically, those reporting dizziness in the survey indicated they each had experienced three of the following different types: a spinning or vertigo sensation, including a rocking of yourself or your surroundings; a floating, spacey or tilting sensation; feeling lightheaded, without a sense of motion; feeling as if you are going to pass out or faint; blurring of your vision when you move your head; or feeling off-balance or unsteady.As you can see, reporting a symptom simply as dizziness does not give a doctor much to go on. A major problem, Dr. Kerber said, is that the examining doctor has to decide on the type of dizziness and determine whether there may be a “particularly dangerous cause” like a heart attack or stroke based on “often unreliable” descriptions by patients.People use the word dizziness when referring to lightheadedness, unsteadiness, motion intolerance, imbalance, floating or a tilting sensation. Vertigo, a subtype of dizziness, is an illusion of movement caused by uneven input to the inner ear’s vestibular system that provides a sense of balance and orientation in space. In 2011, an estimated 3.9 million people visited emergency departments with symptoms of dizziness or vertigo.“Patients are generally nonspecific in describing their symptoms,” Dr. Kerber said. “They should spend time thinking about their symptoms before they see the doctor.” Factors to consider, he said, include “timing — does the dizziness occur episodically or is it constant? What seems to set it off — certain positions or particular foods? How long does the symptom last? And what happens over time — does it get worse, stay the same or get better?”Note, too, whether the feelings get worse when you walk, stand up or move your head. Are the episodes accompanied by nausea, and do they occur so suddenly and severely that they force you to sit or lie down?Family members or friends who pay attention to the affected individual’s complaints “can help contribute to a rapid and correct diagnosis,” according to the authors of the new book. Dr. Whitman is an otoneurology specialist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, and Dr. Baloh is director of the neurotology clinic and testing laboratory at the medical center of the University of California, Los Angeles.Two of the most common causes of dizziness are triggered by changes in position. One is called orthostatic hypotension — a reduced flow of blood to the brain that occurs when a person gets up from a sitting or lying position and goes away when the person lies down.The second, called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or B.P.P.V., is not exactly benign to those affected, Dr. Kerber said. It is triggered by a change in head position, for example, when lying down, turning over in bed, or bending the head backward while sitting or standing (called “top shelf vertigo”), the authors of “Dizziness” wrote. The person may feel that the world is moving or spinning or that an object in the room is jumping up and down rhythmically.Vertigo is one of the most disabling causes of dizziness. It arises when tiny calcium particles in the inner ear become dislodged from the balance organ and get stuck in the semicircular canal, where “they cause havoc,” Dr. Kerber explained. When the head is moved, the particles shift and set off a sensitive nerve wired to the eyes, making them jerk and causing dizziness. When the particles settle down, the eyes stop jerking and the dizziness goes away.Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can be caused by a blow to the head or be a result of aging. “Approximately one in five people in their 80s will develop B.P.P.V.,” the authors wrote. It can also affect younger people, particularly those who already have, or will develop, migraine headaches, they noted.Vertigo can be a disabling condition that lasts for weeks, months or even years. Those affected are often unable to work, drive or walk around without falling.However, B.P.P.V. usually responds to a treatment like the Epley maneuver, a sequence of movements that repositions the head and gets the errant particles to go back to where they belong. The maneuver is often performed by a health professional, but patients can learn to do it on their own if the vertigo recurs."
Safety and Disposing of Medications,"Q. Can you make medications safe to flush into the waste stream by using chemicals?A. It is possible, experts on drug chemistry say, but the very wide variety of drugs and their chemical structures make it unlikely that an individual could accomplish this safely and effectively at home.In fact, the Food and Drug Administration publishes a list of drugs that it recommends disposing of without treatment by flushing down the toilet or drain as soon as they are no longer needed, if an authorized collector is not available.“Based on the available data, F.D.A. believes that the known risk of harm to humans from accidental exposure to these medicines far outweighs any potential risk to humans or the environment from flushing them,” the agency says in a fact sheet.Some of these drugs, like strong pain medications, can be dangerous or even fatal if a single dose is taken accidentally. Flushing removes them safely and permanently from the home, while disposing of them in the garbage, even mixed with dirt or cat litter, might still pose a risk. As for the overall risk of drugs in the waste stream, many drugs have traveled via human waste into streams and rivers.The possible environmental impact is not fully known, but amounts comparable to those found in the water supply have been found in some studies to have harmful effects on birds and animals.A World Health Organization report identifies some ways to neutralize or remediate such emissions through waste water treatment methods including filtration, treatment with ozone and oxidation. question@nytimes.com"
A Diver Discovers a Candy-Colored Crab,"Ellen Muller, an underwater photographer and environmentalist, was exploring a site in the National Marine Park of the Caribbean island of Bonaire when she noticed an unusual hermit crab. She collected one and turned it over to Rafael Lemaitre, a zoologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington.It turned out to be a previously unknown species, now named Pylopaguropsis mollymullerae, after Ms. Muller’s granddaughter Molly.Its common name is candy-striped hermit crab, so called for its bright red and white bands. Vivid colors are typical of crabs that clean parasites from fish in exchange for protection.Dr. Lemaitre, who published a description of the animal in the journal Zookeys, suggests that it might have a symbiotic relationship with moray eels. One of them was found crawling on a moray, and it seemed to be sharing the eel’s den.The crab, about an inch across, was found living at a depth of 45 feet. Like other hermit crabs, it shelters in the disused shell of another animal, which it carries wherever it goes."
Picking the Right Over-the-Counter Pain Reliever,"Picking the pain reliever that’s best for you can be a confusing task. Pharmacy and supermarket shelves are lined with a dizzying array of boxes, names and labels describing the symptoms the medications are intended to address.While they all share the same goal, making you feel better, their active ingredients vary, and all have potential drawbacks.Dr. Robert A. Duarte, director of the Pain Center at Northwell Health in Great Neck, N.Y., cautioned that consumers should not be lulled into thinking that over-the-counter pain relievers are free from potential harm just because they are available on store shelves.Sales of over-the-counter medications exceeded $30 billion in 2015, with pain relievers ranking near the top, according to industry statistics.Consumers need to be informed about what they are taking, and in what doses. A survey conducted in 2001 for the National Council on Patient Information and Education found that only one-third of those polled could identify the active ingredient in their pain reliever.A similar fraction of consumers said they had taken more than the recommended dose of nonprescription medication because they believed it would increase its effectiveness.Dr. Sadiah Siddiqui, an anesthesiologist specializing in interventional pain medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine in Manhattan, said consumers need to read the labels of the medications for their active ingredients.Those who take any kind of over-the-counter pain reliever around the clock for a week or more should see a specialist or their doctor, she added.Here are the major categories of nonprescription pain relievers and some of what you should know about them:Common brand name: TylenolRecommended to treat: Headaches, pain and feverPotential side effects:The Food and Drug Administration recommends a maximum of 4,000 milligrams per day. Exceeding that level can mean the liver has to work harder. Clinicians recommend a daily maximum dose of 3,000 if it is taken for an extended period.What else you should know: Concerns about potential liver damage from taking acetaminophen have been clouded over time, Dr. Duarte said. The warnings surfaced because patients were taking Tylenol with other over-the-counter medications or prescriptions that also contained acetaminophen.For instance, the prescription painkiller Percocet and over-the-counter cold and flu remedies have Tylenol in them. When patients take those drugs as well as Tylenol, they can unwittingly get higher doses of acetaminophen than they should, he said.“You may not think you are taking that much Tylenol, but yes you are,” he said.Common brand names: Advil, MotrinRecommended to treat: Arthritic, joint and dental pain and headachesPotential side effects: Stomach bleeding and kidney problems are risks, particularly for patients who are 60 or older, Dr. Duarte said.What else you should know: Ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory that combats prostaglandins, the chemicals associated with pain such as menstrual cramps, joint pain and headaches that are released in the body.Common brand names: Bayer and St. Joseph. It is also found in Excedrin.Recommended to treat: Headaches and pain from inflammation. It is also used to prevent strokes and promote heart health.Potential side effects: Gastric bleeding and kidney dysfunction; children up to their mid-teenage years should not take aspirin because it is linked to Reye syndrome, which causes brain and liver damage.What else you should know: When it comes to Excedrin and Excedrin for migraines, opt for the less expensive basic product because they both have the same active ingredients, Dr. Duarte said, adding, “Don’t be fooled by packaging.”In general, he said, regardless of what product you take, don’t think that if some is good, more is better.If you have an underlying history of headaches and you are regularly taking over-the-counter pain relievers, you can be at risk of a “rebound headache” caused by the drugs wearing off and the onset of another headache.Some natural products, such as magnesium (400 to 600 milligrams a day) or riboflavin (400 milligrams a day), or using aromatherapy with peppermint oil can help with migraines and muscle pain, he said.Patients should discuss all the medications they take with their doctor.“A simple over-the-counter, in fact, has risks just the way a prescription does,” Dr. Duarte said. “A lot of the patients don’t take these medications seriously.”"
Turning the Tide Against Cholera,"SUNDARBANS NATIONAL PARK, BangladeshTwo hundred years ago, the first cholera pandemic emerged from these tiger-infested mangrove swamps.It began in 1817, after the British East India Company sent thousands of workers deep into the remote Sundarbans, part of the Ganges River Delta, to log the jungles and plant rice. These brackish waters are the cradle of Vibrio cholerae, a bacterium that clings to human intestines and emits a toxin so virulent that the body will pour all of its fluids into the gut to flush it out.Water loss turns victims ashen; their eyes sink into their sockets, and their blood turns black and congeals in their capillaries. Robbed of electrolytes, their hearts lose their beat. Victims die of shock and organ failure, sometimes in as little as six hours after the first abdominal rumblings.Cholera probably had festered here for eons. Since that first escape, it has circled the world in seven pandemic cycles that have killed tens of millions.Artists of the 19th century often depicted it as a skeleton with a scythe and victims heaped at its feet. It stalked revelers at a masked ball in Heinrich Heine’s “Cholera in Paris” and kills the protagonist in Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice.” Outbreaks forced London, New York and other cities to create vast public water systems, transforming civic life.Today cholera garners panicky headlines when it strikes unexpectedly in places like Ethiopia or Haiti. But it is a continuing threat in nearly 70 countries, where more than one billion people are at risk.Now, thanks largely to efforts that began in cholera’s birthplace, a way to finally conquer the long-dreaded plague is in sight.A treatment protocol so effective that it saves 99.9 percent of all victims was pioneered here. The World Health Organization estimates that it has saved about 50 million lives in the past four decades.Just as important, after 35 years of work, researchers in Bangladesh and elsewhere have developed an effective cholera vaccine. It has been accepted by the W.H.O. and stockpiled for epidemics like the one that struck Haiti in 2010. Soon, there may be enough to begin routine vaccination in countries where the disease has a permanent foothold.Merely creating that stockpile — even of a few million doses — profoundly improved the way the world fought cholera, Dr. Margaret Chan, secretary general of the W.H.O., said last year. Ready access to the vaccine has made countries less tempted to cover up outbreaks to protect tourism, she said.That has sped up emergency responses and attracted more vaccine makers, lowering costs. “More cholera vaccines have been deployed over the last two years than in the previous 15 years combined,” Dr. Chan said.The treatment advances relied heavily on research and testing done at the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, known as the ICDDR,B, in Dhaka.Although Dhaka may not be the first place one might look to find a public health revolution, the center is famous among experts in gut diseases.While its upper levels are quiet and scholarly, the center’s ground floor is the world’s largest diarrhea hospital. Its vast wards treat 220,000 patients a year, almost all of whom recover within 36 hours. Doctors there save hundreds of lives a day.The ICDDR,B was originally the Cholera Research Laboratory, founded in 1960 by the United States as part of that era’s “soft diplomacy.” Research hospitals were built in friendly countries both to save lives locally and to act as sentinels for diseases that might threaten America.The wards, which in the rainy season extend into circus-size tents in the parking lot, contain long rows of “cholera cots.” On each iron or wood frame is a plastic sheet with a hole in the middle. A bucket beneath the hole catches diarrhea, while another beside the cot fills with vomit. An IV pole completes the setup.Defying expectations, the ward smells only of the antiseptic that the floors are constantly mopped with.Patients with severe watery diarrhea arrive around the clock, many of them carried in — limp, dehydrated and barely conscious — by friends or family. A nurse sees each one immediately, and those close to death get an IV line inserted within 30 seconds.It contains a blend of glucose, electrolytes and water. Cholera spurs the intestines to violently flush themselves, but it does not actually damage the gut cells. If the fluid is replaced and the bacteria flushed out or killed by antibiotics, the patient is usually fine.Within hours, patients start to revive. As soon as they can swallow, they get an antibiotic and start drinking a rehydration solution. Most walk out within a day. The techniques perfected here are so effective that the ICDDR,B has sent training teams to 17 cholera outbreaks in the past decade.Usually, the only patients who stay long in the hospital are infants so malnourished that another bout of diarrhea would kill them. They live for up to a month in a separate ward with their mothers, who are taught how to cook nutritious porridges from the cheapest lentils, squash, onions, greens and oil.Only about 20 percent of the patients at the center have cholera. The rest usually have rotavirus, salmonella or E. coli. The same therapy saves them all, but the cholera cases are more urgent because these patients plummet so precipitously toward death.“I thought I was dying,” Mohammed Mubarak, a gaunt 26-year-old printing press worker, said one afternoon from his cot. His roommates had carried him in at 7 that morning, unconscious and with no detectable pulse.Now, after six liters of intravenous solution, he was still weak but able to sit up and drink the rehydration solution and eat bits of bread and banana.“His stool is changing from rice-water to green, so he is recovering,” said Momtaz Begum, the ward nurse who monitors the buckets and makes sure patients take in as much liquid as they lose.Mr. Mubarak had first fallen ill at about 2 a.m., a few hours after he drank tap water with his dinner. “Usually I drink safe water, filtered water,” he explained. “But I drank the city water last night. I think that is what did this.”Cholera, born in the swamps, arrived long ago in Dhaka. The city is home to more that 15 million, and a third of the population lives in slums. In some places, water pipes made of rubbery plastic are pierced by illegal connections that suck in sewage from the gutters they traverse and carry pathogens down the line to new victims, like Mr. Mubarak.Vibrio cholerae travels from person to person via fecal matter. In 1854, the epidemiologist John Snow famously traced cases to a single well dug near a cesspit in which a mother had washed the diaper of a baby who died of cholera and nd convinced officials to remove the well’s pump handle.Because cholera is a constant threat to hundreds of millions of people lacking safe drinking water in China, India, Nigeria and many other countries, scientists have long sought a more powerful weapon: a cheap, effective vaccine.Now they have one.Injected cholera vaccines were first invented in the 1800s and were long required for entry into some countries. But many scientists suspected they did not work, and in the 1970s studies overseen by the ICDDR,B confirmed that.In the 1980s, a Swedish scientist, Dr. Jan Holmgren, invented an oral vaccine that worked an impressive 85 percent of the time. But it was expensive to make and had to be drunk with a large glass of buffer solution to protect it from stomach acid.Transporting tanks of buffer was impractical. Making matters worse, it was fizzy, and poor Bangladeshi children who had never tasted soft drinks would spit it out as soon as it tickled their noses.In 1986, a Vietnamese scientist, Dr. Dang Duc Trach, asked for the formula, believing he could make a bufferless version. Dr. Holmgren and Dr. John D. Clemens, an American vaccine expert who at the time was a research scientist for the ICDDR,B, obliged.“This isn’t an elegant vaccine — it’s just a bunch of killed cells, technology that’s been around since Louis Pasteur,” said Dr. Clemens, who is now the ICDDR,B’s executive director.He and Dr. Holmgren lost touch with Dr. Dang, largely because of Vietnam’s isolation in those days. But seven years later, Dr. Dang notified them that he had made a new version of the vaccine. He had tested it on 70,000 residents of Hue, in central Vietnam, and had found it to be 60 percent effective.Although his was not as effective as Dr. Holmgren’s, it cost only 25 cents a dose. If enough people in an area can be made immune through vaccination, outbreaks often stop spontaneously.In 1997, Vietnam became the first — and thus far, only — country to provide cholera vaccine to its citizens routinely, not just in emergencies. Cases dropped sharply, according to a 2014 study, and in 2003 cholera vanished from Hue, where the campaign focused most heavily.But Dr. Dang had not conducted a classic clinical trial, and Vietnam’s vaccine factory did not meet W.H.O. standards, so no United Nations agency was allowed to buy his vaccine.Because no pharmaceutical company had an incentive to pay for trials or factories, his invention languished in “the valley of death” — the expensive gap between a product that works in a lab and a factory-made version safe for millions.In 1999, Dr. Clemens approached what is now the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was just getting organized.“They were literally operating out of a basement then,” he said. “I got a letter from Bill Gates Sr. It was very relaxed, sort of, ‘Here’s $40 million. Would you mind sending me a report once in a while?’“But without that,” Dr. Clemens continued, “this wouldn’t have seen the light of day.”With that money, Dr. Clemens reformulated Dr. Dang’s vaccine, conducted a successful clinical trial in Calcutta and found an Indian company, Shantha Biotechnics, that could make it to W.H.O. standards.Rolled out in 2009 under the name Shanchol, it came in a vial about the size of a chess rook, needed no buffer and cost less than $2 a dose. Even so, there was little interest, even from the W.H.O.The vaccine lacked the publicity campaign that pharmaceutical companies throw behind commercial products, and “cholera ward care” was saving many lives — when it could be organized. The new vaccine was not used in a cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe in 2009, or initially in Haiti’s explosive outbreak in 2010.The “valley of death” lengthened: Without customers, Shantha could not afford to build a bigger factory. The impasse was broken only when Dr. Paul Farmer, a founder of Partners in Health, which has worked in central Haiti since 1987, began publicly berating the W.H.O. for not moving faster.The agency approved Shanchol in 2011, and since then, the vaccine has slowly gained acceptance. In 2013, an emergency stockpile was started, and the GAVI Alliance committed $115 million to raise it to six million doses.The vaccine is now used in Haiti, and has been deployed in outbreaks in Iraq, South Sudan and elsewhere. A second version, Euvichol, from South Korea, was approved in 2015.And later this year, Bangladesh — where it all began — hopes to begin wiping out its persistent cholera. A local company has begun making a domestic version of the vaccine, called Vaxchol. Dr. Firdausi Qadri, a leading ICDDR,B researcher, estimated last year that success there would require almost 200 million doses.The world finally has a vaccine that, with routine administration, could end one of history’s great scourges. But what will happen is still hazy.With 1.4 billion people at risk, the potential cost of vaccination in cholera-endemic countries is enormous. And the disease tends to move, surging and vanishing among the many causes of diarrhea.Even Bill Gates, who paid for much of the research, has asked: “We actually have a cholera vaccine, but where should it be used?”Looking back on his long struggle to prove the vaccine’s value, and then to win acceptance, Dr. Clemens offered an explanation that blended wistfulness and cynicism. “We’re probably not bad scientists,” he said, “but we were lousy advocates.“If this disease had been in American kids, there would have been trials as fast as the Salk polio vaccine.”"
"Meteor Puts on a Light Show Over Midwest, and for the Cameras","A fiery meteor streaked across the Midwest sky early Monday morning, seen as far west as Nebraska and as far east as New York.Unfortunately for scientists who would like to study where it came from and how it got here (although perhaps fortunately for people living in the vicinity), all of the surviving bits of rock plopped into Lake Michigan.The American Meteor Society has received more than 350 reports from witnesses of the green fireball, which occurred around 1:25 a.m. local time. William B. Cook, a NASA meteor expert, reported in a email to NASA headquarters that the fireball originated about 60 miles above West Bend, Wis., moving about 38,000 miles an hour toward the northeast before disintegrating about 21 miles above Lake Michigan.As the meteor fell apart, it emitted low-frequency sounds that were recorded in the Canadian province of Manitoba, about 600 miles away. The blast released energy that was equal to at least 10 tons of TNT, Dr. Cook said, suggesting that the object that entered the atmosphere was at least 600 pounds and two feet in diameter.Most of the reports came from Wisconsin and Illinois.Michael Hankey of the American Meteor Society said such fireballs happen every day somewhere, but only rarely — perhaps four a year — do they occur over populated areas of the United States where the light show can be captured by dashboard cameras, security cameras and night owls carrying cellphones.“There were just a ton of videos,” Mr. Hankey said. “That was unique.”Marc D. Fries, another NASA scientist, said that weather radar captured the shower of meteorites and that he was analyzing the data to estimate the masses of the meteorites and where they fell.From the multitude of reports, scientists should be able to calculate the trajectory of the object, which most likely originated in the asteroid belt. (An asteroid is a rock orbiting in the inner solar system, usually between Mars and Jupiter. A meteor is the streak of light as an asteroid enters the atmosphere. A meteorite is an asteroid remnant that makes it to the ground.)Philipp R. Heck, a scientist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, said the fireball seemed comparable to one that fell over a southern suburb of Chicago in 2003. Meteorites as heavy as several pounds hit the ground, some damaging homes. With the asteroid remnants, scientists could study the mineralogy in detail, even estimating how many million years it took for the asteroid to cross paths with Earth.But it is unlikely that anyone will find pieces of Monday’s meteor. Mr. Hankey said the biggest meteorites were probably the size of baseballs, sunk in the sediments at the bottom of Lake Michigan.“Good luck finding that,” he said."
Newly Discovered Gecko Escapes Danger Naked and Alive,"The fish-scale gecko has a freaky way of eluding danger. When snatched by an attacker, it rips off its scales and skin so it can slip away unscathed. Basically, it streaks to survive.“It looks like a fish until you grab it, and then it looks like a naked chicken breast,” said Mark D. Scherz, a doctoral candidate at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. The torn-away scales reveal the gecko’s pink flesh, and through its translucent tissue you can see its spine and blood vessels. “It’s bizarre, it’s really surprising, and it’s quite uncomfortable when you see them,” he said.It may seem like a gruesome getaway, but it doesn’t hurt the lizard. It loses its skin and scales with extreme ease and regenerates them in full a few weeks later. The new scales grow in with a different pattern than the previous ones, but other than that are nearly indistinguishable from the originals.Mr. Scherz and his colleagues discovered a new species of fish-scale gecko in the limestone karst of northern Madagascar, and published their findings Tuesday in the journal PeerJ. Known as Geckolepis megalepis, it has the largest scales of any fish-scale gecko, some of which measure about 8 percent of its body length. That would be like a person having scales about the size of hands covering parts of the body, according to Mr. Scherz.“You would think they are somehow protective but really they are a decoy there for blocking the teeth or claws of whatever wants to eat them,” Mr. Scherz said of the giant scales. “They get stuck in those jaws or claws and allow the gecko to escape naked and alive.”Fish-scale geckos have long mesmerized herpetologists with their Houdiniesque escapes, but scientists are still not sure how many species of the lizards exist. A genetic analysis in 2013 suggested there might be about 10 species, but, including the new discovery, only five have been recognized so far. Researchers are working to confirm the new species through different methods.Mr. Scherz and his colleagues ascertained that G. megalepis was its own species by using a micro-CT scan to compare its skeletal structure with the previously recognized species of Geckolepis. The subtle differences they found in its eye bones and other parts of its body, in addition to the enormous size of its scales, led them to determine that it was distinct, and the first new Geckolepis to be discovered in about 75 years.Though Mr. Scherz has never grabbed G. megalepis in the wild, he said he had had plenty of experiences trying to snag their kin. Because of their speed, agility and tearaway scales, “they are nightmares to catch.”"
"Plain Old Vaping Gives Way to ‘Dripping’ Among Teenagers, Study Says","Teenagers have found a new way to worry their parents. Never mind plain old vaping — now, it’s all about dripping.The term refers to the practice of applying nicotine liquid directly to the heated coils of an e-cigarette or other vaporizer to produce thick clouds of nicotine vapor.A new Yale University study of high school students in Connecticut, published in the journal Pediatrics, suggested that the approach was gaining favor among teenagers as a way to produce more flavorful clouds of vapor and “a stronger throat hit.”Of the teenagers who reported using e-cigarettes, about a fourth said they had hacked the devices to allow dripping.The study defines e-cigarettes, which come in a variety of forms, as tools that “electrically heat and vaporize e-liquids to produce inhalable vapors.” Those liquids typically contain nicotine and are available in different flavors.In dripping, the liquid is manually applied to the e-cigarette’s heated inner coil, rather than allowing it to flow there via an automatic wick system.The study was based on anonymous surveys of 7,045 high school students in Connecticut. A full 1,874 said they had indulged in vaping with e-cigarettes at some point, though researchers counted only 1,080 after winnowing out some surveys with inconsistent answers. Of those, 282 said they had tried dripping.Dr. Suchitra Krishnan-Sarin, a psychiatry professor at Yale and lead author of the study, wasn’t surprised about the prevalence of vaping. “Teens are certainly drawn to both the novelty of the product and the availability of different flavors,” she said.A CBS News report and other summaries of the Yale findings may have been be the first that many parents had heard of the practice. But Blake Brown, 32, who blogs extensively about vaping, said in a phone interview that dripping is nothing new.“There’s a side of vaping that’s super simple, and that’s what most of the public sees,” he said. “There’s also a different side to vaping where people like to tinker around with things, take things apart.”Manufacturers, he added, have already caught on to the dripping trend and created vaping devices that feature exposed coils, allowing users easier access to drip their liquid manually.“You’re getting more of a smooth draw and the flavor is enhanced greatly,” he said. “Compared to the standard e-cigs you can get, it’s like, you can go buy a Prius or you can go buy a Corvette.”Mr. Brown emphasized, however, that vaping is for adults — not teenagers.The Yale study was not designed to investigate health risks, but Dr. Krishnan-Sarin pointed to recent research from the American University of Beirut suggesting that dripping — which can expose the nicotine liquid to higher temperatures than normal — may release higher levels of carcinogens.She said more research is necessary to fully understand the long-term effects of vaping and e-cigarettes.Lawmakers have scrambled to regulate vaping, which gained popularity only recently as an alternative to traditional methods of smoking and chewing tobacco. According to a history compiled by the Consumer Advocates for Smoke Free Alternatives Association, modern e-cigarettes did not make their way to the United States until 2006. (The organization also documents a smattering of prototype patents dating as far back as 1930.)Differing state approaches led to a patchwork of regulations until last year, when federal law made it illegal to sell e-cigarettes to anyone under 18.But as the Yale study makes clear, teenagers — in Connecticut, at least — are undeterred by the law.“My message to parents always is: It’s not a good idea for your kids to use these e-cigarettes until we know more about the safety and toxicity of these products,” Dr. Krishnan-Sarin said."
Licorice During Pregnancy Tied to Problems in Children,"Pregnant women may want to avoid licorice, which may affect the cognitive abilities of their children, a study suggests.Licorice contains glycyrrhizin, a sweetener derived from the root of the licorice plant, and is used to flavor candies, soft drinks, herbal teas and other products. Pills and supplements containing concentrated licorice are also a popular herbal remedy for respiratory ailments and other ills.The analysis, in The American Journal of Epidemiology, included 1,049 mothers and their healthy infants born in Finland in 1998. Eleven percent of the mothers consumed more than 500 milligrams of glycyrrhizin a week, the amount found in about 8.8 ounces of pure licorice (many licorice candies and foods contain anise flavorings and only small amounts of glycyrrhizin).At age 13, compared with those whose mothers ate the least licorice, those whose mothers consumed the most averaged seven points lower on I.Q. tests and had triple the risk for attention deficit disorder problems. Girls in the high-consumption group also tended to reach puberty earlier and have a higher body mass index.Glycyrrhizin increases levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, which may affect development of the fetal nervous system.“We know that there are limitations in observational studies like this,” said the lead author, Katri Raikkonen, of the University of Helsinki. “But we have tried to account for numerous variables, and we know from animal studies that there are detrimental consequences for offspring of mothers who consume glycyrrhizin. Insofar as you can avoid it during pregnancy, you should do so.”"
Saiga Antelopes Are Struck Again by a Plague in Central Asia,"They found the first carcasses in late December, on the frozen steppes of Mongolia’s western Khovd province.By the end of January, officials in the region had recorded the deaths of 2,500 endangered saiga antelopes — about a quarter of the country’s saiga population — and scientists had identified a culprit: a virus called peste des petits ruminants, or P.P.R., also known as goat plague.It was the first time the disease, usually seen in goats, sheep and other small livestock, had been found in free-ranging antelopes. For the saiga, an ancient animal that once roamed the grasslands of the world with the woolly mammoth and the saber-toothed tiger, the outbreak was potentially catastrophic.The antelope’s numbers, once in the millions, have been severely depleted by illegal hunting, habitat loss and competition for food. The species is described as critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List.In 2015, 211,000 saigas in Kazakhstan — more than half of the entire antelope species — were wiped out by a bacterial infection in less than a month.“It’s just one thing on top of another,” said Dr. Richard Kock, a professor of wildlife health and emerging diseases at the Royal Veterinary College in London who, with colleagues, concluded that climate change had contributed to the Kazakhstan die-off.“Once you’re down to very low numbers, a species is vulnerable to extinction,” Dr. Kock said. “You have to wake up to the fact that these populations really are on the brink, and you can’t do anything about it if it’s gone.”Dr. Kock, who has studied both saigas and P.P.R. in wildlife, recently returned from Mongolia, where he was part of a United Nations crisis team called in to investigate the mass deaths there. He and other scientists predicted that before the virus had run its course, thousands more saigas from the Mongolian population will die.And the appearance of P.P.R. in the antelope, which probably contracted the virus from close contact with livestock that graze on the steppe, raised fears that it could spread to other threatened species, like Bactrian camels and Mongolian gazelles.“Potentially, this could be an 80 percent mortality,” said Eleanor J. Milner-Gulland, a zoology professor at Oxford and chairwoman of the Saiga Conservation Alliance. “It could be completely disastrous.”Dr. Milner-Gulland noted that the spring, when the antelopes gather together to calve, could be an especially risky time for the spread of the virus, and there is concern that it could spread to antelopes remaining in Kazakhstan.The saigas are well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Mongolian steppe, their thick hair insulating them in the winter and their Bullwinkle noses warming frigid winter air before it reaches the lungs. The Mongolian saiga is a subspecies, smaller and stockier than its Kazakhstan counterparts, with horns of a different shape and a slightly more refined proboscis.But both subspecies are valuable to wildlife traffickers, who poach the animals and market the horns for medicinal use in Asian countries.Enkhtuvshin Shiilegdamba, an epidemiologist and the Wildlife Conservation Society’s country director in Mongolia, said that scientists believe the virus traveled to Mongolia from China, one of 76 countries around the world where P.P.R. is active. Livestock in Khovd province began to fall ill in September, Dr. Enkhtuvshin said.She added that the number of deaths so far was probably an underestimate, because the antelope are smallish animals and “this area is quite a large area and there is snow, so it makes it difficult to find them.“It’s likely that we already lost about 50 percent of the saiga population,” she added. Even before the virus hit, a fiercely harsh winter in 2015 had reduced the population to approximately 10,000 saigas from about 15,000. P.P.R. is also suspected in the deaths of 22 black-tailed gazelles and at least one ibex.Dr. Kock said that many of the dead antelope they examined were in poor physical condition, probably contributing to their susceptibility to disease.The die-off, he said, came at the worst time of year, during the winter, when the animals’ resistance is lower. “That is extremely bad luck and that will be reflected in the mortalities,” he said.About 11 million sheep and goats in Khovd and in a second province where saigas live were vaccinated against P.P.R. after the initial outbreak, but the vaccine was apparently not effective in preventing the virus from spreading to wildlife, suggesting that some animals were missed or that there were storage problems with the vaccines.“I think there is commitment in the country and the political will to address the situation,” said Bouna Diop, who is directing a United Nations campaign to eradicate P.P.R. by 2030.But, he added, “there are some gaps that need to be improved, to make sure when they are vaccinating they are using good vaccine, and the vaccination is done properly.”If the saiga does survive, it may be its capacity for rapid reproduction that finally saves it. Two-thirds of pregnant female antelopes give birth to twins, and although the species plummeted to a low of 50,000 saiga in the 1990s, it rebounded with conservation efforts, reaching several hundred thousand by the time of the Kazakhstan die-off.“It has gone down to low levels before and then gone back up again, so we’re always hopeful,” Dr. Milner-Gulland said."
Lava Fire Hose in Hawaii Returns for an Encore,"Lava lovers, rejoice. A Hawaiian fire hose of lava that gushed for a whole month, and then seemed to disappear last week, has become visible again as it deposits even more liquefied rock into the ocean.From an exposed tube in a sea cliff of a volcano near the island of Hawaii, hundreds of millions of gallons of lava have been streaming into the Pacific. The lava continues to cause explosive reactions with a superheated cloud of hydrochloric acid when it reaches the water. And there is still no sign of the formation of a delta that would stop the flow of lava.The flow has a name — 61g — and from behind a cloud of steam, it continued to stream into the sea after the cliff partly collapsed on Thursday. Two days later, visitors on a tour boat exalted in the return of the show’s fluorescent violence.“We don’t know for certain that the fire hose flow ever ended,” said Janet Babb, a geologist at the United States Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. The persistence of steam and explosions after the cliff’s collapse indicated that the flow had not halted, even though the view was obscured.A show this long is extremely rare, drawn out by what geologists think is a sea too deep to allow the formation of a delta. (Picture the delta as an ice cream base of a sundae, with fudge flowing over it.) Without a rocky base to stop it, the lava continues to gush from the cliff.Just how big the chunk of land was that crumbled into the sea last week is still unknown. But it sent out a huge wave with it.So will Hawaii Volcanoes National Park adopt the lava fire hose into its daily attractions? That appears unlikely.“It’s almost certain it will not become a permanent feature,” Ms. Babb said. “Lava tubes form. They’re active for a while, and then they change.”"
"In an Age of Alternative Facts, Bill Nye’s New Show Brings Real Ones","As he prepares to launch a fact-filled show into a fact-challenged world, Bill Nye, a.k.a. the Science Guy, is looking on the bright side.“You have to be optimistic,” the author, engineer and television personality said in a phone interview. “You’re not going to solve global problems or address global issues without being optimistic. If you don’t think you can do anything about it, you won’t.”His new program, “Bill Nye Saves the World,” will premiere as a Netflix original series on April 21. In a statement, Netflix said, “Each episode will tackle a topic from a scientific point of view, dispelling myths, and refuting antiscientific claims that may be espoused by politicians, religious leaders or titans of industry.”Mr. Nye, 61, will be joined by celebrity guests like the model Karlie Kloss, the actor Rachel Bloom and the fashion consultant Tim Gunn. A Netflix representative said the 13 episodes, each 30 minutes long, will be released all at once.A new trailer for the series was released on Wednesday.With President Trump’s administration embroiled in debates over blatant falsehoods, “alternative facts,” and “fake news,” Mr. Nye’s fans are saying the timing of this show couldn’t be better.But the program is not a response to last year’s election. Netflix announced that it was in the works in August, and filming ended in October. In any case, Mr. Nye said: “It’s just a TV show. People don’t have to watch it.”Mr. Nye is famous for his Emmy Award-winning series “Bill Nye the Science Guy.” But fans of that kid-friendly 1990s classic may be disappointed to learn that the upcoming series will have an entirely different format – it’s a talk show, not a children’s’ program.“We have guests, we have a panel of experts, we have what’s essentially a monologue, and we have comedy video pieces that are inserted,” he said. “The comedy bits,” he added, “are brilliant!”Mr. Nye, who is known for wearing bow-ties and has some background in stand-up comedy, never fails to inject a dose of lighthearted humor into his talks and media appearances.Although it is clear he has fundamental disagreements with much of the Republican establishment, he seems to approach hot topics like climate change and the reproductive rights of women with a measure of restraint, deliberately showing respect for opposing viewpoints even when they frustrate him.And while he may get impatient with policy makers who reject scientific findings, he sees no point in getting testy. “As good as it might make us feel to call other people names, it’s probably not in our medium- or long-term interest,” he said. “Optimism may be counter to divisiveness.”The new show will tackle a range of subjects including sex, climate change, technology and alternative medicine. It’s not necessarily meant to be a political program, but Mr. Nye acknowledges that these days, issues like climate change are inherently hot-button – even when they shouldn’t be.“We in the climate science community didn’t politicize it. Other people did,” he said. “People who want to preserve the fossil fuel industries, the extraction industries.”Mr. Nye said he hoped that his show would be picked up for a second season, but there are no guarantees. In the meantime, his plate is full for the coming months. This year he will release a children’s book series, “Jack and the Geniuses,” and a general interest book for adults called “Everything All at Once: How Nerds Solve Problems.”He’s also thinking about attending the March for Science in Washington on April 22, even though he is not involved in organizing the event.And he’ll keep doing whatever he can to make sure that science and critical thinking have a place in political dialogue. “We’ll see what happens, but I’m very proud of the shows,” he said of his Netflix series. “I hope they do influence some people.”"
Lunar Eclipse and Green Comet Make for Busy Friday Night in the Sky,"Two celestial events will take place on Friday night: a lunar eclipse and the passing of a comet.While both sound significant, neither will be much of a spectacle for the casual skygazer. The eclipse will be a penumbral lunar eclipse, meaning that only a portion of Earth’s shadow will cover the moon. Unlike a total lunar eclipse, where the entire moon takes on a reddish color from being engulfed by the Earth’s shadow, the moon will appear only slightly darker than usual during Friday’s eclipse.“These things are very subtle,” said Noah Petro, a research scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “If it’s a cloudy night you might not even notice it.”The best time to try and see the eclipse is around 7:44 p.m. Eastern time. That’s when part of the moon’s top will most noticeably appear gray.The next event, the passing of Comet 45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajdušáková, will also not be very eye-catching for most people. Comet 45P circles the sun about every five years. On Friday night and early Saturday morning, it will be about seven million miles away from Earth, the closest it comes during its orbit. That’s about 30 times the distance between Earth and the moon. Because it’s still relatively far, it will be very hard to see without binoculars or a telescope. If you are able to get one of those tools, the comet should appear as a green dot in the sky because of its chemical components. The best time to try to see it will be in the early hours of Saturday morning, around 3 a.m. Eastern time, but don’t get your hopes up.“It’s not going to be something that you can just look up and say ‘Oh wow!,’” said Michael A. Disanti, a comet scientist at NASA Goddard who has been closely following Comet 45P. “I would not claim that it’s a great viewing opportunity for the public.”While Comet 45P’s visit isn’t a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for skygazers, it is important for scientists, according to Geronimo Villanueva, a planetary scientist from NASA Goddard. The close pass will allow researchers to take better images of the comet, and further determine what it is made of and where it came from, he said."
"Long Before Making Enigmatic Earthworks, People Reshaped Brazil’s Rain Forest","Deep in the Amazon, the rain forest once covered ancient secrets. Spread across hundreds of thousands of acres are massive, geometric earthworks. The carvings stretch out in circles and squares that can be as big as a city block, with trenches up to 12 yards wide and 13 feet deep. They appear to have been built up to 2,000 years ago.Were the broken ceramics found near the entrances used for ritual sacrifices? Why were they here? The answer remains a mystery.For centuries, the enigmatic structures remained hidden to all but a few archaeologists. Then in the 1980s, ranchers cleared land to raise cattle, uncovering the true extent of the earthworks in the process. More than 450 of these geoglyphs are concentrated within Acre State in Brazil.Since the discovery, archaeological study of the earthworks and other evidence has challenged the notion that the rain forests of the Amazon were untouched by human hands before the arrival of European explorers in the 15th century. And while the true purpose of the geoglyphs remains unknown, a study published on Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences offers new insight into the lives of the ancient people who lived in the Amazon. Thousands of years before the earthworks were built, humans were managing the forests, using what appear to be sustainable agricultural practices.“Our study was looking at the environmental impact that the geoglyph builders had on the landscape,” said Jennifer Watling, an archaeologist at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, who conducted the research while a student at the University of Exeter in Britain. “A lot of people have the idea that the Amazon forests are pristine forests, never touched by humans, and that’s obviously not the case.”Dr. Watling and her team reconstructed a 6,000-year-old environmental history of two geoglyph sites in the Amazon rain forest. To do this, they searched for clues in soil samples in and around the sites. Microscopic plant fossils called phytoliths told them about ancient vegetation. Bits of charcoal revealed evidence of burnings. And a kind of carbon dating gave them a sense of how open the vegetation had been in the past.About 4,000 years ago, people started burning the forest, which was mostly bamboo, just enough to make small openings. They may have planted maize or squash, weeded out some underbrush, and transported seeds or saplings to create a partly curated forest of useful tree products that Dr. Watling calls a “prehistoric supermarket.” After that, they started building the geoglyphs. The presence of just a few artifacts, and the layout of the earthworks, suggest they weren’t used as ancient villages or for military defenses. They were likely built for rituals, some archaeologists suspect.Dr. Watling and her colleagues found that in contrast with the large-scale deforestation we see today — which threatens about 20 percent of the largest rain forest in the world — ancient indigenous people of the Amazon practiced something more akin to what we now call agroforestry. They restricted burns to site locations and maintained the surrounding landscape, creating small, temporary clearings in the bamboo and promoting the growth of plants like palm, cedar and Brazil nut that were, and still are, useful commodities. Today, indigenous groups around the world continue these sustainable practices in forests.“Indigenous communities have actually transformed the ecosystem over a very long time,” said Dr. Watling. “The modern forest owes its biodiversity to the agroforestry practices that were happening during the time of the geoglyph builders.”"
How a Little Bit of Hydra Regrows a Whole Animal,"The hydra is a favorite subject of middle school science. It is a fearsome-looking tentacled predator, but it is tiny — less than a half inch — and lives in ponds. You can collect or buy hydras and the tiny crustaceans they eat, then watch the capture under a dissecting microscope. Hydras, like jellyfish, have stinging cells in their tentacles.They usually reproduce by budding. If you cut them up in pieces, the odds are good that a piece will become a new hydra, sometimes a hydra with two heads. But if you want to get children interested in science, that is hardly a drawback.Adult, professional scientists are interested in them too, particularly the way a hydra snippet grows up. For example, one of the great discoveries of modern science, is the way that genes control how a few cells develop into a highly complex organism. Fruit flies, zebrafish and humans share some of the same genes that direct this process.Hydras are much simpler, made of just a few layers of cells. But they still respond to chemical signals sent out by genes as they grow into a tubelike body and tentacle-encircled maw.However, scientists in Israel, who cut up a lot of hydras in the process of their experiments, found that there are structures in even a small bit of hydra that also guide growth.A hydra body has a kind of scaffolding made of protein fibers that act like muscles and help the organism keep its shape. The way these actin fibers are arranged helps determine how the hydra grows, even in a hydra scrap.Kinneret Keren, a physicist at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology who wrote about the research with her colleagues in the journal Cell Reports, said this is not simply a matter of growing along the length of the fibers, because the first thing a bit of hydra does in regenerating a full animal is fold into a sphere. Somehow — and this is a subject for future research — the aligned fibers tell the growing ball of cells which direction to grow.Some scraps grow better than others. A ring cut horizontally through the body of the hydra often ends up with a confused alignment of the fibers when it folds into a ball. The result may be a hydra with two heads.Not an insurmountable problem for a hydra. “They’re fine,” Dr. Keren said. She plans to continue work on the hydra. The little animal is a good target for research, she said.“They’re complicated enough, but simple enough.”"
"Is a Teen Depressed, or Just Moody?","The hardest questions pediatricians must routinely ask teenagers at checkups are those about depression and suicide. But they aren’t optional; we have to ask them, every time.From 2005 to 2014, the prevalence of depression — that is, the chance of having a major depressive episode over the course of a year — increased significantly among 12- to 17-year-olds in the United States. These data come from an annual survey, the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health, in which the same structured questions are asked every year. The trend toward more depression was steeper in girls than it was in boys. Furthermore, when 18- to 25-year-olds were surveyed, there was again a significant increase in the prevalence of depression, but only among those 18 to 20. So it appears to be increasing in the population from 12 to 20.Dr. Ramin Mojtabai, a psychiatrist who is a professor in the department of mental health at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins and the first author on the study, said that there was no real increase from 2005 to 2011, but then the rise began, and got more pronounced in 2012 and 2013.Why was the prevalence of depression increasing, and why was it more intense among girls? Were adolescents actually suffering more from depression, or was it possible they were just more willing to talk about it? Dr. Mojtabai said that over the past couple of decades, teenagers have generally been more open about depression, but the researchers didn’t think that could account for the pattern they were seeing.They adjusted for the prevalence of substance abuse, and still the trend was there; it wasn’t explained away by drug use or drinking. Neither could it be accounted for by looking at household composition (two parents versus one parent versus no parents).Suicide is the second leading cause of death in adolescents 15 to 19, second only to accidents, but that rate, as opposed to the incidence of depression, has actually been decreasing since the 1990s. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced last November that the suicide rate for younger children from 10 to 14 had increased to the point where the risk of dying by suicide was as high as the risk of dying in a traffic accident; they were looking at 2014 data, the most recent available.Dr. Benjamin Shain, the head of the division of child and adolescent psychiatry at NorthShore University Health System, was the lead author on the American Academy of Pediatrics’ clinical report last summer on suicide and suicide attempts by adolescents. “When it comes to your child, in a sense statistics don’t matter, what matters is your particular child,” he said. “Pay attention to worry signs.”Too often, he said, the parental impulse is to give advice or even step in and try to fix the problem. “What parents should do is mostly listen, that should be 90 percent of the conversation,” he said. The other 10 percent of the time, parents should not attempt to offer a solution, “but help the child problem solve.” He raised concerns, in particular, about the impact of electronic media on adolescents.Dr. Mojtabai pointed out that the study was missing some information about factors like child abuse and neglect and about screens and digital devices, which some reports have associated with depressive symptoms.“There’s certainly evidence that cyberbullying may be connected to an increase in depression particularly among girls, maybe an increase in suicide,” Dr. Shain said. And this is an area, he said, where many parents feel at a loss about how to guide their children; the parental impulse may be to take away the cellphone, which may make things worse for some adolescents.“They tend to find parent restriction of social media actually more traumatic than whatever the event was,” he said. “That’s how they connect to their peer group, that’s how they get their support, that’s how they have a conversation with their group; you take this away and then you have a very isolated child.”Over all, Dr. Mojtabai said, we need more information about whether there really is a trend here, and much more information about the teenagers’ lives. Still, it’s important for parents to be aware of the risks, both for children who are already struggling with mental health issues, and for those who may not yet have given their feelings a name.“A lot of children and adolescents have psychiatric problems that are not recognized by parents and they go untreated as a result,” he said.The signs of teenage depression include mood changes, like persistent sadness or irritability, and changes in level of functioning, such as school failure. They also include withdrawal from friends and family, a loss of interest in activities that had been important, and changes in eating and sleeping patterns, as well as some pretty nonspecific signs like lack of energy, trouble concentrating and unexplained aches and pains.Any parent of an adolescent has to wonder, of course, what’s the difference between “regular” adolescent mood swings and teenage behaviors and these warning signs. Parents need to ask themselves how severe the symptoms seem, and how persistent. When a child really seems to have changed, you can’t just write it off as adolescence.Dr. Shain pointed out that many of the warning signs are relatively nonspecific; there could be many reasons adolescents might be hiding in their rooms, or bringing home significantly worse grades.“It could be depression, could be drugs, could be simply that their schoolwork is too hard,” he said. “The first step is sit and have a conversation with your child — what’s going on — the next step could be talk with teachers or bring your child to a counselor or psychiatrist.”And though this increase in the prevalence of depression was not explained by substance abuse, it’s important to remember that substance abuse and depression have always gone together in adolescents; those who report depression are more likely to have used drugs or alcohol.Identifying depression, of course, doesn’t solve the problem, and this is not an issue that lends itself to quick fixes, even with caring and supportive families. As the A.A.P. clinical report says: “Suicide risk can only be reduced, not eliminated, and risk factors provide no more than guidance.”This can be a long and hard journey for teenagers and their families, but the message to parents, and to pediatricians, is that we have to keep asking the right questions."
A Race to Document Rare Plants Before These Cliffs Are Ground to Dust,"KAMPONG TRACH MOUNTAIN, Cambodia — Millions of years ago, a cluster of coral reefs stood firm here as the water receded, leaving them surrounded by the marshy, mangrove-studded Mekong Delta.Today, these reefs have been carved by the wind and rain into spiky limestone cliffs known as karsts that stand stark against the Cambodian landscape, even as the lowland rain forest around them has been denuded by centuries of intensive rice cultivation and logging.The karsts are full of nooks and crannies that have nurtured highly specialized plants and animals found nowhere else. They are also important to humans, studded with small altars and temples that are thought to be homes to neak ta, landscape spirits in the local animist pantheon.Soon, they will be gone.A small group of scientists are now racing to document rare plant life in these limestone karsts before local companies quarry them to dust and grind them up for production of the cement that is fueling this country’s building boom.Most of the wood in mainland Southeast Asia has already been logged to support the region’s rapid economic growth and its relentless appetite for luxury hardwood. (Nearly all the forest cover in neighboring Thailand is gone and Cambodia is now experiencing the fastest acceleration of forest loss in the world, despite a putative ban on logging.) Cement and concrete are also in high demand, so the karsts are next in line.“They are the last refuges of what made it to the Mekong Delta, natural harbors for a specialized kind of vegetation that has very little timber value, sanctuaries of rare species,” said J. Andrew McDonald, a botany professor at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, who is spearheading the plant collection project with support from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.The limestone habitats can act as “arks” of biodiversity that replenish surrounding areas after ecological damage. But they are so complex that, once destroyed, they can never themselves be recreated.They have scant access to water for six months of the year, creating a harsh, alkaline environment that has led to the evolution of desertlike flora in the middle of a hot, wet country. Dr. McDonald calls them “Dr. Seuss-type plants,” ones that look and behave like cactuses and succulent desert flora, but are related to the local tropical foliage.There are fat, succulent grapevines, fig trees with thick, waxy leaves, and false cactuses — as spiky and segmented as those that grow in the American desert, but actually members of the poinsettia family that evolved independently. Perhaps most unusual are the large, phallic flowers known as Amorphophallus, which look like a cross between an orchid and a Muppet’s nose.The toughest and most determined plants nestle themselves into the fissures and cracks atop the karsts, or cling to the razor-sharp outcroppings exposed to the wind and sun. More delicate tropical flowers — feathery orchids and little white touch-me-nots — make homes in the grottoes within, sucking up the water that drips through the limestone. At the bottom, the karsts are like Swiss cheese, full of water-carved pockets that open up into large underground lakes where rare bats feed and mushrooms grow.Over four days in January, armed with rice sacks and pruning shears, Dr. McDonald and several colleagues and students pored over two linked karsts, Phnom Kampong Trach and Phnom Domrei, climbing atop their jagged surfaces and passing all the way through them in a network of caves.Dr. McDonald, 62, is a plain-spoken Texan with a mystical streak who spends his spare time working on a 1,000-page manuscript on the religious iconography of the lotus. He can clamber up and down the slippery, precipitous karsts like one of the mountain goats that live here (another anomaly in flat Cambodia).“Fruits! Flowers! Fruits! Flowers! Eyes on the prize!” he chanted, trying to urge the group to collect specimens. Among the group was a pair of technophilic Vietnamese botanists lugging huge cameras who kept falling behind to take close-up shots of the foliage.At first glance, Dr. McDonald was excited by a novel-looking parasitic Balanaflora with droopy, bulbous male flowers (“they latch onto this tree and have sex there”) and a huge, feathery white blossom at the edge of a grotto. It was an unusual variant of dogbane, a nocturnal plant with a dangling structure that dusts the underside of a visiting moth or bat with pollen. “I’ve never seen an Apocynaceae with an irregular flower like that!” he exclaimed, before gingerly tossing the specimens, one by one, across a huge fissure to the safe hands of a waiting colleague.Ultimately, over the course of two botanical excursions, the group found more than 130 species of vascular plants native to this patch of limestone, a comparatively rich assortment, including some thought to be new to science: an Amorphophallus and another related flower, a new type of jasmine, and a member of the coffee family.Along with discovering these rare species, the scientists wanted to document the karsts’s biodiversity and the ways in which different parts of the habitat work together before it is gone. Ultimately, they hope to persuade the government to make these two karsts a protected area and declare them off-limits to future cement quarrying.The team was accompanied by a representative of the Ministry of Environment who was to report back to his superiors on the merits of the protection proposal. The ministry is bereft of plant experts, so they sent Neang Thy, the country’s leading herpetologist, instead.“The vegetation you see here, you may not see anywhere else,” he said. “If it is destroyed, that is a problem.”He said he hoped future trips would allow for a survey of animal life in the karsts. Similar limestone formations in Vietnam and Thailand are home to novel species of fish, lizards, crabs and insects that adapt to life inside caves by becoming pale, blind and wingless, often looking very different from their aboveground brethren.There are highly biodiverse karsts scattered across Southeast Asia, from Vietnam to Borneo, like desert islands surrounded by oceans of tropical rain forest. The destruction of karsts at the hands of cement companies, developers and tourists is a problem throughout the region.But it is particularly acute here, where government regulation is lax and the state of local scientific knowledge fledgling.“They are threatened, as they are elsewhere, but the difference is that there is almost nothing known about the biodiversity of the hills” in Cambodia, said Tony Whitten, the international regional director for Fauna and Flora International’s Asia-Pacific division, who coedited a book on the subject — “Biodiversity and Cultural Property in the Management of Limestone Resources: Lessons from East Asia.”Cambodia has almost no botanists and the study of plants in the country came to a standstill from 1970 to 1992 during an extended period of war and unrest punctuated by the trauma of the Khmer Rouge takeover from 1975 to 1979.The country’s main herbarium is a single room at the Royal University of Phnom Penh. It houses about 12,000 specimens, many of which have not been inventoried and are simply piling up on shelves. They are meant to be kept cool and dry by two air-conditioners, but one air-conditioner is broken and there is no money to fix it.“You talk about a herbarium in another country and it should be very big, but this is just one room,” said Ith Saveng, who runs the university’s Center for Biodiversity Conservation. “We hope to expand to another room within the next two years.”Rare plants found in karsts have to be shipped to Vietnam so better-trained scientists can do the precise work of matching species to species.In Kampot, the scientists were led through some of the more treacherous cave networks by Ken Sam An, a 61-year-old native of a village just below the Phnom Kampong Trach karst. He knows more about these caves than just about anyone else. As a teenager, he watched as the Viet Cong hid in the caves, resulting in retaliatory bombing campaigns by the United States that drove the population to flee. Soon, ultra-Communist rebels swept into the area and he was conscripted into a Khmer Rouge youth unit.Whatever scientific research apparatus still existed was totally dismantled by the victorious Khmer Rouge government, which declared higher education anathema and sent city dwellers back to the land to work as rice farmers and dam builders. Although Mr. Ken Sam An possesses vast botanical knowledge, he has not attended school since the sixth grade.After the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979, Mr. Ken Sam An spent years working for a limestone quarrying company, but now he serves on a local committee that tries to preserve the karsts, urging local residents to stop stripping them and chopping off rocks to sell.“I tell them, ‘If you break the mountain, it’s not good for the environment, and if you work in tourism you can come and sell things to the tourists instead of breaking rocks.’”A far bigger risk is large-scale limestone quarrying by companies producing cement. Kampot (K) Cement, a joint venture between the well-connected local company Khaou Chuly Group and the Thai cement manufacturer Siam Cement, has claim to large karsts in the area. The site is churning out a million tons of cement a year.Another local company, Chip Mong, formed a partnership with a different Thai firm and started building a $262 million factory in the area last year, with the goal of producing 1.5 million tons a year. This is still not enough to slake Cambodia’s growing thirst for cement, expected to reach five million tons this year.The cement firms have also spawned a mini-land boom in Kampot, where prices have risen thirtyfold in the last decade, according to locals. In interviews, the inhabitants complained that rocks being blasted off the mountains were falling on their homes and angering the local neak ta, who had to be propitiated with offerings of roast pigs.Dr. Whitten said he had tried for years, fruitlessly, to determine whether environmental impact assessments had been carried out before cement companies were given permission to dynamite the karsts. The Ministry of Mines and Energy, which is responsible for granting and regulating concessions for limestone quarrying, declined to comment.Even when environmental assessments are conducted, they often focus on large mammals, overlooking plants and small species that are highly endemic to certain caves. The slimy, squishy invertebrates and strange plants that live in karsts can be a hard sell to donors, who prefer what are known as “charismatic megafauna”— cute, easy-to-anthropomorphize animals like elephants, tigers and dolphins that appeal to the public.“It takes a botanist to appreciate the charisma of a plant,” Dr. McDonald said.The karsts his group wants to protect have the advantage of already being a minor tourist attraction, with a Buddhist pagoda sprawling out at their feet, small shrines nestled into the caves and a set of stone steps leading down to an underground pond where monks bathe.“They are linked together — people come to pray at the pagoda and then they always go to the cave,” Mr. Ken Sam An said. It is also common for him and his neighbors to make offerings to the spirits believed to inhabit the karsts, going to different caves on different holy days. Each one is believed to be the domain of a different neak ta.Mr. Ken Sam An can rattle off their names as if they are members of his extended family: “There’s the Red Neck spirit, the Eight Heads spirit, the spirit of the 100 Rice Fields, the spirit of the Monk Who Lives in the Jungle, the White Elephant spirit, the Dragon’s Mouth spirit, the Magic Boy spirit, the Reincarnated Grandmother spirit and the Magic Mushroom spirit.”Altogether, the caves are thought by locals to be chambers in the stomach of a dragon that beached here when an ancient sea receded thousands of years ago — a tale not entirely different from the stories told by geologists and botanists.“This is what we lose when they take out a mountain,” Dr. McDonald said."
Study Finds New Bacterial Strain Can Contaminate Shellfish,"Scientists studying oysters along the East Coast may have discovered why more seafood lovers are getting sick from shellfish. A new strain of the bacteria Vibrio parahaemolyticus, is causing diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain.The strain, ST631, is endemic to the region, but it is unclear how it became so noxious. Research suggests this bacterium and others may be spreading because of climate change.The discovery may reduce the risk of food poisoning. Scientists have developed a model that estimates the odds of bacteria in New Hampshire oysters."
Got Almond Milk? Dairy Farms Protest Milk Label on Nondairy Drinks,"If milk comes from a plant, can you still call it milk?Not according to the dairy industry. Facing growing competition from dairy alternatives like almond, soy and coconut milk, the nation’s dairy farmers are fighting back, with an assist from Congress. Their goal: to stop companies from calling their plant-based products yogurt, milk or cheese. Dairy farmers say the practice misleads consumers into thinking that nondairy milk is nutritionally similar to cow’s milk.A bipartisan group of 32 members of Congress is asking the Food and Drug Administration to crack down on companies that call plant-based beverages “milk.” They say F.D.A. regulations define milk as a “lacteal secretion” obtained by milking “one or more healthy cows.” Proposed legislation from Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, and Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, a state known for its cheese, suggests a slightly broader definition. Their bill would require the F.D.A. to target milk, yogurt and cheese products that do not contain milk from “hooved mammals.”“The bottom line for us is that milk is defined by the F.D.A., and we’re saying to the F.D.A.: Enforce your definition,” Mr. Welch said.But critics say consumers know exactly what they are buying when they choose almond or soy milk instead of dairy milk. “There’s no cow on any of these containers of almond milk or soy milk,” said Michele Simon, executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association, a trade group representing 70 companies. “No one is trying to fool consumers. All they’re trying to do is create a better alternative for people who are looking for that option.”And what about other nondairy products with dairy names? Will milk of magnesia, cocoa butter, cream of wheat and peanut butter have to change their names as well?In recent years, dairy milk alternatives made from almonds, soy, cashews and coconuts have exploded in popularity. Many people consider them more nutritious than cow’s milk. Some people buy them because they have a milk allergy or lactose intolerance. Others choose them for environmental reasons or because they want a vegan diet. And some just like the taste.Cow’s milk was once one of America’s most iconic beverages. But Americans are drinking less of it. Americans drink 37 percent less milk today than they did in 1970, according to the Department of Agriculture. Dairy milk sales tumbled to $12 billion last year, down 20 percent from $15 billion in 2011. Part of the reason is that people switched to other beverages, such as soft drinks, fruit juices, bottled water and soy and almond milk. Mintel, a market research firm, found that negative health perceptions were driving the decline in sales of cow’s milk.Plant-based milks, with brand names like Almond Breeze and Silk, are sold in the dairy aisle and still represent a fraction of the beverage market, but they are growing in popularity. According to Nielsen, sales of plant-based milks have surged to $1.4 billion from $900 million in 2012.Much of the growth in plant-based milk has come from the rising popularity of almond milk. Last year, Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee chain, announced that it would begin offering almond milk to lighten its espresso drinks, to meet customer demand. The chain said it was one of the most-requested customer suggestions of all time.Experts say sales of almond milk are surging for a number of reasons. The dairy industry has come under fire over concerns about animal welfare and the environmental impact of livestock, which contributes to air and water pollution. Almond production has an environmental impact as well: Most of the world’s almonds come from drought-stricken California, where farmers have been accused of diverting dwindling groundwater reserves to their almond orchards, and producing just 16 almonds requires an estimated 15.3 gallons of water. But ultimately the environmental impact of producing cow’s milk in areas where almonds are grown would be far worse, said David Zetland, an assistant professor of economics at Leiden University College in the Netherlands and the author of “Living With Water Scarcity.”Many consumers also consider almond milk a healthier alternative to cow’s milk. The dairy industry says that’s not true. They point out that milk has nine essential nutrients that are necessary for good health, like calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12 and potassium. The industry has also created ads claiming that milk has up to eight times as much protein as almond milk and fewer ingredients and additives. Some brands of soy and almond milk do contain large amounts of added sugar. But they also come in unsweetened varieties with zero sugar, and some are fortified with calcium, B12 and other nutrients.There is also debate over the nutritional merits of cow’s milk. In 2013, for example, two of the country’s top nutrition experts, Walter Willett and David Ludwig, both at Harvard, published an editorial in JAMA Pediatrics arguing that healthy adults who get plenty of vegetables, nuts and protein in their diets may not get any extra benefit from cow’s milk. They also raised concerns about exposure to hormones in milk and high levels of added sugar in the chocolate milk served in many schools.As the dairy industry continues to press its case, producers of nondairy milks are fighting back. The Plant Based Foods Association sent letters to the F.D.A. stating that plant-based milks were properly labeled with their “common or usual” names. A petition from the Good Food Institute opposing the dairy labeling legislation has garnered more than 41,000 signatures.“Don’t they have better things to do than to care about what a product is called?” asked Miyoko Schinner, the chief executive of Miyoko’s Kitchen, which sells popular nut-based cheeses and butters at almost 2,000 stores nationwide. “The only reason they would care is because they’re protecting their special interests.”Marsha Cohen, an expert on food and drug law at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, said that the dairy industry faces an uphill battle. She said the government’s definitions for milk and other foods — known as “standards of identity” — are intended primarily to protect consumers from financial harm, such as being duped into buying cheap or imitation foods masquerading as more expensive ones. She noted that the F.D.A. recently allowed the company Hampton Creek to call its vegan mayonnaise substitute “Just Mayo,” even though the F.D.A.’s legal definition of mayonnaise states that the condiment must contain eggs.The debate over what can and can’t be called milk already has played out in courts, with judges so far siding with the plant-based milk industry. In 2013, Judge Samuel Conti of Federal District Court in San Francisco, dismissed a proposed class-action lawsuit that claimed that almond, coconut and soy milk were mislabeled because they do not come from cows. Judge Conti said the claim “stretches the bounds of credulity,” and that it was “simply implausible that a reasonable consumer would mistake a product like soy milk or almond milk with dairy milk from a cow.” He said the lawsuit was reminiscent of an earlier case in which a woman claimed she was misled by Cap’n Crunch’s Crunch Berries cereal because she thought it contained real fruit (that case was thrown out).In another lawsuit in 2015, another Federal District Court judge in California, Vince Chhabria, rejected a similar claim that consumers could be misled into thinking that soy milk and cow’s milk were nutritionally equivalent.“A reasonable consumer,” he wrote, “would not assume that two distinct products have the same nutritional content; if the consumer cared about the nutritional content, she would consult the label.”One place the dairy industry has always found support is in Washington. The industry has spent millions of dollars lobbying the federal government, which strongly encourages Americans to drink plenty of milk. The government’s dietary guidelines recommend that Americans consume up to three cups of low-fat milk or dairy products each day, saying it contains many essential nutrients such as protein, calcium, vitamin D and potassium.Senator Baldwin of Wisconsin said that one of the reasons she introduced the Dairy Pride Act was that her dairy-farmer constituents wrote to her with their concerns. Among those was Janet Clark, a third-generation dairy farmer who runs Vision Aire Farms about 80 miles north of Milwaukee. Ms. Clark said that she and her family have struggled as milk prices have slumped and the costs of operating their farm have risen. She says that plant-based products are unfairly profiting from the name and reputation of cow’s milk.“We set a high standard for the milk we produce,” she said. “Milk has already been defined as coming from a dairy animal. We just want that to be enforced in the marketing in supermarkets — that what is being called milk comes from a dairy animal.”"
Blood Pressure? 120 May Be a Good Target,"Lowering blood pressure to 120 — instead of the current guideline of 140, or even higher for older people — could prevent more than 100,000 deaths a year in the United States alone, researchers report.The projections are based on earlier findings from the Sprint study, an analysis of more than 9,300 people age 50 and older that found that intensive blood pressure treatment could be lifesaving for adults at high risk for cardiovascular disease.For this new analysis, in Circulation, scientists used data on a broad sampling of 2,185 men and women 50 or older at high risk for heart disease. They followed them from 1999 through 2011, tracking their blood pressure and their use of antihypertensive medicines.The researchers calculated that nationwide implementation of such treatment could result in 107,500 fewer deaths annually. But driving blood pressure that low might require using three or even four blood pressure drugs, resulting in more side effects, some potentially serious, including fainting from low blood pressure, electrolyte imbalances and kidney injury.The lead author, Adam Bress, of the University of Utah, said that intensive treatment could still be worth the trade-off. “I think it’s worth a conversation, and then a try if you’re willing,” he said. “But it may not be right for everyone.”To find out more about the best home blood pressure monitors, check out the advice at The Sweethome, a product recommendation site owned by the New York Times."
A Contentious List of Finalists for Global Aid Fund Group’s Director,"Three candidates to become the next director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria are likely to draw harsh scrutiny from the fund’s largest donor, the United States.The nominating committee of the fund’s board on Monday produced a report naming the three finalists and its rationale for picking them. A copy of the report was made available to The New York Times.While all might have been considered excellent candidates for the job in earlier years, global health officials are worried that their backgrounds could push the Trump administration away from historical commitments to the fund.One candidate, in particular, has used Twitter posts to call Mr. Trump a fascist, saying he has much in common with ISIS for his anti-Muslim stance.A spokesman for the Global Fund said on Wednesday that it considered all three candidates “skilled and highly experienced,” that none would be asked to withdraw and the election would proceed as scheduled on Feb. 27. The four-year term of Dr. Mark Dybul, the current executive director, ends on May 31.A senior United States government official said administration global health officials received the three candidates’ names Monday evening and had not yet met to discuss them.The fund, which estimates that it has saved 20 million lives since it was founded in 2002, is well respected. In December, Britain’s foreign aid agency gave it top grades on a “value for money” assessment of 38 aid organizations to which it donates.But the fund has long struggled to raise money. It was originally hoped that donors would commit $10 billion a year. Instead, it gets less than $5 billion.The United States has always donated a third of the fund’s budget and is by far its greatest source of support.The finalists, selected from a preliminary list of nine, are: Dr. Muhammad Ali Pate, a former health minister of Nigeria; Subhanu Saxena, a drug executive who in August stepped down as chief executive of Cipla, a major Indian pharmaceutical company; and Helen Clark, a former prime minister of New Zealand who ran the United Nations Development Program.Dr. Pate, a former World Bank health specialist, is a visiting scholar at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health. He has held several Nigerian government jobs, including health minister, for which he was praised for improving primary care, training midwives to cut maternal and child mortality, and fighting polio.The nominating committee’s report noted misuse of funds at one health agency run by Dr. Pate, but said there was “no suggestion of impropriety on his part” and that anticorruption measures he had put in place were not followed after he left.In July, however, Dr. Pate posted on Twitter a New Yorker article called “Being Honest About Trump,” including this summary, “To call the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee a fascist of some variety is simply to use a historical label that fits.”In December 2015, Dr. Pate, a Muslim, shared a series of articles on Twitter critical of Mr. Trump’s call to ban Muslims.. He shared an article that noted condemnation of Mr. Trump’s call by British and French leaders in The Washington Post.Another post, using a headline with a column in Time by Kareem Kareem Abdul Jabbar, the retired basketball star, said “Donald Trump has more in common with ISIS than America.”Mr. Saxena is a business executive brought up in Britain. He worked for Citicorp, ran PepsiCo operations in Africa and Russia, and was a longtime executive for Novartis, a pharmaceutical conglomerate with headquarters in Switzerland.He was responsible for increasing production of CoArtem, a malaria drug that is a mainstay of the Global Fund and the President’s Malaria Initiative, begun by President George W. Bush’s administration.From 2013 to 2016, he was chief executive of Cipla, the Indian drug company that is one of the Global Fund’s biggest suppliers. He stepped down in August, citing “family priorities.”The report noted that, although he was a businessman, he had worked with governments, regulators and medical charities like Doctors Without Borders.Yet American officials may look askance at the hiring of an executive from a large pharmaceutical company for whom the Global Fund has been a major customer. By 2015, six million Africans were receiving antiretroviral drugs made by Cipla.Ms. Clark was elected to New Zealand’s Parliament in 1981 and was prime minister from 1999 to 2008. She became the administrator of the United Nations Development Program in 2009 and was, according to the report, “a reformer, driving much greater organizational efficiency and a major decentralization.”The Trump administration has expressed hostility toward United Nations programs. Internal memos obtained by The New York Times show the new administration has considered cutting its support for United Nations’ international operations by at least 40 percent.Yet the development program has never been a particular target of American conservatives, who tend to criticize the United Nations cultural organization, population planning agency and peacekeeping operations.Several people familiar with the fund’s search for a director expressed dismay over the choices, worrying that each might jeopardize support from the United States, but none would speak for attribution. One described himself as distressed; another worried that the candidates had not been adequately vetted.Seth Faison, a spokesman for the fund, argued that no candidate should withdraw.“Lots of people said things about Trump during the campaign that now are working with him,” he said of Dr. Pate.Of Mr. Saxena and Ms. Clark, he said, United Nations connections and business connections were unavoidable in virtually any candidate not from a major donor country. The director does not oversee buying from drug companies, he said, and the fund gives money to many recipients, including $300 million to United Nations Development Program and $800 million to Nigeria.“Anyone who ever worked in any government that got funds from the Global Fund would be off limits, which is not realistic,” he said.A director could recuse himself from decisions with potential conflicts, he said, and a different fund representative could approach the United States during the next appeal for donations, which typically occur at three-year intervals."
Work Stops at C.D.C.’s Top Deadly Germ Lab Over Air Hose Safety,"Work at the high-security government lab that handles deadly pathogens like the Ebola virus has been suspended since Feb. 16, when it was discovered that nylon hoses used to pump air into the scientists’ protective suits had not been designed or tested for breathing safety, officials said on Friday. The hoses have been in use since 2005.The problem, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, involved about 100 lab workers, said Steve Monroe, the associate director for Laboratory Science and Safety there. But there is no evidence that anyone has become ill as a result, he said. There is no risk to the public.The hoses are used with protective gear that looks like a spacesuit, fully enclosing the wearer and providing its own air supply to avoid any possible contact with pathogens, some of which may be airborne.The potential worry is not that germs could have invaded the air the workers were breathing, but that chemicals released into the air supply from the hose material might have been unsafe to breathe. Air samples from the hoses are being tested to see if any harmful chemicals are present. Results are expected next week.Dr. Monroe said nylon was a stable compound, and he did not expect that anything of concern would be found.Widely publicized accidents in recent years at the disease centers and other government labs, involving germs that cause influenza, anthrax and smallpox, have led to efforts to tighten procedures and reporting of mistakes. The discovery and response of this latest problem shows that the C.D.C. is succeeding, Dr. Monroe said, “in our ongoing efforts to improve accountability for lab safety and empower staff to report things that come to their attention.”Ebola experiments had been underway in the lab that is now closed, he said.New hoses were expected to arrive Friday night, Dr. Monroe said, adding that they were certified for breathing, but that he did not know what they were made of. Work will resume once the hoses are installed.He said scientists who worked in the lab expressed some health concerns when they were told about the hoses, but were eager to get back to work.The problem came to light when the C.D.C. ordered new hoses to replace the original ones, which had been installed when the laboratory opened in 2005. The manufacturer — the same one that had provided the original hoses — informed the C.D.C. that its products were not meant for breathing. Dr. Monroe declined to name the company.Why the unsuitability of the hoses was not recognized in 2005 is not clear, Dr. Monroe said, adding that he did not know whether the disclaimer about breathing was something that the company adopted after 2005. But he said there was no indication that the company had any knowledge or concerns about the presence of anything toxic in the hoses.The hoses were meant to carry compressed air for industrial tools like nail guns and paint sprayers, Dr. Monroe said. They did not come with the fitting needed to attach them to the protective suits worn in germ labs. In theory, that mismatch could have been a warning sign: Medical equipment is often manufactured with unique fittings and nozzles so that pieces that do not belong together cannot be joined. The same principle is used at gas stations, where the nozzle for diesel fuel often will not fit into a gasoline tank.But in the C.D.C. case, instead of looking for hoses created to fit the suits, the lab designer found a manufacturer that could make fittings that would let the industrial hoses hook up with the suits."
"Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast?","There is a crisis brewing in the cosmos, or perhaps in the community of cosmologists. The universe seems to be expanding too fast, some astronomers say.Recent measurements of the distances and velocities of faraway galaxies don’t agree with a hard-won “standard model” of the cosmos that has prevailed for the past two decades.The latest result shows a 9 percent discrepancy in the value of a long-sought number called the Hubble constant, which describes how fast the universe is expanding. But in a measure of how precise cosmologists think their science has become, this small mismatch has fostered a debate about just how well we know the cosmos.“If it is real, we will learn new physics,” said Wendy Freedman of the University of Chicago, who has spent most of her career charting the size and growth of the universe.The Hubble constant, named after Edwin Hubble, the Mount Wilson and Carnegie Observatories astronomer who discovered that the universe is expanding, has ever given astronomers fits. In an expanding universe, the farther something is away from you, the faster it is receding. Hubble’s constant tells by how much.But measuring it requires divining the distances of lights in the sky — stars and even whole galaxies that we can never visit or recreate in the lab. The strategy since Hubble’s day has been to find so-called standard candles, stars or whole galaxies whose distances can be calculated by how bright they look from Earth.But the calibrators themselves need to be calibrated, which has led to a rickety chain of assumptions and measurements in which small errors and disagreements — about, say, how much dust is interfering with observations — can build up to cosmic proportions. Only three decades ago, renowned astronomers could not agree on whether the universe was 10 billion or 20 billion years old. Now everybody has settled on its age as about 13.8 billion years.Using a new generation of instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have steadily whittled down the uncertainty in the Hubble constant.In 2001, a team led by Dr. Freedman reported a value of 72 kilometers per second per megaparsec (about 3.3 million lightyears), in the galumphing units astronomers prefer. It meant that for every 3.3 million lightyears a galaxy was farther away from us, it was moving 72 kilometers a second faster.Hubble’s original estimate was much higher, at 500 in the same units of measurement.Dr. Freedman’s result had an error margin that left it happily consistent with other more indirect calculations, that had gotten a slightly slower and lower value of 67 for the Hubble constant. Those were derived from studies of microwaves emitted and still lingering in the sky from the the primordial Big Bang fireball.As a result, in recent years, astronomers have settled on a recipe for the universe that is as black and as decadent as a double dark chocolate chunk brownie. The universe consists of roughly 5 percent atomic matter by weight, 27 percent mysterious dark matter and 68 percent of the even more mysterious dark energy that is speeding up the cosmic expansion. Never mind that we don’t know exactly what all this dark stuff is. Astronomers have a good theory about how it behaves, and that has allowed them to tell a plausible story about how the universe evolved from when it was a trillionth of a second old until today.But now the Hubble precision has gotten seemingly better, and the universe might be in trouble again.Last summer a team led by Adam Riess of Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute, using the Hubble Space Telescope and the giant Keck Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii and supernova explosions as the ultimate distance markers, got a value of 73 plus or minus only 2.4 percent for the elusive constant.That made waves because it meant that, if true, the Hubble constant as observed today was now clearly incompatible with a result of the lower slower value of 67 inferred from data obtained in 2013 by the European Planck spacecraft of relic radiation from the Big Bang. The Planck mission observations that show the universe when it was only 380,000 years old are considered the gold standard of cosmology.Whether the standard cosmic recipe might now need to be modified — for example, to account for a new species of subatomic particles streaming through space from the Big Bang — depends on whom you talk to. Some say it is too soon to get excited about new physics sneaking through such a small discrepancy in a field noted for controversy. With more data and better understanding of statistical uncertainties, the discrepancy might disappear, they say.“No explanation I know of is less ugly than the problem,” Lawrence M. Krauss, a theorist at Arizona State, said.Others say this could be the beginning of something big. David Spergel, a cosmologist at Princeton and the Simons Foundation, called the discrepancy “very intriguing,” but said he was not yet convinced that this was the signature of new physics. Michael S. Turner of the University of Chicago said, “If the discrepancy is real, this could be a disruption of the current highly successful standard model of cosmology and just what the younger generation wants — a chance for big discoveries, new insights and breakthroughs.”Dr. Riess and his colleague Stefano Casertano got roughly the same answer of 73later last summer, strengthening the claim for a mismatch of Hubble constants. They used early data from the European spacecraft GAIA, which is measuring the distances of more than a billion stars by triangulation, thus allowing astronomers to skip some of the lower rungs on the distance ladder.They calculated that the odds of this mismatch being a statistical fluke were less than one part in a hundred — which might sound good in poker but not in physics, which requires odds of less than one in a million to cement a claim of a discovery.“I think it’s a potentially serious issue,” said Alex Filippenko, a University of California astronomer who is part of the team. “In this line of research the devil is in the details. And after getting the details right, we’re left with a major puzzle.”George Efstathiou, of the University of Cambridge and one of the leaders of the Planck mission responsible for its cosmological analysis, said Dr. Riess and his team had underestimated the errors in their measurement.“So, in summary, I think that the Planck results are secure,” he wrote in an email. “They,” he said, referring to the other astronomers, “may be right and we have to modify their standard model, but the evidence looks weak to me.”Dr. Riess and his colleagues have stood by their work, however, and the plot thickened further in December when a group called H0LiCOW (don’t ask) from the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany, reported its own value of 72 for the Hubble constant, also inconsistent with the Planck space mission’s analysis.Led by Sherry Suyu of Max Planck, the group measured the delays experienced by light rays from five distant flickering quasars as they followed different paths around massive galaxies on the way from Out There to us. . The technique, they say, depends only on geometry and Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity, making it independent of other assumptions about dust or the makeup of stars.Last year, a group known as BOSS, the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, came up with a Hubble constant of about 68, based on how 1.5 million galaxies were clustered in space and time, but it used data from the cosmic microwave background for calibration.There is wiggle room, Dr. Riess and others say, for both the modern and the primordial results to be right, because Planck measures the Hubble constant only indirectly as one of several parameters in the standard model of the universe. Other parameters could be tweaked.That is where new physics might come in.The most likely candidates to fill the gap, Dr. Riess said, might be a new form of the ghostly particles called neutrinos, already known to be abundant in the cosmos. They come in three types that can change into one another as they traverse space; some physicists have suggested there could be a fourth kind, called sterile neutrinos, that don’t interact with anything at all.Their discovery could unlock new realms in particle physics and perhaps shed light, so to speak, on the quest to understand the dark matter that suffuses space and provides the gravitational scaffolding for galaxies.Another possibility is that the most popular version of dark energy — known as the cosmological constant, invented by Einstein 100 years ago and then rejected as a blunder — might have to be replaced in the cosmological model by a more virulent and controversial form known as phantom energy, which could cause the universe to eventually expand so fast that even atoms would be torn apart in a Big Rip billions of years from now.“This is a very interesting tension,” Dr. Riess said. “This is why we play the game. We look for something not fitting.”He added, “Clues about the dark sector or about fundamental physics are in play.”This is the age of “precision cosmology,” and while everybody agrees that it is still too soon to tell, the avalanche of data from GAIA and the coming James Webb Space Telescope is just beginning, Dr. Freedman said. In the next few years she hopes the Hubble constant can be measured to 1 percent accuracy.“And that’s what makes it interesting — this is feasible, and a lot of work is now ongoing that will allow us to resolve this within the next couple of years,” she said. “It’s what makes me want to work on this again!”She said the situation reminded her of the late 1990s, when discrepant distances to distant supernova explosions led to the discovery that the expansion of the universe was accelerating under the influence of dark energy. Dr. Riess won a Nobel Prize for his part in that, and dark energy took its place in cosmic orthodoxy.“It’s not quite ‘déjà vu,’” he wrote in an email, “but it’s funny that whenever my colleagues and I look at the contemporary universe with our radar guns, it’s expanding too fast for the contemporary expectations!”"
When Mismatched Voices and Lips Make Your Brain Play Tricks,"The good news is, the human brain is flexible and efficient. This helps us make sense of the world. But the bad news is, the human brain is flexible and efficient. This means the brain can sometimes make mistakes.You can watch this tension play out when the brain tries to connect auditory and visual speech. It’s why we may find a poorly dubbed kung fu movie hard to believe, and why we love believing the gibberish in those Bad Lip Reading Videos on YouTube.“By dubbing speech that is reasonably consistent with the available mouth movements, we can utterly change the meaning of what the original talker was saying,” said John Magnotti, a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. “Sometimes we can detect that something is a little off, but the illusion is usually quite compelling.”In a study published Thursday in PLOS Computational Biology, Dr. Magnotti and Michael Beauchamp, also a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine, tried to pin down why our brains are susceptible to these kinds of perceptual mistakes by looking at a well-known speech illusion called the McGurk effect. By comparing mathematical models for how the brain integrates senses important in detecting speech, they found that the brain uses vision, hearing and experience when making sense of speech. If the mouth and voice are likely to come from the same person, the brain combines them; otherwise, they are kept separate.“You may think that when you’re talking to someone you’re just listening to their voice,” said Dr. Beauchamp, who led the study. “But it turns out that what their face is doing is actually profoundly influencing what you are perceiving.”The McGurk effect was discovered serendipitously when a psychologist named Harry McGurk mistakenly believed he heard the sound “da” after watching a video in which the sound “ba” was dubbed over a girl’s lips saying “ga.”Forty years later, scientists have demonstrated this effect in thousands of studies, in infants and adults, in different languages, in cases where the genders of the voice and mouth don’t match and even in cases when a person touches, instead of watches, a moving mouth.But the McGurk effect is also limited. If you close your eyes and just listen, you’ll hear “ba,” and if you watch the lips silently, you’ll hear “ga.” If you reverse the dub, you don’t integrate the sounds either. The effect accompanies only certain syllables.Why do some mouth and voice combinations produce the illusion and others do not?As we encounter people talking — voices babbling, mouths moving — our brains are constantly making calculations to help them pin down what voices belong to what mouths. The brain asks itself: “Is it likely that these two things go together or not?” Dr. Magnotti said.The McGurk effect is an instance when we mistakenly put them together.“If they’re similar enough that there is something in the middle that matches with them, then you go and put them together,” Dr. Beauchamp said. That’s how “ba” and “ga” appeared to turn into the sound “da” for Dr. McGurk.This discrepancy, where the sound “ba” and the mouth making “ga” do not equal the sound “ga” and the mouth making “ba,” exists because the brain chooses a likely voice and mouth match based on its experience with particular combinations in the past, the researchers say. The “ga” sound just doesn’t emerge from the closed lips it takes to say “ba.”“In science we’ve assumed that people do that, always put together everything,” Dr. Beauchamp said. “It turns out that might not be right.”He thinks the same decision process governing the McGurk effect causes us to put together President Trump’s lip movements with the bizarre things we hear on the soundtrack in the Bad Lip Reading video of his inauguration speech.“The idea is that in the real world, if a voice and a mouth movement are so time-locked, they would almost have to be from the same talker,” Dr. Magnotti said. “As long as they match well enough, you can still see something that makes sense.”In a complementary study published this month in The Journal of Neuroscience, Dr. Beauchamp and his student Lin Zhu determined that the brain most likely processes information about lip movements and sound in a part of the brain called the superior temporal sulcus.Knowing where or how the brain makes these mistakes may one day help clinicians understand and improve your hearing as you age, Dr. Magnotti said. For now, you can keep enjoying the funny lip-reading videos."
Lake Berryessa’s Spiraling Floodwater Mesmerizes the Locals,"There is a mysterious hole in Lake Berryessa in California. It is not a supernatural whirlpool, a demon’s mouth, or a portal into hell or a fourth dimension. The creepy thing probably won’t suck you into it either.It is just a really big drain called a spillway. And once you see it full of spiraling water, it is hard to take your eyes off it.For the first time in a decade, January and February have brought so much rain that the lake in the Napa Valley area north of San Francisco has maxed out its water capacity. To prevent flooding, this 72-foot-wide concrete funnel is sucking down the excess. Hundreds of locals have gathered to watch the show and take photos and videos since it started on Friday. And the show isn’t over. More storms are expected toward the end of the week, and the flow may continue for up to two weeks.“I went up there the other day and there were about 15 drones flying around and people taking videos,” said Kevin King, an operations manager at the Solano Irrigation District, which oversees the day-to-day activities at the dam. “It’s really dramatic to watch.”This is what happens when engineers build stuff to try to prevent dams from flooding. Recently, California’s dams have gotten a lot of attention after 180,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes because of problems with the Oroville Dam’s spillways. So far, there is no worry about flooding at Berryessa.Spillways come in many shapes and sizes. The one at Berryessa is of the “bellmouth” persuasion, which is also called a morning glory, plug hole or a glory hole, as the locals refer to it. The structure works a lot like the hole in the side of your sink or bathtub, which keeps water from spilling out onto the floor if someone leaves the faucet running. Only with a reservoir, it works when the rain won’t stop, as has been the case in this area, which has seen four wet storms known as atmospheric rivers so far this year.When water rises more than 440 feet above sea level in Lake Berryessa, it spills over the lip of the morning glory, funnels down the cone and exits into Putah Creek, on the other side of the Monticello Dam. The lake can hold about 521 billion gallons of water before needing the morning glory to prevent floods.On Tuesday, water was flowing into the hole at around two million gallons a minute, which is just a small fraction of how fast it can get.Powerful as it looks, the spillway probably wouldn’t pull you down to the netherworld if for some reason you found yourself in the lake. Although it could still be dangerous (and there are safety barriers and buoys to keep people away), you could probably swim away from the current. “It’s a lot of water, but not a lot of velocity,” Mr. King said.In the world of spillways, bellmouths like this one are uncommon, Mr. King added. Engineers pick them because they can spill a lot of water at one time and still maintain control, said Sarah McBride, a public affairs specialist at the United States Bureau of Reclamation, which owns Lake Berryessa’s morning glory. There are others spillways of this type around the world, including at the Shing Mun Reservoir in Hong Kong, Hungry Horse Dam in Montana, Nekogahora Pond in Japan and the Ladybower Reservoir in England.Although the water has risen about 30 feet since January, there is currently no danger of flooding at Lake Berryessa, according to Mr. King and Ms. McBride. But Ms. McBride urges people to stick to trails and avoid the lake’s shoreline, where mudslides and falling rocks are a concern.To see the morning glory in all its glory, park your car at the lot near Monticello Dam and walk over to see it. “You can definitely hear it as it’s cascading,” Mr. King said."
Diabetes Testing at the Dentist’s Office,"Should you get tested for diabetes at the dentist’s office?Periodontitis, a chronic gum infection characterized by swollen, tender or receding gums, can be an early warning sign of Type 2 diabetes, and dental offices could be an ideal place to screen for it, said Wijnand J. Teeuw, the first author of a new study of 313 middle-aged patients who visited a dental clinic in Amsterdam.Researchers checked them for periodontitis and also tested their blood sugar with a finger-stick blood test. Among the group were 126 patients with mild or moderate periodontitis, 78 patients with severe periodontitis and 109 with healthy gums.Nearly half of the patients with any degree of periodontitis had blood sugar tests indicating they had pre-diabetes, a condition that can progress to full-blown diabetes. Among those with mild to moderate gum disease who had never been given diabetes diagnoses, nearly 10 percent appeared to have Type 2 diabetes, while among those with the most severe gum disease who had never been given diabetes diagnoses, 18 percent had results indicating they had the full-blown disease.Among patients whose gums were healthy, 8.5 percent appeared to have diabetes, and over a third had pre-diabetes.A simple finger stick analysis “can help with early diabetes screening,” Dr. Teeuw said. The study was in BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care."
How Far to the Next Forest? A New Way to Measure Deforestation,"When the Europeans first came to North America, forests were so dense and continuous that a squirrel could have traveled from the Atlantic coast to the Mississippi without ever touching the ground, some historians say. Since then, agriculture, logging, urban development and other human activities have thinned or wiped out these once-lush forests.Scientists have long tried to estimate the extent of deforestation in North America and beyond. One of the most common ways of doing so is simply measuring the total amount of forest cover lost. But not all deforestation is created equal, said Giorgios Mountrakis, an associate professor at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry.In a paper published in PLoS One on Wednesday, Dr. Mountrakis and Sheng Yang, a graduate student, tried slicing deforestation a different way. Using satellite maps, they calculated the average distance to the nearest forest from any point in the continental United States in 1992 versus 2001. Between these years, they found, distance to the nearest forest increased by one-third of a mile.This new metric, which the researchers named “forest attrition distance,” reflects a particular type of forest loss: the removal of isolated forest patches. When these patches are lost (a process the authors refer to as attrition), adjacent forests become farther apart, potentially affecting biodiversity, soil erosion, local climate and other conditions.The authors calculated the change in total forest cover from 1992 to 2001, and found a loss of 3 percent or 35,000 square miles, approximately the size of Maine. Over the same time period, Dr. Mountrakis said, forest attrition distance increased by 14 percent, a contrast he called striking.The difference in the magnitude of these two metrics has to do with the fact that forest attrition distance takes geographic distribution into account. Two forests can each lose 25 percent of their tree cover, but have very different forest attrition distances — and different ecological outcomes — depending on the pattern of tree removal. A high forest attrition distance means tree loss has occurred in complete swaths away from other trees. A low forest attrition distance means tree loss has occurred in patches dispersed among other trees.Dr. Mountrakis says he believes that the new metric “goes beyond forest quantity,” to give a glimpse into forest quality. He hopes it will inform conservation strategies.“Isolated forest patches can have a very specific importance for biodiversity,” he said. “As birds migrate from one location to another, for instance, they can use these isolated forests as pit stops. You can think of them as oases in a desert.”He and Mr. Yang also found that forest attrition seemed to be higher in the western United States, in rural areas and on public lands, but he noted that they needed to expand their research to better understand those trends.Dr. Mountrakis’s hope is that measuring forest attrition distance can help the public better grasp deforestation. But other forest ecologists think that a new way of presenting forest loss will add only so much and that there are broader issues at play.“I don’t think we need another metric,” said Aaron Ellison, a researcher at the Harvard Forest, adding that measures of other processes like fragmentation — the breaking of large forests into smaller, disconnected forests — already provide a nuanced picture of deforestation.Decades of scientific knowledge about forest management have not managed to halt clear-cutting and unsustainable development, Dr. Ellison said. To him, the challenge is much larger, and involves altering people’s demands for short-term economic gains.“No metric, no matter how opaque or how clear, has made a difference in that discussion during my lifetime,” he said."
"In an Ancient Burial Place, 3 Centuries of One Woman’s Descendants","In a really small room in a really big house, archaeologists found the body of a 40-year-old man. They knew he was special. He was buried with a conch shell trumpet and large shells from the Pacific coast, far from this crypt in the 650-room building known as Pueblo Bonito in what is now called Chaco Canyon, in New Mexico. He was adorned with more than 11,000 beads and pendants made of turquoise and more than 3,000 made of shell. But if he was special, he was just the bottom layer.On top of him was a two-foot layer of sand, another body, wooden planks and then 12 more bodies, the bones mixed together. They were special, too. Flutes, ceremonial staffs, more turquoise, stores of ceramic vessels, remains of South American parrots and jewelry were found nearby. The elite group of 14 had been buried in the same tiny room over the course of 330 years, starting around the year 800. In a study published Tuesday in Nature Communications, scientists say they were all related to the same female ancestor, which could provide clues to the power structure of the ancient society that lived in Chaco Canyon.Starting in the ninth century, a large, complex society grew in Chaco Canyon, with small scattered settlements, grand apartments, irrigation systems and connecting roads. Since archaeologists stumbled upon these structures in the late 1800s, they’ve questioned how power was organized in Chacoan society. Was the community totally egalitarian? Did it have a single ruler? Did matrilineal family groups control ritual sources of power? Did associations of unrelated individuals, each led by the most capable, take charge?The people buried in Room 33 were clearly special, but who were they? Could they have ruled all of Chacoan culture?To find out, authors of the study carbon-dated bodies preserved at the American Museum of Natural History and analyzed the DNA preserved to varying degrees within them. They found that the bodies had been buried over the 330 years that spanned the society’s beginning to its decline — not just at the peak of its influence between the 11th and 12th century, as others had once thought. Moreover, nine bodies shared the exact mitochondrial DNA, which can be passed only through the mother. From the nucleic DNA preserved in six individuals, the researchers also discerned two direct relationships: a mother-daughter pair and a grandmother-grandson.They believe that power and influence in Chaco Canyon was hierarchical, belonged to this small group of people and was passed down through a female line between 800 and 1130 A.D. “At the center of Chaco is an elite matriline,” said Douglas J. Kennett, an archaeologist at Penn State University who was lead author on the paper.Similar to the way Jewish heritage is passed down from a mother to her children in some denominations, power in Chaco was passed down through mothers. “But this doesn’t mean that women ruled over Chaco,” Dr. Kennett said.Given that the most elaborate burials in this crypt involved males, Dr. Kennett said it was possible that both men and women held powerful positions. This equal leadership is not uncommon among some indigenous people of the Americas, said Rosemary Joyce, an archaeologist interested in inequality at the University of California, Berkeley who was not involved in the study.But other scientists saw limits to the conclusions that can be drawn from the DNA in the bodies in the crypt.“All we really know is that all of these are ultimately offspring of the same woman,” said Sarah Nelson, an archaeologist at the University of Denver who was not involved in the research, and who has studied gender and power using human remains found in China and the Korean Peninsula.“Maybe the female is seen as owning the place, or maybe she is in touch with the spirits, and maybe she can only pass that down to her daughter,” Dr. Nelson said.Dr. Joyce suggested another possible explanation. Chacoans may not have placed the two biological sexes in two distinct gender roles.“They may have recognized a spectrum of gendered ways of being that we force into two sexes,” she wrote in an email.More than a dozen large, multistory great houses speckle Chaco Canyon, and it remains unclear how far influence extended for those buried in Pueblo Bonito without examining the remains within each. And some question whether anyone was leading the whole society at all, considering the egalitarian systems of some contemporary Pueblo groups.Criticism aside, Dr. Nelson said the work was exciting: “It does begin to shed some light on the Chaco system,” she said. “It’s certainly a rare occurrence that you get that kind of opportunity to learn about the relationship of a bunch of people that are spread out through time, but all buried in the same place.”"
Doctors Consider a Last Best Hope for Obese Teenagers: Surgery,"If all goes well, Aliayha Carrasco-Garcia will have an operation next month that will change her life. She will shed many of the 240 pounds that now burden her 5-foot-2 frame. Like many who have bariatric surgery, she has tried diets and exercise to no avail. Surgery is her last best hope.But there is a difference between Aliayha and almost everyone else who has had this operation: She is only 15.While the number of adolescents who are overweight or obese has leveled off in recent years, the number who are severely obese — heavy enough to qualify for bariatric surgery — has nearly doubled from 1999 to 2014, according to national data, going from 5.2 to 10.2 percent of all adolescents aged 12 to 19. As a result, more and more doctors and parents are facing a difficult question: Should very heavy teenagers have bariatric surgery, a radical operation that is the only treatment proved to produce lasting weight loss in severely obese people?The very idea fills many parents and doctors with trepidation, and with good reason, said Aaron Kelly, a physiologist and specialist in pediatric obesity at the University of Minnesota. “We’re at a point in this field where surgery is the only thing that works for these kids but we don’t know the long term outcomes.”The best data are from two recently published small studies that so far have outcomes for just five years. Scientists say there’s an urgent need for more ambitious research.The question for teens and their parents is: Which is worse — accepting uncertainty about the long term health risks from surgery or the likelihood of serious health risks from remaining obese?An estimated three to four million adolescents are heavy enough to meet the criteria for bariatric surgery, Dr. Kelly said. But only about 1,000 teenagers a year have the operation. Many medical centers will not perform it on teenagers and many pediatricians never mention it to their heavy patients.“It obviously is a controversial area,” said Dr. Marc P. Michalsky, the surgical director at the Center for Healthy Weight & Nutrition at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio..Obesity carries serious health risks in teenagers — including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, acid reflux, fatty liver and high cholesterol levels — that tend to be eased by surgery. Added to that are social problems, including isolation and depression.Yet insurers routinely turn down teenagers on the first request, doctors say, leaving surgeons to appeal, sometimes multiple times, before they can operate on an adolescent. Dr. Kirk W. Reichard, the clinical director of pediatric surgery at the Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children where Aliayha is planning to undergo her operation, said Delaware’s Medicaid program had denied coverage for all patients under the age of 18 with one exception.When it comes to adult bariatric surgery, doctors say, insurers usually do not put up a fight. But doctors and patients often discount the option.“We still struggle with acceptance in the adult population,” said Dr. John M. Morton, the chief of bariatric and minimally invasive surgery at Stanford. “Acceptance in the pediatric community is even worse.”The two recently published studies on outcomes were encouraging, obesity experts say. One, involving 58 adolescents, was led by investigators at Children’s Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati. The other, led by researchers at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, involved 81 adolescents. Most of the participants in both studies lost at least a third of their weight and kept it off for at least five years. Diabetes often went into remission. Blood pressure readings that were high often fell to normal levels.Despite their weight loss, 63 percent of the teenagers were still severely obese after the surgery — only one reached a normal weight — and nearly half had nutritional abnormalities, including iron deficiency anemia and low levels of vitamin D and vitamin B12. Nearly half had hyperparathyroidism, a serious condition that leads to the leaching of calcium from bone.Many more could have reached a normal weight, said Dr. Thomas Inge, the director of adolescent metabolic and bariatric surgery at Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora, who led the Cincinnati study, if they had had the operation when they were younger, before they got so obese. The participants’ average age was 17 and their average body mass index was 58.5. (That corresponds to person 5 feet 4 inches tall who weighs 341 pounds.)Some researchers worry that five years may not be long enough to understand the effect of the surgery on people who undergo it as an adolescent.The operations alter brain signals that control weight and appetite and change hundreds of nerve and hormonal signals to the brain. What, researchers ask, are the consequences for still-developing brains and bones and bodies? Could low levels of vitamin D cause osteoporosis?The procedure for teenagers is the same as for adults — either a sleeve gastrectomy, in which much of the stomach is cut away to form a small pouch, or a gastric bypass in which the stomach is made smaller and part of the small intestine is rerouted. The operations are just as safe in teenagers as in adults, surgeons say: Mortality rates are around 0.1 percent, which makes them safer than gallbladder surgery or joint replacement.Both operations require patients to follow detailed medical instructions, including taking supplements for the rest of their lives after surgery. Adolescents, though, are not always the most compliant patients. Dr. Inge said that when he first started offering the surgery in 2004, several of his patients developed beriberi, a serious condition that can affect the heart and nervous system. It is caused by a lack of thiamine.The beriberi problem was solved, Dr. Inge said, after he began warning patients and insisting they take a thiamine tablet for six months after surgery. “We never saw it again,” he said.To qualify for bariatric surgery, teenage patients generally must have a body mass index of at least 40, with other medical problems like sleep apnea or diabetes, or a B.M.I. of at least 50 without related medical conditions. Bariatric surgery is the only effective weight loss option for most of these teenagers.Diets, exercise and behavioral therapy almost never solve their weight problem, said Dr. Stephen R. Daniels, pediatrician in chief at Children’s Hospital Colorado. Moreover, an obese adolescent is almost certain to become an obese adult. The grim prognosis, “debunks the wishful thinking that they will outgrow it,” Dr. Michalsky said.Of course the best option would be to prevent kids from becoming obese in the first place, but that is not so easy. There seems to be a strong genetic component that is not easily overridden. Most of the teenagers who have the surgery have a parent who also is extremely obese, said Margaret H. Zeller, a professor of pediatrics and psychologist at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital whose research focuses on adolescents with severe obesity. Dr. Morton has operated on patients from three generations in some families.But despite their qualms about possible medical problems with bones or other body systems in the future, many researchers and surgeons say those concerns are dwarfed by the consequences of being an obese teenager.“I am less concerned about osteoporosis than that their lives will be completely destroyed if they don’t get some serious weight off,” said Dr. Lee M. Kaplan, the director of the weight center at Massachusetts General Hospital. By completely destroyed, he adds, he means “medically, socially and economically.”“I’ve had many patients tell me they’d rather be dead,” than remain fat, Dr. Morton said.In almost every aspect, life for very obese teenagers is “significantly impaired,” Dr. Zeller said. These difficulties, Dr. Zeller noted, are piled onto the normal angst of adolescence.“It’s not just that people make them feel uncomfortable,” she said. The physical effort of carrying the weight around can make simple tasks arduous, like walking from one area of a high school to another or sitting at desks too small for them. Many have sleep apnea, making it difficult to stay awake in class. And, she said, “inside, they are feeling ashamed.”Although not every obese teenager feels isolated and friendless, many, including Aliayha, do. She asked to be home-schooled, but her mother, Cristina Carrasco, refused.Aliayha was not alone in wanting to leave school. Overwhelmed by their struggles, as many as 10 percent of obese students in grades eight to 12 leave the classroom and are home-schooled or take online classes instead, Dr. Zeller and her colleagues have found. That is nearly three times the rate of home schooling in the general population in those grades, according to the Department of Education.But some teenagers expect too much from the surgery. They are told they will lose a significant amount of weight, feel better and be healthier but that they are unlikely to reach a normal weight. They are told the surgery will not solve all their problems. Some, though, hold out unrealistic expectations.“They see shows about bariatric surgery or YouTube. They have this idea about the before and afters,” Dr. Zeller said. But, she added, “the average person having bariatric surgery isn’t doing a YouTube video.”Dr. Morton worries about what he calls social re-entry. “When they lose the weight, they are not always prepared,” he saidTiffany Hunter can attest to that. She had the surgery when she was 15 and weighed 350 pounds. Now, 27 and 5-foot-11, she weighs 190.“Being overweight, you think being skinny will solve all your problems,” she said. “It doesn’t. It makes new problems that you don’t know how to deal with.”She added, “You think everyone will immediately like you because of how you look on the outside.”At 15, Tiffany was not only one of the first but also one of the youngest in the country to have the surgery at the time. But some bariatric surgeons wonder if adolescents and surgeons are waiting too long.Dr. Daniels went from being shocked to hear at a meeting in 2003 that doctors were considering bariatric surgery for adolescents to wondering if a bar of a B.M.I. of 40 or 50 is too high. There was no real science behind those guidelines, he noted. He also worries about children who get fatter and fatter throughout childhood, reaching a level of obesity by adolescence that, even with surgery, will still leave them obese as they head into adulthood.Dr. Michalsky shares those concerns.“We can only expect so much out of these operations,” Dr. Michalsky said. The longer the teenagers wait for the surgery and the fatter they get, the less likely they are to reach a normal weight.But how young is too young? Should it be done on children?Dr. Morton said the only place he knows where surgeons have done bariatric surgery on children is Saudi Arabia. He and others think it is best to wait until puberty to avoid interfering with physical, mental and emotional development.But, once again, doctors are acting on hunches, they say.“We get asked very often what is the lower age limit, but we really don’t know,” Dr. Michalsky said."
‘Ring of Fire’ Solar Eclipse Will Cross Southern Hemisphere on Sunday,"Cue the Johnny Cash music. On Sunday, a “ring of fire” eclipse will blaze over parts of South America and the southern and western tips of Africa. Scientifically known as an annular eclipse, this solar phenomenon occurs when the moon moves in between the sun and the Earth but is too far away to completely block the sun as it would during a total solar eclipse.“Because you have this thin little ring around the edge of the moon where the sun pokes out, it gives it that ring of fire effect,” said C. Alex Young, a solar astrophysicist from NASA.The moon’s orbit around the Earth is elliptical, meaning that at some points it is farther away from the Earth than at others, according to Dr. Young. Annular eclipses occur when the moon is at or near its greatest distance, known as apogee.The countries with the best chance to watch the “ring of fire” burn-burn-burn include Chile and Argentina in South America as well as Angola, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa. They are along something called the path of annularity. That’s where the moon’s shadow is cast on Earth, and it varies between 18 miles and 55 miles in width as it moves. Those outside of the line will be able to see a partial solar eclipse, which looks like some galactic giant took a bite out of the sun.Sunday’s annular eclipse will begin over parts of the Pacific Ocean. It will quickly make landfall in southern Chile around 9:10 a.m. local time, and then traverse into Argentina. Sky watchers in Argentina will see approximately 97 percent of the sun covered by the moon for about a minute, according to Dr. Young.After that, the spectacle will cross the South Atlantic into Africa. It will hit parts of Angola around 4:15 p.m. local time and make appearances in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo before the sun sets. It will last for a minute and a few seconds when it crosses over these countries.If you’re not in South America, Africa or on a boat in the southern oceans, there will be a live stream from Slooh Community Observatory, a system of telescopes that observe the sky, beginning around 7 a.m. Eastern time.But if you’re in the United States, you should not experience too much fear of missing out, Dr. Young said. Come Aug. 21, you will have the opportunity to see a total solar eclipse.“There’s absolutely no comparison. While the annular eclipse is pretty exciting with its ‘ring of fire’ effect, it’s still just this bright object in the sky,” Dr. Young said. “But during the solar eclipse it’s not just what you see, it’s what you experience. The whole environment changes.”Another big difference between a total eclipse and the annular eclipse is that you cannot see the sun’s corona — its outer atmosphere that appears as white wisps of light — during an annular eclipse.“We won’t be able to see the corona because it’s just going to be swamped by the photosphere, the visible surface of the sun,” Dr. Young said. “The photosphere is a million times brighter than the corona.”He warns that the fiery ring will be very bright, so even though it will not be a total solar eclipse, you should wear a pair of eclipse glasses to watch the performance."
‘Ring of Fire’ Eclipse Travels Across South America and Africa,"People in parts of South America and Africa were treated to a rare sight on Sunday: a “ring of fire” eclipse, when the moon moves in between the Earth and the sun, briefly replacing it with a blazing, fiery ring.An event of this kind — technically called an annular eclipse — is a byproduct of the moon’s elliptical nature around the Earth, which means it is sometimes further away from the planet than at other times. An annular eclipse is one that happens when the moon is unable to completely block our view of the sun because it is at one of its greater distances from Earth.The countries with the best chance of viewing an annular eclipse are those that lie along the path of annularity, an invisible line that traces the path taken by the moon’s shadow as it moves across the globe, according to C. Alex Young, a solar astrophysicist from NASA. They include Chile and Argentina in South America and Angola, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa, where viewers were able to see the full “ring of fire” effect for roughly one minute.Skywatchers on the ground in those countries — including more than a few government agencies — live-tweeted their experience on Sunday, with some complaining that overcast weather dampened their views. People outside the direct path of annularity could still get a glimpse of the show although it was only be a partial eclipse.For everyone else, there is always the internet. Slooh Community Observatory, a system of telescopes, broadcast the eclipse online via live stream beginning around 7 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday. Americans will also get to watch an eclipse of their own soon enough. A total solar eclipse is due on Aug. 21."
"Aids for Vision Loss, From Those Who’ve Been There","In letters to The Times, blind readers reacted with heartfelt reassurance and practical guidance to Edward Hoagland’s essay, “Feeling My Way Into Blindness,” published in November.Stanley F. Wainapel, clinical director of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, admitted that “adapting to vision loss is a major challenge.” But he disputed Mr. Hoagland’s allusion to “enforced passivity,” pointing out that many advances in technology — from screen-reading software for computers to portable devices that read menus or printed letters “with a delay of only seconds” — can keep productivity, creativity and pleasure very much alive for people who can no longer see.Rabbi Michael Levy, president of Yad HaChazakah, the Jewish Disability Empowerment Center, also acknowledged that “transition to a world without sight is far from easy.” But he insisted, “Blindness does not cut me off from the world.” He cited skillful use of a cane, travel devices that tell him where he is and what is around him and periodicals available in real time by telephone among myriad other gadgets that “see” for him.Annika Ariel, a blind student double-majoring in English and political science at Amherst College, wrote that her problems are not with her blindness but rather from people’s attitudes that depict the blind as helpless and dependent. She said she travels independently, uses assistive technologies to complete her work as efficiently as others who can see, and excels academically and socially.Equally inspiring was the response of Mark Riccobono, president of the National Federation of the Blind, who became legally blind at age 5 and lost all useful vision to glaucoma at 14.“I once let blindness make me a passenger in my own life,” he wrote. “That changed when I encountered a vast network of other blind people who convinced me that blindness did not define me, who taught me nonvisual ways to handle everyday and not-so-everyday tasks, and encouraged me to expect more of myself.“I am now a successful blind man married to a blind woman, living a rich, full life with her and our three children” while heading a membership organization that helps tens of thousands of blind people. He met his wife, who was born blind, when they were both students at the University of Wisconsin.Mr. Riccobono, 40, said in an interview that he grew up trying to hide his blindness until he met people at the federation who taught him that “it was respectable to be blind” and that he could do things as effectively as sighted people do.“I’ve taught many blind people to use a chain saw,” he told me, noting that many activities that we assume require vision really don’t. For example, I knew a blind professor at Cornell University who continued to build exquisite wooden canoes for decades after losing his sight. A blind man who lived in my neighborhood volunteered at a hospital, playing piano to entertain patients.A screen-reading computer program called Jaws enables Mr. Riccobono to “read” what’s on the screen, type and send email using synthesized speech. With the KNFB Reader app on his smartphone, three clicks on the home button turns it into a reading machine that takes pictures of text — a menu, label, whatever — and reads it out to you, he said.He credited his federation with having “built the best news information source out there — the NFB Newsline, with access to hundreds of publications, breaking news, weather” that delivers information orally by telephone, on a mobile phone, on a computer via a screen reader or in Braille.He navigates using a long white cane, which he described as “one of the most elegant pieces of technology for blind people. I find things with my cane and plunk the image into a mental map of my environment.” He also uses the same GPS system available to sighted people.Mr. Riccobono emphasized the importance of being proactive before a progressive disorder destroys vision entirely. Two of his three young children have the same condition that rendered him blind, and while they can still see, they are learning to read both print and Braille.He advised me to tell my three friends who have varying stages of age-related macular degeneration to start now to learn to use the tools they will need when they can no longer see clearly. “It will make their adjustment that much easier,” he said.Of course, preparation is not possible for people who become blind suddenly through accident or disease. In a study of nine women blinded during military service, researchers from King’s College London reported that they struggled at first to adjust to vision loss, experiencing low self-esteem, social withdrawal and depression.The women were initially reluctant to ask others for help and struggled by themselves. But over time, although they occasionally felt frustrated, angry and depressed, they learned how to “cope with the challenges and limitations associated with being visually impaired,” the researchers wrote in The Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps.The American Council for the Blind has an online list of all manner of products that can smooth the way for people with limited or no vision, including information on where to buy them. Products range from voice-activated television remotes and talking calculators to sewing and kitchen aids. There are also products for people with both vision and hearing loss.Equally important is for sighted individuals to know how to interact effectively with people who are blind or visually impaired. First and foremost, be sure to identify yourself by name (and association, if your name may not immediately ring a bell). Don’t assume the person can recognize you by your voice.Don’t channel your remarks through a third person, and speak naturally. Don’t restrict your use of words like “see” or “look” when they are a logical component of a conversation. And don’t raise your voice, unless the person who can’t see also can’t hear well.Don’t assume. Always ask first if the person needs help, whether that involves crossing a street, finding a building or carrying a package. When providing directions, be specific, using words like “on the left” or “on the next corner.”"
Influential Health Fund Reboots Its Search for a Leader,"The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has announced that it is reopening its search for a new executive director.The fund is influential in global health, disbursing about $5 billion a year to fight the three diseases — a budget more than twice as large as the World Health Organization’s.The fund’s board had expected to conclude the search for a replacement for the current executive director, Dr. Mark Dybul, this week at its annual retreat. But “due to issues encountered in the recruitment process,” board members were unable to finish, the fund said in a statement.The selection process was conducted out of the public eye by a recruiting firm hired by the board’s nominating committee. On Feb. 15, The New York Times reported that the committee had named three finalists: Helen Clark, a former New Zealand prime minister; Dr. Muhammad Ali Pate, a former Nigerian health minister; and Subhanu Saxena, a former pharmaceutical executive.Dr. Pate, who was widely praised for his fight against polio in Nigeria, had a history of sharing articles on his Twitter feed that were highly unflattering to President Trump. One carried a headline referring to him as “a fascist of some variety”; another said he had “more in common with ISIS than America.”The United States contributes a third of the Global Fund’s budget, and some observers said they thought Dr. Pate’s selection might hurt efforts to attract donations. Ms. Clark, frustrated with the process, withdrew from consideration.On Feb. 20, leaders of the “implementers group” on the fund’s board, representing countries and nonprofit organizations that receive money from the fund, expressed “grave concerns” about the process because “key facts” about candidates were missed, according to a letter to the board chairman, Norbert Hauser, obtained by The Times.A majority of the implementers, the letter said, wanted the board to reopen the process, appoint a new nominating committee, hire a new recruitment agency, announce the names of candidates, hold a session at which the public could question them, and hold a town hall-style meeting at which staff members could air their views.“Public events would offer candidates a chance to show their ability to manage and respond to questions and would re-emphasize the Fund’s commitment to transparency,” the letter read.According to the rules of the process, no candidate can win without a two-thirds vote of the implementers group, along with two-thirds of the board’s “donor group.” So delay appeared inevitable.The letter by the implementers group also requested that the board create a transition committee, appoint an interim director, and manage the handover from Dr. Dybul, who is stepping down in May when his contract ends.It also asked that any senior management changes or restructuring be delayed."
"Frequent, Brisk Walks May Aid Those With Early Alzheimer’s","For some people with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease, frequent, brisk walks may help to bolster physical abilities and slow memory loss, according to one of the first studies of physical activity as an experimental treatment for dementia.But the study’s results, while encouraging, showed that improvements were modest and not universal, raising questions about just how and why exercise helps some people with dementia and not others.Alzheimer’s disease affects more than five million people in the United States and more than 35 million worldwide, a number that is expected to double within 20 years.There are currently no reliable treatments for the disease.But past studies of healthy elderly people have found relationships between regular exercise and improved memories. Physically active older people are, for instance, significantly less likely than those who are sedentary to develop mild cognitive impairment, a frequent precursor to Alzheimer’s disease.Physically fit older people also tend to have more volume in their brain’s hippocampus than do sedentary people of the same age, brain scans show. The hippocampus is the portion of the brain most intimately linked with memory function.But most of this research has examined whether exercise might prevent Alzheimer’s disease.Little has been known about whether it might change the trajectory of the disease in people who already have the condition.So for the new study, published in February in PLoS One, researchers at the University of Kansas decided to work directly with people who had previously been given a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Because the disease can affect coordination as it progresses, the researchers focused on men and women in its early stages, who were still living at home and could safely walk by themselves or perform other types of light exercise.Eventually, the researchers recruited about 70 men and women with Alzheimer’s. These volunteers visited a lab at the university, where the scientists scanned their brains and tested their memories and thinking skills, aerobic endurance, and physical abilities, such as how well they could rise from chairs, lift objects and so on.Then the volunteers were divided into two groups.One began a supervised walking program that was supposed to raise their physical fitness. They walked progressively longer and faster over the course of several weeks, until they were briskly walking for at least 150 minutes each week. In earlier experiments, the Kansas scientists had found that this routine significantly improved aerobic endurance and memory performance among older people without Alzheimer’s.The second group, serving as a control, began stretching and toning classes. These sessions were designed to be light exercise that would not increase aerobic endurance but would mimic the time commitment and social interactions of the walkers.Both groups continued their regimens for six months and then returned to the lab for repeat testing. By then, a few participants from each group had reported slight injuries and dropped out. But most had tolerated the exercise well.Encouragingly, many also now showed gains in physical functioning, particularly among the walkers. Almost all of them had significantly improved their scores on the tests of everyday physical skills.But the effects of the experiment on thinking and memory were more mixed.Most of those in the control group were now slightly less able to think clearly and remember than they had been six months before, new tests showed. The toning had not slowed the progression of their disease much, if at all.Similarly, many of the walkers performed no better and some scored worse on the cognitive tests than at the start.But some of the walkers were thinking and remembering much better now, according to their cognitive tests. These volunteers also generally showed slight increases in the size of their brain’s hippocampus, an area of the brain affected early in the course of Alzheimer’s disease, whereas the other participants did not.Trying to determine why some of the walkers showed benefits and others did not, the researchers delved more deeply into their data and found that the walkers who had increased their aerobic fitness had also improved their ability to remember and think and bulked up the volume of their brains.What surprised the scientists was how few of the walkers with Alzheimer’s had actually gained endurance. The same exercise program that previously had increased the aerobic capacity of almost every healthy, older participant now had benefits for the bodies of only a few of the walkers with Alzheimer’s.This finding suggests that “there may be physiological differences between people with and without Alzheimer’s that reach to the cellular level,” says Jill Morris, a senior scientist at the University of Kansas Alzheimer’s Disease Center, who led the study.In effect, the bodies as well as the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease may be unusual compared to those of healthy older people and may respond differently, if at all, to exercise, she says.But the potentially positive news from her study, she points out, is that when people with Alzheimer’s did gain endurance, they also generally improved their ability to think. Disease progression slowed as people’s fitness rose.“It seems likely that the right exercise programs could be disease modifying,” she says. “We just don’t know yet what the ideal exercise programs are.”She and her colleagues have studies underway and planned, however, that look at many different types and amounts of exercise among people with Alzheimer’s."
Informed Patient? Don’t Bet On It,"We want to let you in on a secret.As your oncologists, we’d like to treat you with two, or three, or four different chemotherapy drugs, each of which has distinct side effects, some of which can kill you.Or, if we were cardiothoracic surgeons, we might tell you that we need to crack your chest open to repair your damaged heart valve, and for that to happen you’ll need to undergo anesthesia from which you may never wake up.As doctors, our goal is to help you, of course, and to do no harm. But we may actually hurt you, irreversibly. Not that this happens frequently, but it might.How does that sound? Ready to take the plunge?The secret is that informed consent in health care is commonly not-so-well informed. It might be a document we ask you to sign, at the behest of our lawyers, in case we end up in court if a bad outcome happens. Unfortunately, it’s often not really about informing you.In schools, teachers determine what students know through tests and homework. The standard is not whether the teacher has explained how to add, but instead whether the student can add. If we were truly invested in whether you were informed, we’d give you a quiz, or at least ask you to repeat back to us what you heard so we could assess its accuracy. Instead, our script frequently looks more like this:There’s a sort of collusion that takes place, and we’re all complicit. Over your lifetime of seeing us, we have trained you that we will look impatient and concerned if you say you didn’t understand something or if you have a lot of questions. After all, we’re busy and have other patients to see. Shame on us.We’ve been on the receiving end of this, too. We have both undergone medical procedures ourselves for which a colleague asked us to acknowledge that we were properly informed. We said we were, fearing disappointing our doctor if we said otherwise.Unfortunately the farce of informed consent only worsens in medical research. Before you can enroll in a clinical trial of a cancer drug, we’ll hand you a 25-page document that describes the trial’s purpose, its design, the medications you’ll receive, other standard treatments, and the complications you may suffer. Oh, and we’ll tell you that you are responsible for any medical costs not covered by insurance or the trial sponsor. That’s for the lawyers, again. We will then ask you to sign the final page, acknowledging your understanding and your agreement to participate in the trial.When is the last time you read a 25-page document from beginning to end?But maybe it’s O.K. if you don’t read it. Some people don’t want to hear about potential bad outcomes. Others trust their doctors to recommend what’s best for their health, and find comfort in handing decisions about interventions like chemotherapy or heart surgery over to another. We tell our patients that if it makes their cancer journeys any easier, we will do the worrying for them.And we really do wring our hands about our decisions, and rend our garments over bad outcomes that result from our recommendations.A fundamental challenge with this process is that it is often unrealistic to think that you actually could be fully informed of what you’re about to undergo. How can we explain to you the experience of having your chest cracked open, or what it feels like when you go through chemotherapy? Neither of us has undergone heart surgery, or treatment for cancer, and we don’t kid ourselves that any depiction of the experience we provide will be enough.We’d love for you to help us do a better job of informing you, though. So here’s our request:■ Ask us to use common words and terms. If your doctor says that you’ll end up with a “simple iliac ileal conduit” or a “urostomy,” feel free to say “I don’t understand those words. Can you explain what that means?”■ Summarize back what you heard. “So I should split my birth control pills in half and take half myself and give the other half to my boyfriend?” That way, if you’ve misunderstood what we did a poor job of explaining, there will be a chance to straighten it out: “No, that’s not right. You should take the whole pill yourself.”■ Request written materials, or even pictures or videos. We all learn in different ways and at different paces, and “hard copies” of information that you can take time to absorb at home may be more helpful than the few minutes in our offices.■ Ask for best-case, worst-case, and most likely scenarios, along with the chance of each one occurring.■ Ask if you can talk to someone who has undergone the surgery, or received the chemotherapy. That person will have a different kind of understanding of what the experience was like than we do.■ Explore alternative treatment options, along with the advantages and disadvantages of each. “If I saw 10 different experts in my condition, how many would recommend the same treatment you are recommending?”■ Take notes, and bring someone else to your appointments to be your advocate, ask the questions you may be reluctant to, and be your “accessory brain,” to help process the information we are trying to convey.We’ve seen too many patients regret decisions that they made without fully understanding their options, or the possible outcome. We encourage our patients, and our colleagues, to be partners in what are often life-changing decisions about health care."
Acupuncture Can Ease Wrist Pain of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,"Acupuncture can relieve wrist pain, and researchers have tracked the brain and nervous system changes that may help explain why.Scientists randomized 80 people with mild or moderate carpal tunnel syndrome — pain caused by nerve compression at the wrist — to one of three groups. The first received acupuncture at the wrist and ankle. The second got acupuncture at the wrist alone. And the third received sham acupuncture, using “fake” needles near the affected wrist, as a placebo. Using functional M.R.I. and nerve conduction tests before and after the procedures, they measured the effect on brain and nerves.All three groups found relief from pain, but both of the true acupuncture groups showed measurable physiological improvements in pain centers in the brain and nerves, while sham acupuncture did not produce such changes. Improvement in brain measures predicted greater pain relief three months after the tests, a long-term effect that placebo did not provide. The study is in Brain.“What’s really interesting here is that we’re evaluating acupuncture using objective outcomes,” said the senior author, Vitaly Napadow, a researcher at Harvard. Sham acupuncture was good at relieving pain temporarily, he said, but true acupuncture had objective physiological — and enduring — effects.“Acupuncture is a safe, low-risk, low side-effect intervention,” he continued. “It’s perfect for a first-line approach, and it’s something patients should consider before trying more invasive procedures like surgery.”"
"Birth Defects Rise Twentyfold in Mothers With Zika, C.D.C. Says","American mothers infected with the Zika virus last year were 20 times as likely to give birth to babies with birth defects as mothers who gave birth two years before the epidemic, federal health officials said on Thursday.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded last April that Zika infection caused severe birth defects, including the abnormally small heads of microcephaly, but it had not previously estimated how common such defects were.A new study, published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, looked at several hundred pregnant women entered into the C.D.C.’s Zika Pregnancy Registry after lab tests indicated they had probably had the virus. The study compared their birth outcomes to those found in historic registries of birth defects kept in Massachusetts, North Carolina and Georgia.It found that in 2013 and 2014, those states’ typical rate of severe birth defects — including microcephaly, brain abnormalities, eye defects or central nervous system problems — was about 3 out of every 1,000 live births.By contrast, the 442 women in the pregnancy registry had 26 infants and fetuses with similar defects, which would be a rate of about 60 out of every 1,000 pregnancy outcomes, including live births, miscarriages and abortions.Comparing a rate based on live births — which is what the states tally — to a rate based on a C.D.C. tally of all pregnancy outcomes “is not a perfect comparison,” conceded Margaret A. Honein, chief of the C.D.C.’s birth defects branch and one of the study’s authors. “But the difference between three times per thousand and 60 times per thousand does give you the magnitude of the increase.”The study showed the importance of keeping birth defects registries, the C.D.C. said, and reiterated that Zika is extremely dangerous to fetuses. The agency continues to recommend that pregnant women not travel to areas with Zika.Not every American woman who had Zika is being followed in the pregnancy registry. Some who picked up the virus during travel never showed symptoms, and some were given tests that were inaccurate.In the District of Columbia, for example, tests on about 300 women are now being redone. The Washington Post reported that lab workers there misread labels and watered down test solution that was already diluted, producing false negative results. Federal officials do not think any other state or city laboratory had the same problem.Women in Puerto Rico, which had a major outbreak of the virus, are in a separate C.D.C. registry."
"First Seen 30 Years Ago, a Supernova Refuses to Be Ignored","On the morning of Feb. 23, 1987, a couple of dozen subatomic particles known as neutrinos zinged through specially instrumented underground sensors in Japan, Ohio and Russia. The particles had squirted from the core of a collapsing star 163,000 light years away in a small galaxy known as the Large Magellanic Cloud. They were the heralds of doom.On their heels, a couple of hours later came a rising blitzkrieg of light, heat, X-rays, shock waves, and rings and knots of gas and all manner of radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum — all the panoply of a star devouring itself in one of the great cataclysms of nature, a supernova explosion.SN1987A, as it is known, was the nearest supernova to be discovered since humans started using telescopes, and it sent astronomers rushing to observatories in Chile and Australia where the star was dying straight overhead. Since then, it has been studied by telescopes in space and on every continent, including Antarctica. And the show is still going on, as can be seen in new images obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope and released in honor of the event’s 30th anniversary.“There’s the shredded star in the center, the circumstellar ring that looks like a string of pearls,” Robert Kirshner, a longtime Harvard professor and currently science program director for the Moore Foundation, who has studied the supernova for 30 years, mused in an email.At its peak, SN1987A was radiating more energy than 100 million suns and was visible to the naked eye. Among other things, astronomers traced the explosion to a blue supergiant star that has now disappeared. The observations have allowed scientists to recreate the steps by which it started coming apart tens of thousands of years before the final cataclysm.The data confirmed that most of the light from the supernova was caused by the decay of radioactive cobalt produced as the star shrank catastrophically and then rebounded even more catastrophically in a thermonuclear fury.But another mystery remains. According to theory, the emission of neutrinos should have meant that the core of the doomed star was collapsing into a neutron star, a ball about the size of Manhattan but dense as an atomic nucleus, whose magnetic fields spinning and sweeping space like a lighthouse beam produce the clocklike signals known as pulsars. But there is no sign that a neutron star has been seen yet.“We’ve looked, but we don’t see any little dot in the center,” Dr. Kirshner said. Maybe it is hidden by dust, or maybe enough star material fell back onto the star to nudge it into collapsing into a black hole. The end of the story of this star is still unwritten.“The most interesting thing to test is whether we understand correctly how a star explodes and which elements it forms, by looking directly at the shredded star,” Dr. Kirshner said. “After all, you and the Earth are made of five-billion-year-old supernova debris.”"
The Secret to a Really Crisp Apple,"Q. Why are some apples mealy while others are crisp?A. “When apples are mealy, the cells split apart from each other when you bite into the fruit, whereas with crisp fruits the cells rupture and release juice,” said Susan Brown, an expert in apple breeding at Cornell University who has helped develop several varieties.The cells of crisp apples stay intact and full of juice until they are bitten into, while cell walls of mushy fruit have weakened and simply separate from each other upon pressure without providing any snap.There can be several reasons for the differences, Dr. Brown said. The genetics of the variety can influence the taste and feel, she said, with Snapdragon and Honeycrisp known for their juiciness. But often mealy fruit can come from bad handling.“If consumers store fruits at room temperature, rather than in the refrigerator, they will soften and get mealy sooner,” Dr. Brown said.The differences between varieties can be striking. One study compared the relatively new variety Honeycrisp with the Macoun and Honeygold varieties.The researchers found that the Honeycrisp fruit maintained its cell wall integrity after six months of storage, even without controlled atmosphere conditions, while cell walls of Macoun and Honeygold apples had deteriorated, releasing their juices prematurely. question@nytimes.com"
"Spring Amphibians, on the Move, Could Use Some Crossing Guards","Blood laced with a natural antifreeze pumps through the veins of wood frogs. They rest suspended, somewhere between life and death, awaiting spring’s arrival in frozen winter forests. Beneath a blanket of decaying leaves, salamanders are waiting, too.Tap, tap. It’s time for the race.Each year in late March and early April, from New Jersey to Maine, forest-dwelling amphibians like spotted salamanders and wood frogs wake up from their winter homes and migrate during the night to vernal pools for breeding. Some animals travel through the woods, never to be seen by humans, while others cross broken habitat, trying sometimes fatal journeys across streets.But some of them were waking up early late last month, the result of unseasonably warm weather, say reports from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Volunteers helping to usher the amphibians across the street in the Hudson Valley last week saw wood frogs, spotted salamanders, four-toed salamanders and spring peepers. In some pools, male wood frogs are already calling for females that show up later.When weather is warm and wet, as it has been recently and is in the forecasts for next week, hundreds to thousands of the animals migrate at once, in what’s called a “big night.”“Although our Hudson Valley volunteers didn’t witness a ‘big night’ of migration last month, we did see early movement,” said Laura Heady, a conservationist who runs a program to protect estuaries and land in the Hudson Valley for the D.E.C. and Cornell University. “We may be experiencing seasonably cold temperatures over the next few days, but the current forecast suggests next week will be rainy and warm. If these conditions prove true, I suspect more amphibians will be back on the move.”Some of these species, like spring peepers, are just traveling through the night, but others, like spotted salamanders and wood frogs, depend on the inconspicuous vernal pools, or “wicked big puddles,” as they are called in Massachusetts.The lucky ones arrive just as the ice begins to break around the edges of the pools. There, adult amphibians go through courtship, mate and fertilize eggs. Then those eggs develop into adults themselves. All of this must happen fast — before the water dries up in the summer.“It’s a race against dryness,” Ms. Heady said.In some cases, it is also a game of Frogger. Slow-moving amphibians, just waking up, don’t always make it past even light traffic, said Ms. Heady.Since 2009, more than 300 volunteers have ushered around 8,500 amphibians across the streets from just above New York City to Albany. They also counted 4,000 to 5,000 dead amphibians.Mortality estimates vary but are “surprisingly high,” sometimes reaching nearly 40 percent in New York, said James Gibbs, a biologist at State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, said in an email. “These animals are facing a major new source of mortality in many areas as it is hard to get away from roads in New York State.”People who want to help save the slippery night travelers can volunteer as crossing guards in New York and other Northeastern states. But they have to be ready to get wet, cold and slimy in the middle of the night, on a road that may or may not have any creatures to shepherd.If you volunteer, you can expect to park your car safely off the road and wear safety gear and lights to make yourself visible. Bring a flashlight or headlamp, amphibian identification guide and a data form, to record how many you see alive or dead, how long you’re there, how much distance you covered and other information, like the amount of traffic. You should wash your hands, but avoid lotion, bug spray and hand sanitizer — amphibian skin is sensitive, and you may need to pick them up or nudge them along. Those who don’t want to get close can do a windshield survey and monitor traffic instead.If weather permits next week, you could experience a big night.“It’s really incredible if you love nature and you can withstand being out in the rain,” Ms. Heady said."
"In Red-State Utah, a Surge Toward Obamacare","SALT LAKE CITY — From the moment the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, most elected officials in this sturdily Republican state have been eager to squash it.But something surprising is happening here. Despite deep uncertainty about the law’s future, Utah recorded one of the biggest increases of any state in residents who signed up for coverage under the act this year. Now, the state is seeing a surprising burst of activism against repealing the law — including from Republicans.“I’m naturally a really quiet person, but if I sit and do nothing and they take it away, how can I live with that?” asked Kim Nelson, 54, a Republican second-grade teacher who buys coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace and was recently treated for breast cancer. She has been calling and writing her congresswoman.Many Utah residents still detest the law, but the activity here, and in other politically conservative states, highlights the challenges Republicans and the White House face as they struggle to come up with a palatable replacement.When Representative Chris Stewart spoke with constituents by videoconference on Wednesday, a woman, who said she had gotten insurance for the first time in her life through the law, asked, “Poor people need it and you’re against it — why?” Congressional offices have been bombarded with calls, emails and social media messages, including from some constituents who had never been moved to contact them before.“Certainly this is something that’s unusual in Utah,” said Jason Stevenson, who is the education and communications director at the Utah Health Policy Project, a research group that has a federal grant to help people enroll in marketplace coverage. He said he had noticed a change in attitudes and energy.Concerned House and Senate aides have reached out to Mr. Stevenson’s group in recent weeks, he said, to request meetings and detailed information about enrollment trends here and how various Republican proposals, like high-risk pools for people with pre-existing medical conditions, would work. In the past, he added, “we really had to push” to get their attention.“I would say the phone calls are rattling them,” he said.Many customers of the insurance exchanges here are young, middle-class families who rely on marketplace plans because they are self-employed or students, or they cannot afford the coverage offered through their jobs, Mr. Stevenson said.Other marketplace customers, like Ms. Nelson, took jobs that do not offer health insurance because they could get coverage through the Affordable Care Act.Ms. Nelson said the option had allowed her to work at a job she loved, at a small private school. She has called and written Representative Mia Love, the Republican who represents her district, because she is afraid she will have to change jobs if the law is repealed.Catie Weimer, a record store employee in Salt Lake City who was given a diagnosis of narcolepsy after getting a subsidized marketplace plan last year, said she had joined a group called Utahns Speak Out, which she found on Facebook, as she grew increasingly anxious about the prospect of losing her insurance.Now Ms. Weimer, who is 30 and said she had voted for Hillary Clinton, is helping administer the group’s Facebook page and helped plan a “Utah Town Hall for All” last weekend. Every member of the Utah delegation was invited, but none attended.The health law is by no means perfect in Ms. Weimer’s mind; even with a subsidy, her monthly premium jumped to $95 this year, from $47, and she has a $2,500 deductible. Her insurer, Molina Health, has refused to pay for a drug, Xyrem, that helps her function, so she gets it through a charity program. Still, she said, she would have no diagnosis or access to specialists without her coverage.“I knew Orrin Hatch, but I didn’t even know the name of my other senator before this,” Ms. Weimer said, referring to Senator Mike Lee, like Mr. Hatch a Republican. She said she had called their offices repeatedly in recent weeks, adding, “The threat of something this bad wasn’t ever there before.”Many Utah voters were deeply uncomfortable with President Trump’s candidacy, though he still won the state with 45 percent of the vote compared with 27 percent for Mrs. Clinton and 21 percent for Evan McMullin, a conservative Mormon who ran as an independent.Mary Wood, a divorced mother of two who works three part-time jobs, none of which offers health insurance, said she had voted for Mr. McMullin as part of “this movement in Utah of people who had a hard time completely putting themselves behind either Trump or Hillary.” But now, she said, with Mr. Trump pushing for a repeal of the health law and for other policies she opposes, her vote is “one of the biggest regrets of my life.”She pays $75 a month for a plan that covers her family of three, receives a subsidy of $558 and worries about the type of replacement that was laid out in a draft bill recently published by Politico. That plan would provide age-based tax credits that would be most generous for older people; Ms. Wood, 39, fears it would provide her with far less financial assistance than the income-based subsidies she gets through the Affordable Care Act.“I tried to call Orrin Hatch, and his voice mail box was full,” she said. “I would have told him, ‘Look, this is going to personally affect me and my children, if you repeal the A.C.A.’”In a statement, Mr. Hatch said the law was “imploding from within,” adding, “I’ve spoken to Utahns from all over the state and from all walks of life, and the vast majority favor our efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare with patient-centered reforms that lower costs.”Although much of the support for the health law here appears rooted in Salt Lake County, which is far more liberal than most of Utah and voted for Mrs. Clinton in November, resistance to repeal also appears strong in regions where a lot of people work seasonal jobs in tourism and recreation and rely on the individual market for health coverage.“Due to pent-up demand, it was like ‘The Walking Dead’ coming out of the woodwork, seeking cures,” said Charles Kulander, an insurance broker in Moab, describing the demand for coverage after the marketplace opened in 2013.Frustration with the law in Moab, he said, is focused on the state’s refusal to expand Medicaid to adults earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level, as the health law allowed, and the fact that federal premium subsidies are available only to people earning up to 400 percent of the poverty level.As in all 19 of the states that have not expanded Medicaid, tens of thousands of people in Utah are stuck in a coverage gap, eligible for neither Medicaid nor premium assistance under the law. Many still rely on charity care offered by places like the Volunteer Care Clinic, a busy free clinic run by doctors and nurses in Provo two nights a week.Even the most conservative parts of the state have residents who have benefited from the law or know someone who has. When The New York Times asked Utah readers to share their experiences, hundreds who filled out the online questionnaire said they wanted the law to survive. Many came from Republican strongholds like Utah County, home of Provo, where only 14 percent of voters backed Mrs. Clinton last fall.A healthy minority of respondents said they opposed the law and wanted it repealed, usually citing high costs and few choices for coverage. Three insurers are participating in the marketplace here this year, but most counties have only one. Premiums for midlevel plans rose here by 20 percent on average this year, with higher increases in rural areas, but about 85 percent of marketplace customers qualify for subsidies to help with the cost, often substantially.Enrollment here grew by 12.3 percent to 197,187 this year, a time when nationwide enrollment dipped slightly, according to preliminary federal data. And the gains were not concentrated in left-leaning parts of the state: Utah County, where nearly 60 percent of voters are Republican, experienced a 26.7 percent enrollment increase through the end of December, Mr. Stevenson said, while Salt Lake County’s enrollment grew by only 2.3 percent.Still, many Utah residents buy insurance outside the marketplace and receive no subsidy, usually because their incomes are too high to qualify. Mike Robertson, who lives in Orem with his wife and three children, said he had switched plans this year to avoid a 66 percent increase in premium costs but still paid $1,200 a month for a family plan with no subsidy.“Doesn’t feel like insurance. Feels like punishment,” he said.Ms. Nelson said some of her conservative friends’ and relatives’ opposition to the law softened when they realized she was benefiting from it.“Some people have said, ‘You know, Kim, you make us feel better about A.C.A.,’” she said. “They look at me and think, ‘She used to be a runner. She never drank or smoked, but you know what, she got breast cancer.’”"
