Elizabeth Warren Turns Up the Anti-Donald Trump Volume,"Senator Elizabeth Warren delivered a scalding rebuke of Donald J. Trump on Tuesday night, describing him as a “a small, insecure, money grubber” as she escalated her feud with the presumptive Republican nominee.In a rousing speech at the Center for Popular Democracy’s annual gala in Washington, Ms. Warren embraced her role as one of Mr. Trump’s fiercest critics. She assailed him unsparingly as a heartless tax dodger cozying up with Wall Street who preyed on the misfortunes of Americans stricken by the financial crisis.“Donald Trump was drooling over the idea of a housing meltdown because it meant he could buy up a bunch more property on the cheap,” said Ms. Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts. “What kind of a man does that?”She went on to argue that Mr. Trump was rooting for people to lose their jobs and be kicked out of their houses.“I’ll tell you exactly what kind of a man does that,” Ms. Warren added. “It is a man who cares about no one but himself. A small, insecure money-grubber who doesn’t care who gets hurt so long as he makes a profit off it.”Ms. Warren’s attacks on Mr. Trump echo those leveled by Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, who has seized on comments that he made a decade ago when he suggested that the collapse of the housing market was a good investing opportunity. Ms. Warren has been a frequent critic of Mr. Trump on social media and has been increasingly taking him on in public forums.On Tuesday night, Ms. Warren also suggested that Mr. Trump pays no taxes while reaping the benefits of American public infrastructure. And she hit him for saying that he would undo the Dodd-Frank financial regulation legislation, wondering if Mr. Trump could even name three things about the law.“Donald Trump is worried about helping poor little Wall Street?” Ms. Warren said. “Let me find the world’s smallest violin to play a sad, sad song.”Calling Mr. Trump an “urgent threat” to the country, Ms. Warren painted him as someone who inherited a fortune from his father, then grew it by swindling people and skipping out on his debts.Mr. Trump has responded to charges that he sought to profit from the recession by claiming that he was doing what he was supposed to do as a successful businessman. On Wednesday, he called Ms. Warren “goofy” in a post on Twitter and said she has done less in the Senate than almost anyone else.“All talk, no action!” Mr. Trump said."
Donald Trump Dismisses National Political Director After 6 Weeks on the Job,"Donald J. Trump announced on Wednesday that Rick Wiley, whom he hired as his national political director six weeks ago, is no longer a part of the campaign.Mr. Wiley, who managed the 2016 presidential campaign of Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and has deep ties to the Republican Party, was brought in by Paul Manafort, a top Trump adviser, to help streamline the campaign’s operations in Washington.But Mr. Wiley quickly clashed with state party officials — several of whom complained directly to Mr. Trump, according to an aide.Mr. Wiley did not immediately return messages on Wednesday evening seeking comment.Mr. Wiley also clashed with Karen Giorno, who ran Mr. Trump’s operations in Florida, where he defeated Senator Marco Rubio in his home-state primary by nearly 20 points.Earlier on Wednesday, before being let go entirely — news first reported by Politico — Mr. Wiley had been stripped of his role overseeing Florida, as Bloomberg News reported.“Rick Wiley was hired on a short-term basis as a consultant until the campaign was running full steam,” the Trump campaign said in a statement. “It is now doing better than ever, we are leading in the polls, and we have many exciting events ready to go, far ahead of schedule, while Hillary continues her long, boring quest against Bernie. We would like to thank Rick for helping us during this transition period.”Mr. Wiley was one of Mr. Manafort’s first hires, and his departure adds another wrinkle to the feud between Mr. Manafort and Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager.Although the Trump campaign last week gave Mr. Manafort an elevated title, of campaign chairman and chief strategist, Mr. Wiley’s dismissal offers another sign that Mr. Lewandowski still holds sway within the Trump operation."
"Clinton-vs.-Trump Race in New Jersey Could Be Close, Poll Shows","New Jersey has backed Democrats in every presidential election since 1992, but a new poll released on Tuesday shows that the state would be in play in a matchup between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump — as long as Gov. Chris Christie is not on his ticket.A poll from Monmouth University found that 38 percent of registered voters support Mrs. Clinton and 34 percent back Mr. Trump. The survey, which had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points, found that the remaining voters would either back a third-party candidate or that they remain undecided.“Blue Jersey doesn’t appear quite so blue at this stage of the campaign, but we should keep in mind that neither major party candidate has fully locked in the support of their partisan bases,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.When that happens, Mr. Murray suggested, it could benefit Mrs. Clinton because there are more Democrats than Republicans in New Jersey.Another thing that would help Mrs. Clinton is if Mr. Trump tapped Mr. Christie as his running mate. The New Jersey governor became one of Mr. Trump’s most vocal supporters after dropping his own presidential bid, but his campaign and the time he spent away from the state took a toll on his popularity there.More than 40 percent of New Jersey voters said that they would be less likely to support Mr. Trump if Mr. Christie was on the ticket, while 8 percent said that they would be more likely to back the presumptive Republican nominee with their governor at his side. Mr. Christie would also be unhelpful when it comes to wooing undecided voters, as 51 percent of those who have yet to make up their minds said that he would be a turnoff.“Trump claims he can turn New Jersey competitive in November,” Mr. Murray said. “These results suggest he probably needs to look elsewhere for a running mate if he wants to make that a reality.”As for adding a local lawmaker to Mrs. Clinton’s ticket, the poll found that Senator Cory Booker would neither harm nor help her chances. Two-thirds of New Jersey voters said that Mr. Booker would have no influence their thinking and only 18 percent said he would be a bonus.New Jersey voters did suggest that they are open to thinking outside of the box in this election, with 11 percent of them saying that they would like to vote for an independent or third-party candidate rather than decide between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton.Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party’s nominee, and Jill Stein, a Green Party candidate, won 5 percent and 4 percent of the vote when added to the mix. Their presence on the ballot appeared to offer a small benefit to Mrs. Clinton by siphoning some support away from Mr. Trump."
"Clinton and Trump in Tight Race, Poll Shows, With Votes Split on Gender Lines","Hillary Clinton holds a small lead over Donald J. Trump nationally, according to a poll released on Wednesday that shows United States voters sharply divided along gender and party lines.The poll, by Quinnipiac University, found that 45 percent of voters supported Mrs. Clinton, while 41 percent backed Mr. Trump. When adding candidates from other parties, such as Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee, and Jill Stein of the Green Party, the race becomes a virtual tie, with Mrs. Clinton leading Mr. Trump by just two percentage points.The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.The results suggest that Republicans and Democrats are ready to line up behind their likely standard-bearers, with 86 percent of Republicans supporting Mr. Trump and 90 percent of Democrats backing Mrs. Clinton, who is still working to defeat her opponent in the primaries, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Like in many polls, Mr. Sanders performed better than Mrs. Clinton against Mr. Trump in a hypothetical matchup, leading him by nine percentage points.Gender appears to be a big factor in the likely battle between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump, with 51 percent of men backing the Manhattan businessman and 54 percent of women supporting the former secretary of state.“This is a very tight race, that will divide Democrats and Republicans, the young and the old, white, black and Hispanic voters — and husbands and wives — in the months ahead,” Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a statement.Mrs. Clinton is viewed by voters as being smarter and having higher “moral standards,” while Mr. Trump is seen as being a better leader and more inspiring. Voters also said they expected Mr. Trump to be better at creating jobs as well as tougher on the Islamic State, while Mrs. Clinton fared better on immigration and dealing with international crises."
Hispanic Official to Leave R.N.C. in Sign of Disaffection With Donald Trump,"The head of Hispanic media relations at the Republican National Committee is resigning this month in what appears to be another indication of the lingering discomfort some party officials have about working to elect Donald J. Trump president.Ruth Guerra, who is of Mexican descent and was in charge of carrying the party’s message to Hispanic voters, is joining the American Action Network, a Republican-aligned “super PAC,” she confirmed in a brief interview on Wednesday.The American Action Network is expected to spend millions on congressional races, and the new job is in essence a promotion, one co-worker said.But Ms. Guerra told colleagues this year that she was uncomfortable working for Mr. Trump, according two R.N.C. aides who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the difficulties surrounding the party’s presumptive standard-bearer.It is relatively rare for party staff members to leave the national committee in the midst of a presidential campaign unless they are going to work directly for the nominee.Ms. Guerra declined to discuss her feelings about Mr. Trump, who is deeply unpopular with Hispanic voters, but said, “I’ve had a great nearly two years at the R.N.C., and I’m excited for the new opportunities that I will have at A.A.N.”Ms. Guerra, 28, joins a handful of other R.N.C. aides who have left the party or started looking for new work since Mr. Trump became the party’s presumptive nominee.Discontent with Mr. Trump runs deep among Republican strategists and staff members, particularly with younger ones. After suggesting that Mexican migrants were drug dealers and rapists upon entering the race last year, Mr. Trump has made illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign and at times has veered more directly toward racial demagogy.Last week in San Diego, a few miles from the Mexican border, he invoked the ethnic heritage of the federal judge presiding over a class-action lawsuit filed by former Trump University students against the developer.“The judge, who happens to be, we believe, Mexican,” said Mr. Trump, about Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel, who was born in Indiana to parents of Mexican descent.In her R.N.C. job, Ms. Guerra, a Texan who speaks fluent Spanish, was a frequent guest on Spanish-language television networks. In her new job, she “will be expanding her role as a conservative voice into congressional districts across America, on both policy and political issues,” said Mike Shields, president of the American Action Network.In a profile of under-30 young Republicans last year, Ms. Guerra said her party had an opening with a community that has increasingly supported Democrats in recent presidential elections.“As a Hispanic, I know that we have an opportunity with Hispanics/Latinos — they want to hear from us and want to know that we care,” Ms. Guerra said at the time."
Clinton Campaign Condemns Protesters’ Violence at Trump Rally in California,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, condemned political violence of any kind after clashes between supporters of Donald J. Trump and protesters during the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s rally in San Jose, Calif., on Thursday night.Mr. Podesta posted a video on Twitter that appeared to show a Trump supporter being beaten by protesters outside of the event. The footage also showed supporters of Mr. Trump being chased by protesters as a “Make America Great Again” hat was set on fire.“Violence against supporters of any candidate has no place in this election,” Mr. Podesta wrote.The ugly scene is the latest example of the anger that is bubbling over in a volatile year for American politics. Mr. Trump’s trip to California in late April was marred when several of his supporters were bloodied by protesters and, in March, one of his rallies in Chicago was canceled after protesters flooded the streets.While Mr. Trump has said he does not condone violence of any kind, his campaign made little effort to condemn it.On Friday morning, Mr. Trump said his rally was full of love and enthusiasm, while lamenting that a small group of “thugs” outside burned the American flag.Mr. Trump also showed little concern about the violence as he continued his swing through California, which votes on Tuesday, with a rally in Redding on Friday afternoon. Looking past the end of the primary election season, he announced on Twitter that he will be making a foreign trip later this month.“On June 22 I will be going to Scotland to celebrate the opening of the newly renovated Trump Turnberry resort, the world’s best,” Mr. Trump said."
Donald Trump Makes His First Congressional Endorsement,"Donald J. Trump made his first congressional endorsement this weekend, backing Representative Renee Ellmers in a North Carolina primary race in which she has been opposed by heavily funded adversaries.Mr. Trump recorded a phone message for Ms. Ellmers’s campaign, calling her a “fighter.”“I need her help in Washington so we can work together to defeat ISIS, secure our border, and bring back jobs and frankly, so many other things,” Mr. Trump said, referring to the Islamic State. “And Renee knows how to do it. She gets it. And together, we will make America great again.”Ms. Ellmers is running in a redrawn congressional district against another incumbent, Representative George Holding, and a third candidate, Greg Brannon.Ms. Ellmers has been a target of conservatives for many months, and she has been opposed by Americans for Prosperity, the group affiliated with David H. and Charles G. Koch, and by the anti-tax Club for Growth.Both groups have declined to back Mr. Trump, the Republican Party’s presumptive presidential nominee."
Donald Trump Questioned About Previous Positions on Libya and Iraq,"Donald J. Trump found himself on the defensive on Sunday over his claims that he had opposed the intervention in Libya and the war in Iraq.Mr. Trump has described himself in the presidential campaign as an ardent detractor of both interventions, but his critics cite evidence to the contrary.In an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” the host, John Dickerson, pointed out that Mr. Trump had supported military intervention in Libya and the ouster of its leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, despite the fact he now criticizes Hillary Clinton on both points.“When you say supported it, I supported Libya?” Mr. Trump said.“Yes, you supported the intervention in Libya,” Mr. Dickerson replied.“I did? Where do you see that?” Mr. Trump asked.Mr. Dickerson played a video clip from 2011 of Mr. Trump saying: “Now, we should go in. We should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it and save these lives.”Mr. Trump insisted that the comments had not constituted support. “I was for doing something,” he said, “but I wasn’t for what you have right now.”The candidate also told Jake Tapper, the host of CNN’s “State of the Union,” that there was ample evidence that he had been against the Iraq war. But in an interview with the radio host Howard Stern before the invasion of 2003, the real estate developer expressed support for it.Asked in the 2002 interview whether he supported invading Iraq, Mr. Trump replied: “Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.”Mr. Trump also acknowledged that he had made “a lot of money with Qaddafi,” telling “Face the Nation” viewers that when the Libyan dictator was preparing to attend a United Nations summit meeting in 2009, he was looking for a property large enough to accommodate the Bedouin-style tent he planned to use. The Libyan leader rented a Westchester property that belonged to Mr. Trump.“He had to make a deal with me because he needed a place to stay, and he paid me a fortune, never got to stay there,” Mr. Trump said of Colonel Qaddafi. “And it became sort of a big joke. But the fact is that Libya was a disaster, from the standpoint of the way it was handled.”"
Obama’s Endorsement Leaves Hillary Clinton With a Balance to Strike,"For months, a central question of the 2016 presidential race has been how much distance Hillary Clinton needs to keep between herself and President Obama.In the last 50 years, voters have shown little interest in backing the candidate of the same party as a sitting president. (The exception is George Bush, who succeeded Ronald Reagan.)But the country has grown drastically more partisan in recent years. Mrs. Clinton is relying on support from the Obama coalition to be elected. And Mr. Obama is relying on her to continue his legacy.And so the two will make their first joint campaign appearance next week, in Wisconsin, one of a series of events they are expected to hold together.Over the course of a toxic presidential race, both Mrs. Clinton and Donald J. Trump have accrued historically high negative ratings in polls. Mr. Obama’s numbers, perhaps as a result of the vitriolic presidential race, have improved. And he hopes that his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton, announced after he held a meeting on Thursday with her rival, Bernie Sanders, will bring the Vermont senator’s supporters to her side.Still, Mrs. Clinton needs to maintain a separate political identity from Mr. Obama’s. And so, while the accelerated endorsement from Mr. Obama was welcomed by Democrats who have been urging the party to unite, the general-election campaign needs to remain Mrs. Clinton’s show."
Man Arrested at Rally Tells Authorities He Wanted to Kill Donald Trump,"A man arrested at a Donald J. Trump rally in Las Vegas on Saturday told the authorities that he had intended to kill Mr. Trump, according to a complaint filed Monday in United States District Court in Nevada.The man, Michael Steven Sandford, was arrested after trying to grab an officer’s gun from her holster, the complaint said, and had lingered near the officer, telling her he wanted Mr. Trump’s autograph.In an interview after his arrest, the complaint says, Mr. Sandford told the authorities that he “made a conscious effort to come to Las Vegas to kill Trump,” and that he had been “planning to attempt to kill Trump for about a year.” He also said that he expected to be killed by law enforcement personnel during his attempt on Mr. Trump’s life.Mr. Sandford said that the day before the rally, which was held at the Treasure Island casino, that he visited a nearby gun range to “learn how to shoot a gun” and that it was his first time using a weapon. He said he chose the specific officer because he noticed that her holster was in an “unlocked position.”Mr. Sandford had a United Kingdom driver’s license when he was arrested and had been living in New Jersey for about a year and a half before driving to California, and eventually Las Vegas He said he had bought a ticket to Mr. Trump’s rally in Phoenix later that day as a backup plan should he not find an opportunity in Las Vegas.All rallies for Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, are protected by the Secret Service and feature full metal scanners at the entrance, along with numerous members of his private security detail throughout the events.The Trump campaign directed all requests for comment to the Secret Service.In an email, a spokeswoman for the Secret Service confirmed that Mr. Sandford was arrested after trying to disarm the officer. She said that the investigation was continuing and that he could face additional charges."
Hillary Clinton’s Speech: What You Missed,"COLUMBUS, Ohio — Hillary Clinton disparaged the economic record and policy acumen of Donald J. Trump in a speech on Tuesday, suggesting his ideas were ill-considered and scrutinizing his own checkered business history. Some of the highlights:• Mrs. Clinton said the American economy “isn’t yet where we want it to be, but we are stronger and better positioned than anyone in the world.” She trumpeted her fiscal record as a senator from New York.• She said that, like Mr. Trump’s foreign policy ideas, his economic proposals were dangerous. “Just like he shouldn’t have his finger on the button, he shouldn’t have his hands on our economy,” Mrs. Clinton said.• Mrs. Clinton cited a series of Mr. Trump’s past controversial comments about issues like the minimum wage. She said Mr. Trump had also “said all kinds of things about women in the workforce. He once called pregnant employees — and I quote — ‘an inconvenience.’”• Mrs. Clinton, who has often been criticized for her ties to Wall Street, suggested Mr. Trump would “take us back to where we were before the crisis” and “rig the economy for Wall Street again.” She also assailed Mr. Trump’s comments appraising himself as the “king of debt.”• Predicting that Mr. Trump would cause a recession, Mrs. Clinton noted that the global economy “hangs on every word our president says.” She said Mr. Trump’s suggesting that the United States might default on its debt could start “a global panic” if he were president.• Mrs. Clinton described the process of constructing her speech: “I had my researchers and my speech writers send me information” on Mr. Trump “and then I’d say, ‘Really? He really said that?’ And they’d send me all the background and the video clip.”• Observing that Mr. Trump had not released his tax returns, Mrs. Clinton speculated that he might be “afraid” of voters seeing what they would reveal. “Maybe he isn’t as rich as he claims,” she said.• As Mr. Trump posted on Twitter to counter Mrs. Clinton’s remarks, she ticked off a list of foreign countries where Trump-branded products had been made.• The crowd laughed when Mrs. Clinton discussed Mr. Trump’s record with casinos in Atlantic City and the bankruptcies of his companies. She said Mr. Trump had “written a lot of books about business” and added, “They all seem to end at Chapter 11.”• Mrs. Clinton raised the controversy surrounding Trump University, which has been sued for fraud. “This is his one move. He makes over-the-top promises,” she said, “then everything falls apart and people get hurt.”• Invoking her deceased father’s small business, Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump had refused to pay contractors for work they had completed. “So I take this personally,” she said.• Wrapping a 45-minute speech, Mrs. Clinton reiterated a campaign theme — “Stronger Together”— and argued that Mr. Trump “believes in the worst of us.” As she spoke, the Trump campaign sent news releases to reporters raising questions about Mrs. Clinton’s conduct and judgment."
Donald Trump Rebukes Ruth Bader Ginsburg for Deriding His Candidacy,"Donald J. Trump on Tuesday assailed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the Supreme Court for speaking out on the presidential race, calling her disdainful remarks about his candidacy “highly inappropriate” and suggesting that she owed other justices an apology.Mr. Trump’s remarks came in a telephone interview with The Times two days after Justice Ginsburg was quoted as saying she was frightened about what the nation would look like if he were elected.“I can’t imagine what this place would be — I can’t imagine what the country would be — with Donald Trump as our president,” Justice Ginsburg told The Times in an interview published Sunday. “For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be — I don’t even want to contemplate that.” She even joked ruefully about moving to New Zealand.Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, said he found those remarks unbefitting a member of the high court.“I think it’s highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign, frankly,” Mr. Trump said. “I think it’s a disgrace to the court and I think she should apologize to the court. I couldn’t believe it when I saw it.”He continued: “That she should be saying that? It’s so beneath the court for her to be making statements like that. It only energizes my base even more. And I would hope that she would get off the court as soon as possible.”Mr. Trump also said he expected to announce his choice of a running mate by Friday, winding down a process that has been closely watched as in all likelihood the most significant decision he will make in his campaign.“I have five candidates, plus two, two that are unknown to anybody,” Mr. Trump said from Chicago, where he was raising money for his campaign.“I will be making a decision over the next three- to four-day period of time, and I think it will be a decision that will be a very good decision for a lot of people,” he added.Mr. Trump said that he was not basing his vice-presidential selection on fund-raising prowess or potential, and indicated that he had had enough experience with many of those he has been considering for the job that their tryouts on the campaign trail would not necessarily be determinative.“I’ve been with these people for a long time — I know them,” Mr. Trump said, specifically invoking Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. “Christie was excellent yesterday and Newt is excellent.” Mr. Trump will appear on Tuesday night in Indiana with Gov. Mike Pence, who has risen in the estimation of many of the nominee’s advisers.Mr. Trump said his decision was largely coming down to instinct. “A lot of is gut. A lot of it is,” he said. “My whole life has been about gut.”He also suggested that he would consider polling in states like heavily Democratic Connecticut, which he again said he believed he could put in play in November.Asked for quick thoughts about each of the candidates he is known to be considering, Mr. Trump played along.Governor Christie? “Strong,” he said.Retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn? “A patriot.”Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa? “A terrific, exciting person.”Governor Pence? “Solid as a rock.”And Mr. Gingrich? “Newt is Newt. He’s a good guy.”"
Polls in 3 Crucial States Show Donald Trump Improving,"Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump are deadlocked in the crucial swing states of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida, according to new polls showing the presumptive Republican presidential nominee gaining strength on his Democratic rival because of doubts about her honesty.Surveys from Quinnipiac University show the two candidates statistically tied in the states going into their party conventions in Cleveland and Philadelphia this month. Mr. Trump leads Mrs. Clinton in Florida by three percentage points, 42 percent to 39 percent. In Pennsylvania, he is ahead by two points, 43 percent to 41 percent. And in Ohio they are tied, with each having support of 41 percent of voters.When Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party nominee, and Jill Stein, the Green Party’s candidate, are included in the polls, Mr. Trump does even better, leading Mrs. Clinton by five points in Florida, six points in Pennsylvania and one point in Ohio. Mr. Johnson is expected to be on ballots in all 50 states.The polls, which have margins of error of plus or minus three percentage points, show improvement for Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania and Florida, where he is starting to do better with women and independent voters while gaining more support among men. In June, Mrs. Clinton held small leads over Mr. Trump in Florida and Pennsylvania and they were tied in Ohio.For Mr. Trump, the polls suggest he has weathered a rough stretch of controversies and campaign upheaval. For Mrs. Clinton, the numbers could raise concern that the recent attention on her email practices as secretary of state has taken a toll. The Department of Justice has dropped the case, but several of Mrs. Clinton’s statements were disputed by the F.B.I., which said she was “extremely careless” with classified information.“While there is no definite link between Clinton’s drop in Florida and the U.S. Justice Department decision not to prosecute her for her handling of emails, she has lost ground to Trump on questions which measure moral standards and honesty,” said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll.Voters in all three states are looking for “radical change” and are unhappy with the way trade deals have affected America’s economy. While Mrs. Clinton is viewed as being more prepared to be president, Mr. Trump is seen as the more honest candidate and better suited to fight terrorism.Despite the progress, Mr. Trump continues to struggle in some areas. For instance, in Florida, which has a large Hispanic population, he is winning only 21 percent of nonwhite voters.But he is also making progress with other important voting blocs. Mr. Trump has struggled with female voters in many national polls, but in Pennsylvania he has narrowed the gender gap. He currently trails Mrs. Clinton by just four points, down from 16 points in June.Both candidates are expected to campaign aggressively in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida ahead of the November election. No candidate has won the presidency without winning two of those three states since 1960, Quinnipiac notes.“Donald Trump enters the Republican convention on a small roll in the three most important swing states in the country,” Mr. Brown said.Separate polls released on Wednesday by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist also showed Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton statistically tied in Ohio and Iowa. In Pennsylvania, Mrs. Clinton holds a solid advantage, topping Mr. Trump by nine percentage points, 45 percent to 36 percent.As with the Quinnipiac polls, the surveys show Mr. Trump gaining ground in the last month."
Republican Convention Night 2: What You Missed,"CLEVELAND — Donald J. Trump is officially the Republican presidential nominee  and tonight’s focus at the Republican National Convention — ostensibly, at least — was on jobs and the economy.The highlights:• Mr. Trump showed up — virtually, from New York, on a Jumbotron to unofficially accept the nomination at little after 9 p.m. But for him, it was both a bit of a wooden and constrained appearance.He watched on TV as his children helped put him over the top, he said, but gave little of substance, without mentioning Hillary Clinton._____• For a guy who was passed over for the vice-presidential nomination, and seemed to be kicked around by the Trump campaign at every turn, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey was the star of the second night.For about 15 minutes, he laid out one short indictment of Mrs. Clinton after another, asking after each, “Guilty or not guilty?” It was part red meat, part courtroom procedural, and with each query, “GUILTY!” resonated through the hall, interrupted only by an occasional “Lock her up!” (We fact-checked his remarks.)_____• For several painful minutes, Paul Ryan, the House speaker, name-checked Mr. Trump, always linking him to Mike Pence, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, and he acknowledged, with some understatement, that “we Republicans have had our differences this year.” He focused on skewering Mrs. Clinton. Fact Check: He said poverty has gotten worse during the almost eight years of the Obama administration. In fact, the poverty rate did increase in 2009, after he took office, largely as a result of the economic collapse of the previous year. It increased in 2009 to 14.3 percent from 13.2 percent — largely during George W. Bush’s presidency. It peaked under Obama at about 15 percent, but fell to about 14.5 percent last year, according to the Census Bureau._____• Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who competed against Mr. Trump for the nomination, dismissed those who have said they would be willing to stomach a Clinton presidency to avoid Mr. Trump.“They’re not using their God-given brain to think about what they are saying,” he said. Rather, the election is not about Mr. Trump or any other politician, but about the people rising up “to take America back.”_____• Tiffany Trump, Mr. Trump’s youngest daughter, talked about the “sweet notes” he wrote on her childhood report cards; the looks of surprise on her friends’ faces when they would meet the real, “considerate” Mr. Trump; and a call she once received from him after the death of someone close to her.“For me, the measure of a parent is based on how they support and bolster you when you’re down.,” she said._____• Mr. Trump’s eldest son and close adviser, Donald Trump Jr., echoed earlier speakers in warning of how liberal elites had steered the country off course. But he also balanced personal lessons from his father with Mr. Trump’s familiar populist rallying cries, declaring that his father’s hard-nosed, gritty ambition would put ordinary Americans back in control._____• Maybe it was the multiple shootings over the last several weeks. But there seemed to be a muted reception for Chris Cox, the executive director of the National Rifle Association, who warned that the right to own a gun will be threatened if Mrs. Clinton was elected.This earned him at least a modest response: “A Hillary Clinton Supreme Court means your right to own a firearm is gone,” Mr. Cox said. “Make no mistake, this election is not about the next four years. It’s about the next 40 years.”"
Republican Convention Night 3: What You Missed,"All eyes were on Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana as he accepted the vice presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday, its third night, and made the case for Donald J. Trump as a Christian and a conservative. Keeping in the line of “Making America” something, the night’s theme was “Making America First Again,” and featured speeches by Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker; Eric Trump, one of Mr. Trump’s sons; and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, one of his former rivals.The highlights:• If you were waiting for the usual kind of convention speech, you just saw it. Mr. Pence, the nominee for vice president, delivered what may have been the only speech that closely resembled the typical presentation at a nominating convention. He thanked his family, introduced his wife, lauded his ticket-mate, ticked off policy ideas, made a few jokes and expressed optimism about the country and his party’s chances to win in November.“It’s change versus the status quo, and when Donald Trump is president, the change will be huge,” Mr. Pence said. He criticized Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party, describing them as “entrenched in power.” He closed out Day 3 of the convention by declaring, “We have but one choice” — to elect Donald Trump the 45th president._____• After an extended and often soaring speech focusing on notes of freedom and American conservative ideals, Mr. Cruz refused to specifically call for Mr. Trump’s election, despite repeated shouts from the crowd to endorse him, including “We want Trump!” He chided the crowd and said, “Don’t stay home in November,” but he also told them to “vote their conscience.”As Mr. Cruz wrapped up his extended remarks, Mr. Trump emerged from a side entrance, waving to the crowd. He joined his family in the V.I.P. box, as both the crowd and every television camera cut from Mr. Cruz just as he was delivering the crescendo to his remarks. He closed saying, “God bless America” on a split screen, as the cameras had shifted to Mr. Trump, who in a rare spontaneous moment at the often orchestrated conventions, stole the show from Mr. Cruz once more._____• Mr. Gingrich took the stage after a brief introduction by his wife, Callista, and attempted to clean up the non-endorsement by Mr. Cruz that sent the night into momentary chaos. Citing Mr. Cruz’s line that “you can vote your conscience,” Mr. Gingrich offered “to paraphrase Ted Cruz: if you want to protect the Constitution of the United States, the only possible choice is the Trump-Pence Republican ticket.”He then transitioned to a long list of national security failures, portraying Mr. Trump as the only candidate who can handle the foreign policy threats facing the country, before returning to a closing call for unity._____• Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a one-time Trump rival, declared that Americans should choose Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton, repeating that “America deserves better!” Mr. Walker said he had always been clear that he would support any Republican against Mrs. Clinton in the general election.Fact Check: He was never an enthusiastic Trump fan. Mr. Walker endorsed Mr. Cruz ahead of the Wisconsin primary, and later expressed disappointment that Mr. Trump would be the party’s standard-bearer. “It’s just sad in America that we have such poor choices right now,” Mr. Walker said then._____• Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another former Trump rival, once called Mr. Trump a “con man,” and worse, as he fought a bitter campaign. But on Wednesday, Mr. Rubio appeared in a brief video to concede that “the time for fighting each other is over.” The video was hardly full of enthusiasm, but he did urge voters to choose Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton._____• Eric Trump, one of Mr. Trump’s sons, offered a passionate, energetic speech on behalf of his father, describing him as the candidate who is running to make the lives of ordinary Americans better. The elder Trump sat in the audience for his son’s remarks, clapping occasionally but appearing to express displeasure as the large screen behind Eric Trump appeared to malfunction.Eric Trump said his father ran for president because he could “no longer bear witness” to America’s decline. He urged people to vote for his father, a man who “can’t be bought, sold, purchased, bribed, coerced or intimidated.”_____• Laura Ingraham, the conservative radio talk-show host, energized the crowd with verbal attacks on two targets: Mrs. Clinton and the media. Ms. Ingraham called her the “woman who helped orchestrate America’s decline,” and she drew chants of “Lock her up!” when she said that “many in public office don’t enforce or respect the rule of law — isn’t that right, Mrs. Clinton?” She called the media her “friends,” but she accused journalists of not reporting on “the phonies, the frauds and the corruption that has gone unexposed and uncovered for too long.”_____• Pam Bondi, the attorney general of Florida, emphasized “laws” in her remarks, using that theme to call attention to the fatal shooting of three police officers in Baton Rouge, La., on Sunday. She drove home her riff by saying, “now more than ever, laws that back our law enforcement. They have our backs, and Donald Trump will have your backs.”_____• Eileen Collins, the first woman to lead a space shuttle mission, may be the only speaker at the convention to appear onstage without once mentioning the Republican Party, Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama or any other politicians. Instead, on the 47th anniversary of Neil Armstrong’s walk on the moon, Ms. Collins offered a gauzy appeal for America to be a “nation of explorers.” One thing she never said: Support Mr. Trump for president._____• Mr. Trump is extremely unpopular with the Hispanic population, as numerous polls have shown, but he is not without support in the community. Ralph Alvarado, a state senator from Kentucky, took the stage to proclaim, in English and in Spanish, why Hispanics should back Mr. Trump against Mrs. Clinton.“Hispanics believe what Republicans believe,” he declared, listing off “religious liberty,” support of the Second Amendment and free speech as key examples. In Spanish, he addressed his “hermanos Hispanos,” or Hispanic brothers, saying that their families had fled countries that were plagued by corruption, and urging them to not let that corruption plague the United States."
Donald Trump Goes to Bat for Wife’s Speechwriter,"CLEVELAND — Donald J. Trump on Wednesday praised the longtime corporate employee who assumed blame for two passages in Melania Trump’s convention speech that were lifted from Michelle Obama’s 2008 Democratic National Convention address, but he conceded that the public admission should have come a day earlier.“I wanted to protect her — she’s been a person that’s been very good to me,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times, when asked if he had anything to add to the lengthy open letter from the employee, Meredith McIver, on the campaign’s website. “Absolutely. But it was getting to a point where it didn’t make sense — I mean, look at your story today.”The Times on Tuesday evening identified Ms. McIver, who works for the Trump Organization and who has worked on some of Mr. Trump’s books, as the person to whom Ms. Trump turned when she decided to shelve the bulk of a speech written for her by professional political speechwriters hired by her son-in-law, Jared Kushner.But the company and the campaign declined to elaborate on Ms. McIver’s role on Tuesday. On Wednesday, however, she said that early in the writing process she had been read those passages by Ms. Trump as examples of text that the candidate’s wife liked. Those passages were then incorporated, with some changed language, into Ms. Trump’s address, sparking a controversy that overshadowed the Monday night speech.Mr. Trump thanked Ms. McIver for coming forward.“She is terrific, she’s a terrific woman,” he said. “She’s been with us a long time, and she just made a mistake. You saw her letter. And she came in and she said, ‘Mr. Trump, I’d like to say what happened.’ I thought it was such a nice thing. Who knew this was going to be a big story?”He added: “She was more interested in getting that straightened out. Because she thought it was very unfair to Melania.”Mr. Trump said that he would not accept the resignation that she offered. But, asked if he would do anything differently in the future in the campaign for preventive measures, he pointed to other political plagiarism scandals, such as the one that sank Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s first presidential campaign in 1988.“I’ve been reading about this stuff all my life,” Mr. Trump said. “I mean it happens, it can happen.”Ms. McIver’s letter “cleared up everything,” he said, adding that “in retrospect,” as he considered the fallout, “the only thing is, if I did it a day earlier it would have been better.”"
Democratic Convention Night 2: What You Missed,"PHILADELPHIA — After a turbulent beginning to their convention, Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton for president on Tuesday, making her the first woman to lead a major party’s ticket in the United States. They then turned to hear from a lineup of speakers that included Lena Dunham, Madeleine Albright and former President Bill Clinton, the night’s main attraction.Here are the highlights:• Mr. Clinton delivered a long, personal recounting of Mrs. Clinton’s life, offering himself up as a witness to her journey from young law student to presidential nominee.“In the spring of 1971,” Mr. Clinton began, “I met a girl.”His tale stretched from their courtship to the birth of their daughter, Chelsea, and on to her time as secretary of state. He presented Mrs. Clinton as a “change maker” and contrasted his account with the way Mrs. Clinton was portrayed at last week’s Republican convention. “One is real,” he said. “The other is made up.”_____• Following Mr. Clinton, Meryl Streep, the award-winning actress, put a cap on the night’s march through Mrs. Clinton’s career by situating her within the arc of women who have broken down barriers in American public life. “How does she do it? That’s what I want to know,” she said. “Where does she get her grit and her grace? Where do any of our female firsts, our path-breakers, where do they find that strength?”_____• At the end of the night, Mrs. Clinton appeared live on screen to address the convention. “What an incredible honor that you have given me,” she said, “and I can’t believe we just put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet.”“If there are any little girls out there who stayed up late to watch,” she added, “let me just say, I may become the first woman president, but one of you is next.”_____• Madeleine Albright, who served as secretary of state under Mr. Clinton and was the first woman to hold the job, delivered a blistering criticism of Donald J. Trump’s foreign policy credentials. “The truth is that a Trump victory in November would be a gift to Vladimir Putin,” she said.In Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Albright said, she sees Harry S. Truman’s “fighting spirit” as well as someone who has been tested. “We also know what it’s like to step off that plane with the words ‘United States of America’ on it,” Ms. Albright said. “She knows that safeguarding freedom and security is not like hosting a TV reality show.”_____• Mrs. Clinton has drawn support from the “Mothers of the Movement,” a group that includes the mothers of black people killed by gun violence or in incidents involving the police, like Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner. In an emotional moment, three mothers who had lost children addressed the convention, while others stood with them on stage.“I am here with Hillary Clinton tonight because she is a leader and a mother who will say our children’s names,” said Geneva Reed-Veal, the mother of Sandra Bland. “She knows that when a young black life is cut short, it’s not just a loss. It’s a personal loss. It’s a national loss. It’s a loss that diminishes all of us.”_____• The actresses Lena Dunham and America Ferrera used Mr. Trump’s own words against him.“Hi, I’m Lena Dunham, and according to Donald Trump, my body is probably like a two.”“And I’m America Ferrera, and according to Donald Trump, I’m probably a rapist.”Despite Mr. Trump’s messages to the contrary, they said, the country’s differences are not bigger than what unites it. Not only that, Ms. Ferrera said, but “the vast majority of us, we cannot afford to see his vision of America come to be.”_____• It was one of the Republican convention’s most talked-about moments: Mr. Trump’s WWE-style entrance into the arena to introduce his wife. Elizabeth Banks, the actress, director and host of the evening, gave the Democrats a spoof of it. As Queen’s “We Are the Champions” filled the convention hall, Ms. Banks, backlit, sauntered onto the stage, slowly clapping.“The Trump campaign is so hard up for money,” she continued, “I just bought their fog machine on eBay for 30 bucks.”_____• Howard Dean, a former governor of Vermont and chairman of the Democratic National Committee, drew a sharp contrast between Mrs. Clinton’s “poised and persistent” fight to expand health care coverage and Mr. Trump’s plan to repeal Obamacare.And then, in a self-effacing bout of thrown arms and escalating volume, Mr. Dean reprised the “Dean Scream” made famous during his 2004 run for president.“It’s going to be won in Colorado, and in Iowa, and North Carolina, and Michigan, and Florida, and Pennsylvania, and then we’re going to the White House,” he said._____• Former President Jimmy Carter, who was treated for cancer last year and later said he was free of the disease, addressed the convention in a video message. Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, “seems to violate some of the most important moral and ethical principles on which our nation was founded,” he said. “We can and must do better.”_____• Highlighting Mr. Trump’s statements about pregnancy and women’s looks, Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, predicted that come November, “women are going to be a lot more than an inconvenience” for Mr. Trump. “Women are going to be the reason you’re not elected to be president.”"
Democratic Convention Night 3: What You Missed,"President Obama defended his legacy and laid out the ways Hillary Clinton would continue it at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday. Other speakers included Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Michael R. Bloomberg and Senator Tim Kaine, Mrs. Clinton’s running mate.The highlights (or watch live and get our real-time analysis):• Mr. Obama, in the night’s most anticipated speech, offered a defiantly optimistic assessment of America’s future and of the woman who he hopes will lead it. Even as he acknowledged “we’re not done perfecting our union,” he said that in his experience, Donald J. Trump’s vision of the country as chaotic and in decline rang hollow and would not be rewarded.“The America I know is full of courage, and optimism, and ingenuity,” Mr. Obama said, amid searing attacks on Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee. “This year, in this election, I’m asking you to join me — to reject cynicism, reject fear, to summon what’s best in us.”Mrs. Clinton shares that vision, he said, and she has been “in the arena” fighting for it for much of her life._____• With the convention floor still on its feet for Mr. Obama, Mrs. Clinton walked out on stage and warmly embraced the president. She did not make any remarks but greeted the crowd with waves._____• Mr. Kaine delivered his first major national address since joining Mrs. Clinton’s ticket, and he packed a lot in. Slipping between English and Spanish and, at times, into an impersonation of Mr. Trump, Mr. Kaine sought to sow doubt about Mr. Trump’s character and bolster Mrs. Clinton’s. Along the way, he also introduced himself to voters across the country unfamiliar with his record.“If any of you are looking for that party of Lincoln,” Mr. Kaine said in a direct appeal to dissatisfied Republicans, “we’ve got a home for you.”_____In an emotional and fiery appeal to middle-class Americans, Mr. Biden laid out a vision of an America that “always, always moves forward” on the strength of its values. Mr. Trump, he said, was not only unfit to lead such a nation through a dangerous world, but his election would be a betrayal of the nation’s values.“A man who seeks to sow division in America for his own gain and disorder around the world, a man who confuses bluster with strength — we simply cannot let that happen as Americans,” Mr. Biden said._____• Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York and a political independent who opted not to run for president, said he was addressing the convention to convey a single message: “It is an imperative that we elect Hillary Clinton the next president of the United States.”Leaning on his own business record, Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire, said he understood “the appeal of a businessman president” but that Mr. Trump was “a risky, reckless, radical choice.”_____• Leon E. Panetta, who served as both C.I.A. director and defense secretary under Mr. Obama, delivered a sharp rebuke of Mr. Trump’s comments Wednesday encouraging Russian intelligence services to hack Mrs. Clinton’s email.“Donald Trump today once again took Russia’s side,” Mr. Panetta said, adding, “it is inconceivable to me that any presidential candidate would be that irresponsible.”“This is no time to gamble with our future,” he said._____• Greeted with chants of his name, Harry Reid, the Senate Democrats’ retiring leader, outlined one final fight: defeating Mr. Trump to preserve the party’s legislative agenda. He also tied Senate Republicans, who he said had given rise to “a hateful con man,” to Mr. Trump’s candidacy, a strategy that Democrats think could help them retake control of the Senate._____• Governor Jerry Brown of California turned the convention’s full attention toward climate change for the first time this week. Calling it “the existential threat of our time,” Mr. Brown painted the Republican ticket as dangerously anti-science. And lifting California up as an example, he said Mrs. Clinton would help usher in a national green economy that would not only mitigate environmental disaster but also create jobs.“Trump says there’s no drought in California,” he said. “I say Trump lies.”_____• Crime and policing were major themes at last week’s Republican convention, but Charles H. Ramsey, a former head of police in Philadelphia and Washington, suggested they had missed the mark. Gun violence will drop with the adoption of “common sense” gun measures, he said, and “frayed” relationships between communities and police will be restored only through “strong, steady” leadership like Mrs. Clinton’s. “We can’t play to America’s worst fears,” he said. “We need to champion our greatest hopes.”"
Some Republicans Compliment Obama’s Speech for Stealing a G.O.P. Message,"PHILADELPHIA — For years President Obama has been a boogeyman to Republicans, uniting them in opposition to a Democrat they feel has taken the country in the wrong direction and failed to lead.But after a stirring speech at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night, many conservatives who cannot bring themselves to support their party’s nominee, Donald J. Trump, credited the president’s speech for being a strong one and expressed regret that Democrats appeared to be appropriating themes that were once the bedrock of their party.Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review magazine, called the speech “very effective” and noted that the Democrats were using classic Republicanisms.Mr. Obama invoked former President Ronald Reagan directly during the speech and said that the principles espoused at the Republican convention in Cleveland did not sound conservative at all.As Mr. Obama spoke, Erick Erickson, the conservative blogger who opposes Mr. Trump, said that his phone was lighting up with messages from disappointed Republicans. This was the kind of hopeful message Republicans should have been offering, they said, rather than obsessing over tearing down Hillary Clinton.Some Republican strategists found themselves angered at Mr. Obama’s speech, but for reasons that could spell trouble for Mr. Trump.“Used to being quite irate as the Dems lie about our nominee at their convention,” Mike Murphy, a former adviser to Senator John McCain and Mitt Romney, wrote in despair on Twitter. “This time it’s all true!”Mr. Trump’s flattery of foreign dictators, his mixed business record and his provocative proposals to build a wall and ban Muslim migration have given Democrats lot of fodder for attack ads and convention speeches this year.For those who competed against Mr. Trump during the Republican nominating contest, and warned of his vulnerabilities, the skewering from Mr. Obama brought a sense of wistfulness. Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush, who is a fierce critic of Mr. Trump, said Mr. Obama showed why the Republican nominee has been such a gift to Democrats.Of course, many Republicans panned the speech as more divisiveness from a president who they think accomplished little during his nearly eight years in office. Mr. Trump said on Thursday morning that “President Obama spoke last night about a world that doesn’t exist.”Others, such as a former spokesman for Senator Marco Rubio, could not help but express admiration for the smart stagecraft employed by the Democrats. The outreach to disaffected Republicans was both overt and subtle."
The Obama Years: The Best of Times to Be a Stock Investor,"President Obama hasn’t boasted much about the performance of the stock market during his time in office, but if he were inclined, he could do so with gusto.The facts are inescapable: The Obama years have been among the best of times to be a stock investor, going all the way back to the dawn of the 20th century.Consider that had you been prescient enough to buy shares of a low-cost stock index fund on Mr. Obama’s first inauguration day, on Jan. 20, 2009, you would now have tripled your money. Stock market performance of this level has rarely been surpassed.Yet this performance has not been as widely celebrated or appreciated as past bull markets have been, nor is it a major issue in this year’s presidential campaigns. The main reason may simply be that the current bull market is suspect because it came after one of the worst declines in stock market history.“Politicians almost seem embarrassed to talk about the stock market,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group. “It’s not a popular thing right now. But when you look at it, the record of the market under Obama is kind of incredible.”Buying stock wasn’t the obvious thing to do when Mr. Obama took office. The United States was still in the grips of the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression, and the Dow Jones industrial average had already declined 34 percent over the previous 12 months — and it was still dropping.People were fleeing the stock market. Many of them never returned and so never benefited from the last seven and a half years of rising asset prices. Federal Reserve data and Gallup poll data both indicate that direct and indirect stock ownership by American households is lower than it was at the beginning of President Obama’s first term in office.Wealthy people own stock, of course, but many people of more modest incomes do not. Unlike the days of the internet bubble in the late 1990s or the boom of the 1920s, when everybody seemed to be exchanging stock tips, the market these days is not terribly fashionable.Yet the market performance record is first-rate.I asked Mr. Hickey to run the historical numbers, and he found that since 1900, the Obama presidency has so far been the third best for stock investors. Using the Dow Jones industrial average, market performance has been better only during the presidencies of Calvin Coolidge, a Republican, in the Roaring ’20s; and Bill Clinton, a Democrat, from 1993 to early 2001, years that encompassed the tech bubble.The market under President Obama has risen 11.8 percent, on an annualized basis, without dividends. That compares with 25.5 percent for President Coolidge and 15.9 percent for President Clinton. It exceeds the Dow’s performance for everyone else, including three Republicans who were known for being pro-business and for tenures that coincided with strong stock markets: Ronald Reagan, with 11.3 percent; Dwight D. Eisenhower, with 10.4 percent; and George H. W. Bush, with 9.7 percent.It’s also noteworthy that since 1900, the market has performed better under Democrats, with a 6.7 percent annualized gain for the Dow, compared with a 3 percent gain under Republicans. Is it reasonable to conclude that Democratic presidents are better for stock investing than Republicans are? Probably not, especially with party alignments and policy positions in an extreme state of flux this year; even if this were true in the past, it may not be so in 2016 or in the future.Furthermore, if the direct impact of presidential policy on the economy is debatable, the effects on the stock market are even less clear. It is certainly difficult to demonstrate a strong cause and effect. But Mr. Hickey gave it a try: “Democrats spread the money around more than Republicans do, stimulating consumer spending, which is good for the economy and for the stock market,” he said, but that this connection is hard to quantify conclusively.That said, there are two obvious reasons for the market’s stellar performance in the Obama years.One is simply that, from a stock market standpoint, Mr. Obama had fortuitous timing. The market and the economy were already in such bad shape by the time he arrived in office that any signs of recovery were likely to result in a market rebound. Stocks did relatively well during much of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s tenure, for example, partly because they had done so badly during Herbert Hoover’s presidency at the start of the Great Depression.The second crucial factor is that the Federal Reserve, which the president does not control directly, embarked on an extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy, starting even before Mr. Obama took office. On Dec. 16, 2008, for example, one month after the presidential election, the Fed brought short-term rates sharply lower, close to zero.Fed interest rate policy may be the single most important factor behind the stock market boom. And even if Mr. Obama does not control the Fed, he did reappoint Ben S. Bernanke as Fed chairman in August 2009. In October 2013, the president appointed Janet L. Yellen as Mr. Bernanke’s successor. Under both, the Fed has held interest rates very low, which is helping to buoy the stock market and may be affecting the presidential election, as Ned Davis Research suggests in a recent note to clients.The financial market research firm’s survey of presidential elections and the stock market since 1900 concludes that (even though voters tend to tire of two-term presidents and their political parties) the kind of market we’ve seen this year is, if anything, auspicious for the incumbent Democratic Party. “The stock market action so far this year is very much aligning up to support an incumbent party retaining the White House,” said Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist for Ned Davis Research and a co-author of the note.The economy, which isn’t strong, is at least not in recession, he said, and the Fed’s monetary policy is expansionary, while fiscal policy is looser than it was during Mr. Obama’s first term, which was bedeviled by the “fiscal cliff” budget impasse. He also cited this year’s stock market pattern, which includes a correction — a decline of a little more than 10 percent — that ended in February, along with a smart recovery. All of that helps to tilt the odds in favor of an incumbent party victory, he said. A major market decline before the election could shift matters, however.This kind of tea leaf reading implies that the stock market is affecting the country’s mood and political alignment, even if it’s not being widely recognized. Investors may not give the president any credit for their portfolio returns. But the numbers are straightforward enough, and for those fortunate enough to hold stock, they are heartening: It’s been a splendid market."
Donald Trump Is Making Major Ad Buy in Battleground States,"Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign is preparing to hit the airwaves on Monday with a new advertising blitz in swing states that casts Hillary Clinton as a candidate who would crush the middle class under a mountain of new taxes.The $10 million ad buy is the largest to date for Mr. Trump in the general election. His message will be broadcast in Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida, New Hampshire, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada — a batch of battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the race in November.A spokesman for the Trump campaign, Jason Miller, confirmed the ad buy, which was reported earlier by The Associated Press, in a Twitter message.Titled “Two Americas: Economy,” the new ad features struggling workers in crumbling neighborhoods and declares that under Mrs. Clinton’s leadership the country would experience “more of the same, but worse.” The ad then cuts to Mr. Trump’s economic vision, with happy workers enjoying higher wages and more jobs. It concludes with a shot of the glistening new 1 World Trade Center.Mr. Trump has so far been lagging far behind Mrs. Clinton when it comes to spending on advertising. This month, his campaign invested $4 million for ads in four swing states to hammer home his immigration message. The Clinton campaign has spent more than $60 million so far.During the primary election season, Mr. Trump was also slow to spend on television ads, instead relying on free exposure gained through regular news conferences and interviews with an array of media outlets.But since becoming the Republican nominee, Mr. Trump has scaled down that approach, favoring conservative outlets and scripted speeches."
New National Poll Shows Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Essentially Tied,"A national poll released Tuesday shows that Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton are entering the final stretch of the presidential race essentially tied, and the survey revealed a country deeply divided on a racial and gender lines ahead of the November election.A survey from CNN/ORC shows 45 percent of likely voters backing Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, and 43 percent supporting Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic standard-bearer. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party candidate who is banking on late surge in the polls to be included in the presidential debates, sits in third place at 7 percent.The poll suggests that the post-convention bounces have subsided and that Mr. Trump has weathered a difficult August, in which he shuffled staff members, insulted a Gold Star family and confused voters about his immigration policy. But Mrs. Clinton continues to face questions about her honesty, and new revelations about her email practices as secretary of state have cast a shadow over her campaign.Mrs. Clinton was leading most national and state polls after the Democratic National Convention in late July, but Mr. Trump has gradually been gaining some ground in recent weeks. She still has the upper hand in most of the crucial swing states, such as Pennsylvania and Florida, that will likely decide the election.The contours of the race remain relatively unchanged, according to the CNN poll. Mrs. Clinton continues to hold large leads with women, minorities and voters with college degrees. Mr. Trump does best with men, white voters and those who did not go to college.On issues, Mr. Trump is seen as the strongest candidate to manage the economy and handle terrorism, while Mrs. Clinton wins on foreign policy and has an edge on immigration.Voters view Mr. Trump as being the more honest candidate, but they prefer Mrs. Clinton’s temperament when it comes to being best suited to be commander in chief. Last week, Mr. Trump engaged in a Twitter spat with the president of Mexico, raising questions about his ability to deal with other world leaders.But Mr. Trump, who has been moderating his positions recently, has also gained an advantage over Mrs. Clinton when it comes to appealing to independent voters. Nearly half of those queried say they would vote for the Republican nominee, while 29 percent say they would vote for Mrs. Clinton.Although the poll does not indicate whether Mr. Johnson is pulling voters from either candidate, his supporters tend to be younger and more highly educated — suggesting that they would be more likely to be potential backers of Mrs. Clinton.The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points."
Donald Trump Jr. Invokes Holocaust Imagery in Complaint Against Media,"Donald Trump Jr. invoked Holocaust imagery when complaining about media favoritism given toward Hillary Clinton, arguing that if Republicans lied the way Democrats do, the press would be “warming up the gas chamber right now.”The Trump campaign has been complaining aggressively that the mainstream media is working against the candidacy of Donald J. Trump, who has recently been giving most of his interviews to conservative outlets. In an interview with a Philadelphia radio station on Wednesday, the younger Mr. Trump said that the media has built up Mrs. Clinton and that it is her No. 1 surrogate.“They’ve let her slide on every discrepancy, on every lie, on every D.N.C. game trying to get Bernie Sanders out of this thing,” said Mr. Trump, the candidate’s oldest son, alluding to the Democratic National Committee. “If Republicans were doing that, they’d be warming up the gas chamber right now.”The comments come as the Trump campaign has faced criticism for failing to sufficiently disavow support from the so-called alt-right movement, a group widely considered white supremacists and who often express anti-Semitic views.Last week, Donald Trump Jr. drew a backlash for pushing back against Mrs. Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment by posting on Instagram an image that included Pepe the Frog. The frog is a popular alt-right symbol.Holocaust references can be something of a third rail in American politics. Last year Republicans called on Mike Huckabee to apologize when he said that President Obama’s Iran policy would “take the Israelis and march them to the door of the oven.”The gas chamber comment was quickly picked up in the Israeli press and critics of Mr. Trump, such as the independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin, who said that the statement was revealing.“An unsurprising Nazi reference from the ‘alt-right’ movement’s presidential campaign,” Mr. McMullin wrote in a post on Twitter. “This is the real Trump.”The Anti-Defamation League also scolded Donald Trump Jr. for showing a lack of sensitivity about the Holocaust.The group, which works to combat anti-Semitism, called on him to retract his comment.A spokesman for the Trump campaign, Jason Miller, said that Mr. Trump’s words were being twisted for political purposes. “Don Jr. was clearly referring to capital punishment to make the case that the media continues to take words out of context in order to serve as the propaganda arm of the Hillary Clinton campaign,” Mr. Miller said.Donald Trump Jr.’s sister, Ivanka, is a convert to Judaism."
"Presidential Election: Trump Hits $100 Million in Small Donations in October, Team Says","With only six days left in the presidential race, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump are working overtime to turn out voters, but their power to shift the direction of the race diminishes every day.Both campaigns still have important decisions to make as they fine-tune their approaches — decisions that could affect who wins, and also how that person wins and how the victory is interpreted.Some of the key dynamics we are watching in a race that will undoubtedly twist and turn to the end:Donald J. Trump raised $100 million in small donations in October, his campaign announced on Thursday. But Mr. Trump’s announcement — made in a news release sent to reporters late in the afternoon — contained few other details, and his figures cannot be independently verified until after Election Day, when the winning and losing campaigns file their next financial disclosures with the Federal Election Commission.Mr. Trump’s tally appeared to include money raised into party accounts he jointly controls, but did not specify what threshold he used for “small” donations, and a spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for clarification. The release did not specify whether the total represented any money that was raised earlier in the year but was only recently transferred into his campaign accounts.The Trump team’s last official F.E.C. report was filed last week and covered the first 19 days of October. Using a conventional measure of small donations — checks from people giving less than $200 — Mr. Trump would have had to raise about $65 million from small contributions during the remaining days in October, effectively tripling his clip with these donors. That would be a huge jump.But it is also possible that Mr. Trump is including contributions of more than $200 in his tally, since he has been collecting relatively few large checks. If Mr. Trump’s figure included all the money raised in the first part of October, then he would have had to raise $40 million to reach $100 million by the end of the month.That would leave him at more or less on the same pace as earlier in the month — and only a slightly faster clip than in September.In a statement accompanying Mr. Trump’s news release, his digital director, Brad Parscale, said: “Hitting a 100 million dollar goal in October is an amazing milestone for the campaign as it shows how Mr. Trump’s message is resonating with millions of voters across the country.”The killing of two police officers in the Des Moines area has caused the Clinton campaign to change its schedule.Tim Kaine, former President Bill Clinton and the singer Ben Harper were planning a get-out-the vote performance at the Des Moines Social Club on Wednesday night, but the event was scrapped because of the tragedy.Mr. Trump, who has in the past used attacks on police to amplify his “law and order” message, offered a measured response and said that he was praying for the families of the officers.“An attack on those who keep us safe is an attack on all of us,” Mr. Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.For Mr. Trump, the difference between trailing Mrs. Clinton by a little and trailing by a lot has often been the strength of his backing from other Republicans. Campaigning on a set of themes unlike any other recent Republican nominee, Mr. Trump has occasionally fallen behind by landslide margins when conservative-leaning voters shifted away from him.Shunned by many party leaders, Mr. Trump is plainly still working to rally Republicans: His running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, has been publicly pleading with partisans to “come home” to their presidential ticket. Mr. Pence is campaigning in Arizona on Wednesday, a traditionally conservative state where Mr. Trump has struggled.Republican support alone cannot make Mr. Trump the next president. But only by improving and cementing his support on the right can Mr. Trump get close to Mrs. Clinton on Election Day and leave a lasting mark on the party he has helmed since spring.Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump are largely battling over a handful of big swing states: Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. But both are also traveling outside the traditional map this week and throwing money at television commercials in unexpected places.Mrs. Clinton was in Arizona on Wednesday, seeking to exploit Mr. Trump’s weakness with Hispanic voters and suburban whites. Mr. Trump visited Michigan and New Mexico earlier in the week, trying to find new paths to victory in the Electoral College, where Mrs. Clinton holds a considerable advantage. But he returned to conventional turf on Wednesday, with three stops in Florida on his schedule.While Democrats express confidence that they can repel Mr. Trump’s forays, they are leaving little to chance: Mrs. Clinton now plans to visit Detroit on Friday. If Mr. Trump finds his path forward continually frustrated, could he add another long-shot state or two?Although Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party nominee, has been dropping in most polls since he was left out of the presidential debates, the ticket could still have an impact in a close race, given its popularity in states such as New Mexico and Colorado.Confusing the matter is the fact that William F. Weld, the party’s vice-presidential nominee, essentially endorsed Mrs. Clinton in an interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Tuesday night.“Well I’m here vouching for Mrs. Clinton and I think it’s high time somebody did and I’m doing it based on my personal experience with her and I think she deserves to have people vouch for her,” Mr. Weld said when asked if his loyalty to the Libertarian Party was stronger than his fear of a Trump presidency.Mr. Weld, a former Republican governor of Massachusetts, acknowledged that he and Mr. Johnson have many policy disagreements and that they no longer have a chance to win the presidency this year.For his part, Mr. Johnson has kept up his attacks on Mrs. Clinton and in a debate with Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee, he suggested that she would be “engaged in the impeachment process” on day one if elected.With his fired-up return to the trail on Tuesday, Mr. Obama showed again why he is Mrs. Clinton’s most valuable surrogate. He is the most popular person in national politics and perhaps uniquely effective at reaching black voters and young people at a moment when Democrats are anxious about turnout. That makes him a powerful asset to Mrs. Clinton in a state like North Carolina, where he campaigned on Wednesday.“I hate to put pressure on you, but the fate of the republic rests on your shoulders,” Mr. Obama said at rally in North Carolina.She has largely been absent since the Republican convention in July, but Ms. Trump will make an appearance on behalf of her husband in suburban Philadelphia on Thursday.According to the campaign, Ms. Trump will “address the American people to get out the vote and share what a Trump Administration’s vision would be like for American women, children and families” at the event at the Main Line Sports Center in Berwyn.Ms. Trump has maintained that she has kept a low profile so that she can focus on raising her young child, but the campaign hinted that she would help her husband make his final pitch to voters."
Highlights of Hillary Clinton’s Concession Speech and President Obama’s Remarks,"Hillary Clinton publicly conceded the election to Donald J. Trump on Wednesday, acknowledging the pain of the defeat in remarks in New York while calling on her supporters to accept that he would be president and give him a chance to lead with an open mind.President Obama, speaking in Washington, also said that he would work to ensure a smooth transition to a Trump administration and that, despite their differences, we are “all rooting for his success.”Speaker Paul D. Ryan proclaimed that Mr. Trump had achieved a political feat and earned a mandate by reaching new voters. Mr. Ryan said that he was certain that they would work well together on a conservative policy agenda.Global markets swooned overnight but stabilized as investors considered the possibility that Mr. Trump’s mix of policies might bolster the economy.. News of Mr. Trump’s election was met with a mix of shock, uncertainty and some congratulations around the world.• Mrs. Clinton thanked her supporters in her concession speech, and said that she felt pride in the campaign she ran.• Of Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton said she hoped that he would be “a successful president for all Americans,” and that she respected and cherished the peaceful transition of power. She told her supporters that they must accept that Mr. Trump would be president. “We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead,” she said. But she also acknowledged that the country was more divided than she had realized.• After a long campaign, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that the loss cuts deep. “This is painful, and it will be for a long time,” she said. She also expressed regret that she did not shatter the glass ceiling, but said, “Someday, someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.”• Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, who spoke before Mrs. Clinton, said, “I’m proud of Hillary Clinton because she has been and is a great history maker,” pointing to her long career of public service. He saluted her for winning the popular vote in the election, drawing cheers.• Mr. Obama said that he and former President George W. Bush had major differences eight years ago, but they managed a successful transition. He said he expected to do the same with Mr. Trump, while acknowledging that they have their differences, and he invited the president-elect to come to the White House on Thursday.• Mr. Obama reminded the country that we “are all on the same team” and characterized politics as an “intramural scrimmage.” He said that he was heartened by the conversation that he had with Mr. Trump at 3:30 a.m. and that he hoped Mr. Trump maintains that spirit.• Mr. Obama said that he was proud of Mrs. Clinton, who gave her concession speech on Wednesday just before Mr. Obama spoke, and called her a historic figure.• Mr. Obama called on Americans to move forward with the presumption of good faith in fellow citizens. He said that those who were disappointed should not give up on their dreams. “Sometimes you lose an argument, sometimes you lose an election,” he said, with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. by his side. “But the path this country has taken has never been a straight line. We zig and zag.”The Vermont senator, who ran against Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic primary campaign, was silent on the election for most of Wednesday, but in the early evening he offered something of an olive branch to Mr. Trump and acknowledged the middle class anger that he tapped into.“To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him,” Mr. Sanders said in a statement.But Mr. Sanders maintained that he is opposed to much of what Mr. Trump has stood for and that he will fight any intolerance that he might try to promote as president.“To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him,” Mr. Sanders said.Mr. Ryan congratulated Mr. Trump for accomplishing an “enormous political feat” on Wednesday and said that he was looking forward to working with him to carry forward a Republican policy agenda and prioritize the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.“This health care law is not a popular law,” Mr. Ryan said, adding that Congress had already shown it can get a repeal bill to the president’s desk. “This health care law is collapsing of its own weight.”That clearly indicated that Republican leaders would use budget rules, called reconciliation, to gut the Affordable Care Act with only a majority of Congress, as they did in January. Senate Democrats would be powerless to filibuster the legislation under the parliamentary rules.Mr. Ryan, who has had differences with Mr. Trump, said that they had spoken twice in the last 18 hours and that he was “very excited” about their ability to work together.“He just earned a mandate,” Mr. Ryan said.The last two Republican presidents gave the next Republican president congratulatory telephone calls on Wednesday.“Laura and I wish the president-elect, Melania and the entire Trump family all our very best as they take on an awesome responsibility and begin an exciting new chapter in their lives,” former President George W. Bush said in a statement.Mr. Bush had been critical of Mr. Trump when he was campaigning on behalf of his brother Jeb this year but said that he was rooting for Mr. Trump now.“We pray for the success of our country and the success of our new president,” Mr. Bush said.Mr. Bush’s father, George Bush, the 41st president, also spoke to Mr. Trump on Wednesday. A spokesman said that they talked for about five minutes and that the call was friendly and gracious.“Good luck on your new challenge,” Mr. Bush said.Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor vanquished by Mr. Trump during the Republican primary process, sent Mr. Trump a congratulatory message on Twitter.Dozens of Republican elected officials resisted Mr. Trump’s rise to power, including some who revoked their endorsements in the heat of the general election. Senators like Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona declared Mr. Trump unfit to lead, while ideological conservatives like Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Mike Lee of Utah warned of Mr. Trump’s indifference to the limits of government power.These Trump critics on the right now face a wrenching political choice: to defer to him as the country’s new leader, or to take up a quasi-oppositional role against a Republican as he assembles his administration. Since Republicans kept control of the House and Senate, dissenters within Mr. Trump’s party may hold outsize influence over exactly how he can govern as president.Mr. Graham took a reserved approach in his statement on the election on Tuesday, saying that he would aim to help Mr. Trump govern — within the bounds of a fairly conventional Republican agenda."
‘Something Big Is Happening’: Readers React to Trump’s Russian Ties,"New York Times readers responded strongly to the revelation that members of President Trump’s campaign staff and other associates spoke repeatedly to Russian officials in the year before the election, according to four current and former American officials. Below is a selection of the thousands of comments received on nytimes.com.Comments were edited for length and clarity.Some readers questioned whether the actions of Mr. Trump’s campaign staff and associates were treasonous.“I’m trying to figure out one scenario where the Trump campaign having repeated contacts with Russian intelligence during the campaign is NOT treasonous. Either they were collaborating with the Russians or they were private citizens engaging in foreign diplomacy. Neither is OK.” — Dan in Atlanta“These Russian contacts could, potentially, be treason. That puts this at a whole other level. Things are moving at warp speed by D.C. standards. Something big is happening, very big.” — RBS in Maine_____ But many readers were more concerned about United States officials disclosing information about the contacts with Russian intelligence officials. “Why are intel officers leaking classified investigations? That should be the real story. The leakers see themselves as above the law.” — Brian in Boston“Far too many Trump critics appear not to care that these intelligence agents leaked highly sensitive information to the press — mostly because Trump critics are pleased with the result.President Trump is correct. These leaks are an enormous problem. And in a less polarized context, they would be recognized immediately for what they clearly are: an effort to manipulate public opinion for the sake of achieving a desired political outcome. It is weaponized spin.” — Joe Perrino in US“While I’m appalled by Michael Flynn’s actions and the general ineptitude that is being demonstrated by the new administration, I am equally worried about an aspect of this case that is being overlooked.Namely, a new American presidential administration and its officials are being undermined and second-guessed by a series of leaks, including intelligence leaks, consisting of material presumably from wiretaps on American citizens, namely Flynn and possibly others, who were incoming members of that administration.This is an equally, if not more alarming and ugly development in American democratic politics.” — Alan Carmody in New York_____Other readers  called the matter  evidence of a “witch hunt” against Republicans, or “sour grapes” on the part of Democrats.“The Republicans won the election and the Democrats are furious with the outcome. The investigation will lead them to the same conclusion: that Mr. Trump won fair and square. They cannot fathom that their candidate, Hillary Clinton, was the loser. It is a case of sour grapes. How much are these continual investigations costing the taxpayers? ” — WMK in New York_____Some readers criticized The Times for publishing an article based on four anonymous sources, all credited as current or former American officials.“Even the unnamed in this article say there is no evidence of a crime. It is all talk, no substance. Hey, look over here, a bunch of calls were made. Then a bunch of subtle hinting at things that never happened. Fake news.” — Smoke in New York“Enough. Enough. Enough. This is tantamount to fomenting a coup of a democratically elected government. You are dreadfully irresponsible. You owe the American public more than the anonymous voices of cowards. Treasonous cowards I might add.You have no right to publish the unfounded, unverified gossip when it has this level of impact. Get the names on record. I want proof, not gossip from moles. If their conviction is so strong, give us names.” — Scott Covin in Jacksonville, Fla.“When information was leaked about the unsavory dealings of the DNC, the exposed scandal was mostly ignored and the reporting centered only on how the information was obtained.Now that the shoe’s on the other foot, the media is focused on accusations and innuendo with little regard for the ‘anonymous’ sources or the fact that they could be leaking classified information, It’s sad that that’s the NYT I’ve come to expect.” — Dave T. in Chicago_____Many readers questioned whether  the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, knew about the contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials.“There’s something wrong here. Comey announces to the world, right before the election, that the F.B.I is investigating newly found emails involving Hillary Clinton, but at the last hour reveals that nothing new was found.Meanwhile, nothing at all is disclosed about an ongoing investigation into unauthorized contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence, which apparently runs deeper than anyone could ever imagine. What is going on in this country?” — Ez1 in Monterey, Calif._____Other  readers disagreed, saying that Mr. Comey was not to blame for the latest allegations. “I still believe, in time, Jim Comey will be found to be an honest broker. I, too, am very disappointed by his actions re: [Hillary Clinton] before the election. But looking at the larger picture of his career, he has done many admirable things. I hope he will soon bring some criminal charges.” — Janie in the Midwest“Director Comey is no dummy. I tend to believe that he favored the Republican party during the campaign, ignored the ‘bad news’ and put his finger on the scale. Then, it would seem, he opened his eyes to see just how incompetent Trump is and is now forced to take action.” — WillyD in New Jersey_____Some  called the difference in the treatment of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump an example of male privilege.“Lets see. Hillary Clinton uses an unprotected server, putting her messages at risk of being intercepted by the Russians. Meanwhile Donald Trump and his gang communicated directly with the Russians before the election. That’s OK because they’re successful hard driving business executives who play all the angles? That’s male privilege at its absolute best.” — Carl Hultberg in New Hampshire_____Other readers would like to see Mr. Trump be transparent with the American people.“Americans need Trump to come clean on his ties to Russia. Our national security is compromised.” — John Adams in California“I am no expert in how campaigns are run but it seems believable that it’s normal (and perhaps advisable) for them to talk to important foreign players.Why doesn’t the Trump team simply point this out? It might not be the talks themselves, but the cover up afterwards, that hurts this administration the most. The attempts at a cover up make the administration look guilty.” — Alex Grove in London_____Several readers recommended writing to members of Congress or protesting as a way to register anger with the government’s response to the revelations.“This goes beyond politics. Call your representatives to urge them to open an independent investigation led by a special prosecutor, not Jeff Sessions, who was intimately involved in the Trump campaign, which we are now learning was colluding with the Russian government to interfere in the election.” — DBT in Houston“There must be protests on a massive scale to pressure them into patriotism, protests bigger than the Women’s March, on par with Romania a few weeks ago. The stakes are too high to do anything less.” — Ashleigh Adams in Colorado_____"
"Does Amazon Pay Taxes? Contrary to Trump Tweet, Yes","After President Trump accused Amazon on Wednesday morning of hurting local retailers and jobs by not paying taxes, the company’s shares dipped in premarket trading.“Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt — many jobs being lost!” he tweeted Wednesday morning, echoing his earlier characterizations of the company as a “no-tax monopoly” that does not pay “internet taxes.”Mr. Trump’s suggestion that Amazon does not pay taxes is false. The company, in its latest annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that it paid $177 million in income taxes in 2014, $273 million in 2015 and $412 million last year.S&P Global Market Intelligence found that Amazon paid an average tax rate covering federal, state, local and foreign taxes of 13 percent from 2007 to 2015, according to analysis provided to The New York Times. That is a smaller share than the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock average of 26.9 percent, and the federal corporate tax rate of 35 percent, but on par with Mr. Trump’s proposed 15 percent rate.If Mr. Trump’s point was that Amazon did not collect sales taxes — which are owed by the purchaser and collected by the retailer — it is true that the company once avoided doing so.“If this was five years ago, the tweet would be making a very compelling point,” said Carl Davis, the research director of the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Historically, “there is no doubt that Amazon used its ability to not collect sales tax to gain a competitive advantage.”But that criticism is outdated.The Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that a state can require retailers to collect a sales tax only if they have a physical presence in that state, so an out-of-state e-commerce company with no store or distribution center in that state has no obligation to do so. Several states have enacted broad laws, colloquially called “Amazon laws,” that attempt to counteract this disparity between e-commerce and brick-and-mortar businesses.As recently as 2012, Amazon was collecting a sales tax in only five states, according Mr. Davis. He also noted that Amazon “cut ties with in-state businesses to avoid collecting sales tax” in several states between 2009 and 2014.During this time period, liberal think tanks and analysts made the same point as Mr. Trump about Amazon’s effect on localities.“Amazon’s refusal to collect sales tax in most states hurts state and local governments’ ability to finance education, health care and other services,” the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in 2010.The company began to collect sales taxes in 2012 in California, where it began to build warehouses, as well as in Texas, Pennsylvania and other states, The Times reported. By the end of 2016, Amazon’s tax collection had expanded to 29 states, according to Mr. Davis.And as of this April, Amazon has collected sales taxes in all states that have one. (Five states — Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon — do not.) Amazon does not, however, require third-party sellers on its marketplace to collect sales taxes, but offers the service to them.“Other large e-retailers, most notably eBay, generally do not collect sales tax still,” said Joseph Henchman, the executive vice president of the free-market-oriented Tax Foundation. Amazon, on the other hand, “ultimately changed their position.”"
"In Beijing and Abu Dhabi, Signs of Bannon’s Continued Influence","WASHINGTON — Stephen K. Bannon met privately with a top Chinese government official and a key leader in the Persian Gulf during a recent trip to Asia and the Middle East, demonstrating that President Trump’s former chief strategist is still viewed as an influential figure abroad.In Beijing, Mr. Bannon spent 90 minutes with Wang Qishan, a powerful member of the standing committee of the Chinese Politburo who is leading President Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign. In the United Arab Emirates, he met the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who arguably has more sway over American policy in the region than any other Arab leader.The trip this month came just a few weeks after Mr. Bannon was forced out of the White House, returning to his role as an outside agitator for his nationalist agenda. But if Mr. Bannon’s day-to-day access to Mr. Trump has diminished, his reputation as an ideological bomb-thrower has not, particularly in countries like China that zealously monitor American politics.John L. Thornton, a former president of Goldman Sachs who has taught at Tsinghua University in Beijing and has longstanding ties to the Chinese leadership, helped arrange Mr. Bannon’s meeting with Mr. Wang, which was first reported by the Financial Times on Thursday.He met with two other Chinese officials while in Beijing, one of whom selects articles from the People’s Daily for the Chinese leadership, according to two people briefed on the meetings. The purpose, these people said, was to discuss the rise of economic nationalism and populism.Earlier, in Hong Kong, Mr. Bannon spoke behind closed doors to investors at a conference sponsored by a politically connected Chinese investment bank. Among his themes was that China and other Asia countries had thrived against the West by running mercantilist trade systems.“To avoid a trade war,” Mr. Bannon told his audience, “China must cease its economic war against America.”His meeting with Prince bin Zayed came at a sensitive moment, days after Mr. Trump failed to broker a resolution to a bitter dispute pitting Qatar against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Qatar’s neighbors cut off diplomatic ties and imposed a blockade after accusing Doha of a multitude of sins, from financing militant groups to currying favor with Iran.Mr. Bannon got to know Prince bin Zayed during the presidential transition when the Emirates royal met him at Trump Tower, along with Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Michael T. Flynn, who was to become Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser.Mr. Bannon declined to discuss the details of his meetings. But it is not hard, given his views and recent proximity to Mr. Trump, to guess why foreign leaders would seek him out. He still talks to the president from time to time, even if the White House plays down the frequency of those contacts.More than his value as a conduit, Mr. Bannon is viewed as the intellectual force behind the political movement that carried Mr. Trump to the White House. Now back in his old job at the far-right media outlet, Breitbart News Network, he is pushing his agenda and punishing those who he believes are traitors to the cause.For Mr. Bannon, getting time with Mr. Wang put him as close as he could get to President Xi himself. A former mayor of Beijing and executive vice governor of Guangdong Province, Mr. Wang, 69, is the president’s right-hand man, particularly in carrying out his crackdown on corruption in the Communist Party.Mr. Wang meets regularly with prominent Americans, including Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state, and Henry M. Paulson, the former Treasury secretary. People who know Mr. Wang describe him as well-read, intellectually curious and unafraid to engage in fierce debates with his visitors.“Wang met with Bannon for two reasons,” said Jeffrey A. Bader, who served as President Barack Obama’s top adviser on China. “He was persuaded that Bannon still has influence with the administration. He’s also a guy who likes to think on a big scale, and likes to talk to other people who think on a big scale.”Mr. Bannon, who once lived in Shanghai, has said he views China as the greatest long-term threat to the United States. “A hundred years from now, this is what they’ll remember,” he declared in a recent interview. “What we did to confront China on its rise to world domination.”“China right now is Germany in 1930,” Mr. Bannon said. “It’s on the cusp. It could go one way or the other.”"
"Are N.F.L. Ratings ‘Way Down,’ as Trump Says? Not Exactly","During his recent social media fusillade against the N.F.L. and its players, President Trump claimed that ratings for football games were “way down,” except during pregame shows “when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!”But data released Tuesday contradicts Mr. Trump’s point. Ratings for the N.F.L.’s Week 3 games — the first played since he suggested players who don’t stand for the national anthem should be fired — actually increased by 3 percent from last year, according to The Hollywood Reporter.Viewership did decline during three Sunday games, but increased in the 1 p.m. slot on CBS as well as during Thursday Night Football. Monday night’s game, between the Dallas Cowboys and the Arizona Cardinals, spiked 63 percent in viewership from last year when the game shared the same time slot as the first presidential debate.A White House spokesman referred The Times to viewership increases in pregame shows, so Mr. Trump has a point that his comments may have had an impact.Nonetheless, his description of game viewership as “way down” is overstated, sports rating analysts agreed.The league has seen a modest decline in viewership over the past few years, said Jon Lewis, who reports under the pseudonym “Paulsen” for Sports Media Watch, a website that specializes in following television ratings. But Mr. Lewis disagreed with the notion that there were “plummeting numbers.”Austin Karp, the assistant managing editor of SportsBusiness Daily, said it was too early to know what football’s viewership trends would look like this year. He noted that there were “lots of moving parts.” For instance, he said that the first week of games was “heavily affected by Hurricane Irma TV coverage, leading to a drop in ratings for the N.F.L. to start the season.”There’s a larger trend of a decline in linear television viewership to factor in as well. Ratings have been declining for most broadcasters for years now. Live sports coverage has somewhat bucked this trend. And among American audiences, football still commands more viewers than just about any other sport. Mr. Karp noted that both NBC’s Sunday Night Football, which declined by 15 percent from last year, and CBS’s Sunday games both averaged more viewers than the last 11 iterations of the Daytona 500 for Nascar, which Mr. Trump notably praised and contrasted with the N.F.L. on Twitter.Both analysts are skeptical that backlash to players taking a knee during the national anthem is driving the decline, given that the trend began before the former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s first demonstration during the 2016 season. “I’ve seen little to no evidence of viewers tuning out due to kneeling or not kneeling,” Mr. Karp said.Ultimately, “people tune into sports for the sport,” Mr. Lewis said.Or, as my colleague Kevin Draper, a sports reporter for The Times has put it: “The unsatisfying truth is that N.F.L. ratings are a Rorschach test, often revealing more about the test taker than the subject.”Read his full report here on the greater trends impacting football viewership beyond this current climate of criticism and protests."
Trump Misleadingly Blames Bob Corker for Iran Deal,"WASHINGTON — Call it the two birds, one tweet approach: As he continues to feud with Senator Bob Corker, President Trump is now also blaming the Tennessee Republican for the Iran nuclear deal that the White House is threatening to decertify, perhaps as soon as this week.But it is a misleading charge: Mr. Corker, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, repeatedly spoke out against the accord to limit Tehran’s nuclear program before it was brokered by world powers in 2015.“Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that’s about it,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Sunday.On Tuesday, the White House offered details. “Senator Corker worked with Nancy Pelosi and the Obama administration to pave the way for that legislation, and basically rolled out the red carpet for the Iran deal,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters, referring to the House Democratic leader.She was talking about a bill that Mr. Corker sponsored and pushed through in the spring of 2015 to give Congress some say over the deal, as Republicans demanded at the time.In a March 12, 2015, letter to President Barack Obama, Mr. Corker said that an agreement without a congressional vote would be “a direct affront to the American people and seeks to undermine Congress’s appropriate role.”Mr. Corker’s bipartisan bill, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, essentially gave Congress 30 days to review the deal, and additional time to override a veto from the president.Mr. Obama opposed the bill initially — as did the National Iranian American Council — and White House officials repeatedly said the president would veto it. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which criticized the final accord, supported Mr. Corker’s bill.Ultimately, Josh Earnest, Mr. Obama’s spokesman, said that while the president was not “particularly thrilled” about the legislation, the White House viewed it as a compromise. Israel’s intelligence minister characterized the agreement between the White House and Congress as an “achievement for Israeli policy.”A month later, Mr. Corker’s bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan majorities in both chambers, 98 to 1 in the Senate and 400 to 25 in the House, and became law on May 22, 2015.After the final Iran deal was reached in July 2015, Mr. Corker urged his colleagues to reject it. Democrats blocked Republicans from doing so through procedural votes; Mr. Corker voted three times with his party. He also voted for an amendment to bar Mr. Obama from lifting sanctions on Iran, which did not survive a Democratic filibuster.Ms. Sanders conceded Mr. Corker’s votes but said his bill legitimized the deal — even though the Obama administration had repeatedly suggested it did not need congressional approval for the agreement.Jack Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School and former senior Justice Department official, said at the time that Mr. Corker’s bill gave Congress power to delay the nuclear deal — even if it was unable to block it. “Absent the Iran Review Act, President Obama could have lifted U.S. sanctions last week,” Mr. Goldsmith wrote in July 2015."
"Ted Cruz, Who Is Not the Zodiac Killer, Acknowledges a Long-Running Joke","Let’s get this out of the way first: Ted Cruz is not the Zodiac killer.We’re pretty sure. The infamous serial killer’s last confirmed murder was in 1969, while the senator from Texas was born in 1970. We feel the need to be very clear about this: Ted Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, is almost surely not the Zodiac killer. It’s just about impossible.But that’s long been a joke on the internet. And on Wednesday, Mr. Cruz, who evidence suggests is unlikely to be the Zodiac killer, posted the following on Twitter:You might recognize the image as a coded letter the Zodiac killer once sent. This does not, any reasonable person would conclude, offer definitive proof that Mr. Cruz is the Zodiac killer, who was blamed for at least five murders in the San Francisco Bay Area and has never been identified.But it did make for a suitable distraction on Wednesday, as people on Twitter erupted at what appeared to be Mr. Cruz’s first acknowledgment of the long-running joke.Did the one-time presidential candidate score a few points for being in on the joke? Did he ruin what was once a fun joke?Others — surely including those hearing about it for the first time through this article — were all sorts of baffled. Why did he tweet the Zodiac note? Why do people say he’s the Zodiac killer? Does anything make sense anymore?No, it most certainly does not. But to make sense of Wednesday’s events — which do not matter in any significant way, as none of this matters in a cosmic sense — we begin at the origin of the meme.Like many other memes and jokes, there’s no real reason for it. According to the meme-tracking website Know Your Meme, joking references to Mr. Cruz being the Zodiac killer date to at least 2013.That’s it. There’s no more story than that. People thought it was a funny joke, more people picked up on it, and it became much more widespread as Mr. Cruz became a steady news figure during the Republican presidential primaries. The comedian Larry Wilmore focused on the gag when he hosted the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2016.Public Policy Polling, which often inserted whimsical questions into its polls during the campaign season, found that 10 percent of Florida Republicans said they thought that Mr. Cruz was the Zodiac killer, while 28 percent were not sure.Until now, Mr. Cruz had publicly ignored the joke. His wife, Heidi Cruz, once responded to it, telling Yahoo News: “Well, I’ve been married to him for 15 years and I know pretty well who he is, so it doesn’t bother me at all. There’s a lot of garbage out there.”That brings us to Wednesday. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, spilled a soda (it was Dr Pepper) on Mr. Cruz during a Senate hearing. That prompted a playful back-and-forth from the two senators’ Twitter accounts.Mr. Sasse said that he “was wearing my ‘Lee Harvey Oswald Was Framed’ T-shirt,” a reference to the time President Trump accused Mr. Cruz’s father of associating with the man who assassinated John F. Kennedy.Then Mr. Cruz — or someone on his staff who runs the Twitter account — responded to the tweet with the Zodiac killer’s note.That left Twitter users to sort out whether the Texas senator should be applauded for his sense of humor, or whether the time had finally come to put this joke to rest.The Zodiac killer, who is not Ted Cruz, remains unidentified."
Trump Falsely Ties British Crime Rise to ‘Radical Islamic Terror’,"President Trump inaccurately linked a report of increasing crime in parts of Britain to “radical Islamic terror” in a tweet early Friday.Mr. Trump’s use of quotation marks suggests he is directly citing a passage from a recently released report. The White House did not respond when asked what exactly Mr. Trump was quoting, but the British Office for National Statistics, in a bulletin released on Thursday, estimated a 13 percent increase in “police recorded crime” in England and Wales from June 2016 to June 2017.First, the United Kingdom also includes Scotland and Northern Ireland.But more to Mr. Trump’s point, nowhere does the bulletin contain the words “amid spread of Radical Islamic terror.” If Mr. Trump is suggesting that the rise in crime is caused by Islamic terrorism, the report does not support that.Two terrorists attacks, in London in June and in the northwest English city of Manchester in May, together killed 35 people and involved what the agency called 294 attempted murders. They represented 0.0006 percent of the total 5.2 million crimes during the period covered by the report. Over all, homicides actually decreased 2 percent.“Violence against persons” — a broad category that includes terrorist attacks as one type of crime — totaled about 1.2 million, a 19 percent rise from the previous year. That was driven by increases in the subcategories of “violence without injury” (21 percent) and “stalking and harassment” (36 percent) as well as a smaller increase in “violence with injury” (10 percent), the statistical agency said.The agency did not specifically break out terrorism as a subcategory.Beyond the London and Manchester attacks, the police did not report the ethnicity or religion of the criminal offender, as they generally do not. “So there is no evidence that crimes by Islamic radicals have increased,” said Brian Francis, a statistician who specializes in criminology at Lancaster University.Mr. Francis said he believed that “a lot of this increase is the police recording more minor violent crimes — assault without injury — which might in the past have been ignored in their figures.”The statistical agency attributes the 13 percent increase to “a range of factors, including continuing improvements to crime recording and genuine increases in some crime categories, especially in those that are well recorded.”Even Mr. Trump’s suggestion that there has been an overall increase in British crime is disputed.The 13 percent increase reflects the rise in crimes recorded by the police, but a national statistical authority determined in 2014 that police figures were unreliable. As a result, the metric of “police-recorded crimes” is no longer an official statistic.Another yardstick, the Crime Survey for England and Wales, is still considered an official statistic. It shows no change in crimes. As in the United States, crime in England and Wales has steadily declined since the 1990s.The bulletin cited by Mr. Trump also cautions against relying on a year-to-year change in police reports alone to extrapolate a trend.“Police figures cannot provide a good measure of all crime in society, since we know that a large volume of it never comes to their attention,” John Flatley, the head of the statistical agency, said in the release. “The recent increases in recorded crime need to be seen in the context of the overall decline in crime indicated by the Crime Survey for England and Wales.”"
‘Benghazi on Steroids’? Niger Claims Range From Premature to Conspiratorial,"Some of President Trump’s liberal critics are characterizing the Oct. 4 ambush in Niger that killed four American soldiers as “Benghazi on steroids” — a reference to the yearslong partisan uproar over the 2012 attacks on two United States compounds in Libya.A few parallels can be drawn between the incidents. In each, four Americans died at the hands of Islamic extremists. After the Benghazi attacks, the Obama administration struggled to explain exactly what happened, and why. And now, President Trump and his top officials have yet to satisfy questions from Congress about the deaths in Niger, Republicans and Democrats said on Thursday.But popular allegations about Mr. Trump’s role in Niger have ranged from premature to conspiratorial.Liberal blog posts, shared online tens of thousands of times, falsely claim that Mr. Trump sent American troops to Niger to aid Russia. One, for example, reads: “Four U.S. soldiers were killed in Niger two weeks ago, and no one knows what they were doing there — except that it came shortly after Niger curiously signed a military cooperation agreement with Russia.”Russia and Niger did agree in August to “interact in the war on terror, exchange information on military and political issues and the issues of strengthening international security,” according to Tass, Russia’s news agency. But the United States’ presence in Niger predates this agreement by years. In 2013, President Barack Obama announced that American troops had been sent to Niger’s capital, Niamey, to set up a new drone base.An image widely shared on Facebook and Twitter states: “Trump arbitrarily bans Chad with travel ban. Chad withdraws troops fighting ISIS from Niger. ISIS promptly returns to Niger when Chad leaves. Four Green Berets die as a direct result.” But the facts do not support this.Two of the four soldiers killed in the ambush — Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright and Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black — were Green Berets. The two others were Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson and Sgt. La David T. Johnson.Chad was added to Mr. Trump’s updated travel ban in late September. In October — around the same time as the ambush — Chad withdrew troops from the Diffa region of Niger. But these troops were fighting Boko Haram in the east, while the American soldiers were fighting a different Islamic militant group in Tongo Tongo, a village hundreds of miles to the west.“These are two completely different conflicts,” said Laura Seay, a professor of African politics at Colby College. Geography aside, she said, there is little evidence that the militants operating in the west were emboldened by Chad’s withdrawal in the east as “they were carrying out attacks pretty regularly” before the Oct. 4 ambush.Viral social media posts have called the Niger attack “Benghazi on steroids,” pointing to alleged misconduct by the Trump administration.For example, one post that claims the journalist Dan Rather said that “the Trump Pentagon gave these men bad intel, no support, outsourced rescue people.” But there is no evidence that Mr. Rather made these remarks, and many details about the Niger ambush have yet to emerge. The Pentagon and F.B.I. are investigating the operation, including discrepancies between American and Nigerien troops’ accounts about what prompted the attack.Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a news conference on Monday that officials on the ground believed that “contact with the enemy was unlikely” before American forces set out with a Nigerien unit on a routine reconnaissance mission on Oct. 3.“We owe you more information,” General Dunford said, including whether forces had “adequate intelligence, equipment and training” and whether “the pre-mission assessment of the threat in the area” was accurate.The viral posts are correct that a contractor evacuated the bodies of three soldiers killed in action, while the French flew out the wounded. Asked why American troops relied on a contractor for evacuation, Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the director of the Joint Staff, said last week that the United States relied on contract support around the world, but declined to give specifics about the ambush.But it is inaccurate to suggest American troops played no role at all in the rescue mission. They, alongside French and Nigerien troops, searched for Sergeant Johnson until his body was recovered two nights later, General Dunford said.Beyond the allegations about the causes of the deaths, observers like Daily Kos and the conservative commentator S.E. Cupp have pointed to the disparity between the two administrations’ responses to Niger and Benghazi. The Trump administration has been more tight-lipped about the Niger attack than the Obama administration was about Benghazi, though some of the Obama administration’s initial claims turned out to be incomplete.In September 2012, militants linked to the extremist group Ansar al-Shariah attacked the United States diplomatic mission and a C.I.A. installation in Benghazi, killing Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Obama administration officials initially rejected the notion of a premeditated terrorist attack and, in the immediate days that followed, made repeated references to an anti-Muslim video as causing the unrest — a rationale soon revealed to be not entirely accurate.Trump officials, on the other hand, have been largely silent in the three weeks since the Niger ambush. Beyond defending his remarks to Sergeant Johnson’s widow, Mr. Trump said on Wednesday afternoon that he did not specifically order the Niger mission, though he gave generals “the authority to do what’s right so that we win.” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, has repeatedly declined to give details about the raid during news conferences.As for inquiries, the F.B.I. began an investigation two days after the Benghazi attacks, and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing about a month after. Congress conducted eight investigations of the circumstances surrounding the violence in Benghazi, the last of which concluded last year. In the end, lawmakers broadly chided the State Department for being inadequately prepared but did not find any clear misconduct that caused the deaths.The Pentagon said the Niger incident was under investigation six days after the deadly attack. Lawmakers in both the House and Senate were briefed by two senior Pentagon officials about the details of the attack in a classified session on Thursday, and appeared divided along party lines as to whether the deaths could have been avoided.But senators from both parties agreed that their questions have not been answered. “They owe us more information, and I think we’ll get it,” Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, told CNN."
Trump Heads to Asia With an Ambitious Agenda but Little to Offer,"WASHINGTON — President Trump departs on his first trip to Asia on Friday weakened and scandal-scarred, ready to face off against newly empowered Chinese and Japanese leaders in a region increasingly determined to set its course without American direction.The White House is framing the trip as a chance for Mr. Trump to showcase his budding personal relationships with President Xi Jinping of China and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan — a forceful world leader pressing his peers to negotiate fairer trade deals with the United States and to intensify the pressure on nuclear-armed North Korea.But Mr. Trump’s erratic statecraft, compounded by the shadow of the Russia investigation, leaves him in a questionable position to extract concessions from Mr. Xi or even allies like Japan and South Korea. The South Koreans may actually draw closer to the Chinese after settling a dispute  this week over the rollout of an American antimissile system.On the eve of the trip, White House aides also have a more basic concern: putting the 71-year-old president through a grueling 11-day, five-nation marathon that they originally conceived as two separate trips before Mr. Trump opted to do it all at once.While Mr. Trump is skipping a summit meeting of Southeast Asian leaders in the Philippines to head home a day earlier, it will still be the longest tour of Asia by any president since the elder George Bush in late 1991 — a trip that ended in Tokyo when Mr. Bush, tired and ill with the flu, collapsed after vomiting on the Japanese prime minister.In Vietnam, his aides said, Mr. Trump will articulate a new policy for Asia built on the concept of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” region. The idea, they acknowledge, originated with the Japanese, who have been urging the United States to bond with three other maritime democracies — Japan, Australia, and India — to contain a rising China.“This trip is a great opportunity to demonstrate America’s, and the Trump administration’s, commitment to the Indo-Pacific,” said the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, using what seemed likely to become a catchphrase for the Trump administration, much as the “Asia pivot” was for the Obama administration.Japanese officials planted the Indo-Pacific idea with two American counterparts: Brian H. Hook, the State Department’s policy planning director, and Matthew Pottinger, the Asia director in the National Security Council. But it dates further back, to a 19th-century American naval officer and historian, Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose writings about maritime power have long been studied in Japan but who has only recently drawn attention in the White House.The problem is, it is unclear that Mr. Trump is bringing any initiatives to Asia to further that vision. He withdrew the United States from the most obvious regional project, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He is pushing bilateral trade deals to replace that accord, but Japan and other Asian countries are reluctant to open negotiations, while South Korea is balking at Mr. Trump’s demand to renegotiate its existing trade agreement.“When the region looks at Trump, they see uncertainty, they see unpredictability, they see a stepping back from key agreements like TPP,” said Evan S. Medeiros, a former senior adviser on Asia to President Barack Obama. “Asian policymakers have a really hard time understanding if he has a coherent strategy.”And yet, Mr. Medeiros added, “Nobody in Asia can afford to alienate the American president, as unreliable and distasteful as he and his policies may be.”Indeed, Asian leaders are sparing no fanfare for Mr. Trump. Mr. Abe has invited him to play golf in Tokyo on Sunday, reciprocating for a round at Mr. Trump’s resort in Palm Beach, Fla., in February. Mr. Xi is throwing him what officials characterize as a “state visit-plus,” with a tour of the Forbidden City and an inspection of troops.Mr. Trump is bringing 29 chief executives to Beijing, where the administration hopes to announce billions of dollars of new deals for American industry. But officials are playing down expectations that China will agree to any meaningful opening of its markets.In some respects, said Michael J. Green, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Mr. Trump’s visit is more akin to a trade mission by a Dutch prime minister or a French president than a summit meeting of the leaders of two superpowers.Still, Mr. Trump plans to make the North Korea crisis the centerpiece of his stops in Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing. General McMaster said Thursday that the administration was considering putting North Korea on the government’s list of state sponsors of terrorism.In Beijing, Mr. Trump will press Mr. Xi to do more to use China’s influence to curb Pyongyang’s behavior. Among his requests, said a person briefed by the White House, are a total cutoff of purchases of North Korean coal, closing North Korean bank accounts and sending home North Korean workers.“China is definitely doing more,” General McMaster said, “but obviously it’s not enough.”He said Mr. Trump’s relationship with Mr. Xi, nurtured in their meeting at Mar-a-Lago in April, would help the president. But analysts noted that Mr. Xi, who emerged from the recent Communist Party congress as perhaps the most powerful Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping, has less of a reason to avoid friction with Mr. Trump — either over North Korea or trade, where Mr. Trump’s protectionist instincts could antagonize Beijing.Mr. Xi demonstrated his self-confidence by reaching out to South Korea to settle the dispute over the South’s deployment of an American antimissile system on the Korean Peninsula. At one level, that underscored China’s inability to drive a wedge between the United States and its ally.But it also complicated Mr. Trump’s efforts to build a coalition to pressure North Korea, since it more closely aligns the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, who favors diplomatic engagement over threats of military force, with China, which also favors diplomacy.Beyond that, the rapprochement illustrated that Asian nations are finding it harder to resist China’s embrace, especially at a time when the United States seems unpredictable and unreliable.“In Southeast Asia, you see countries tilting toward China, particularly after the American withdrawal from TPP,” said Mr. Green, who served as a top Asia adviser to President George W. Bush. “They’re not switching sides, they’re just hedging.”“It’s not clear what the Southeast Asian part of the trip is about,” he added, “other than Trump forming personal relationships with Southeast Asian leaders, some of whom are problematic.”One of those leaders is Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine president who has ordered extrajudicial killings of thousands of suspected drug dealers. A senior administration official said he and Mr. Trump had a “warm rapport.”In Asia, some experts played down the significance of Mr. Trump’s Russia-related problems.“That’s domestic politics,” said Kunihiko Miyake, a former Japanese diplomat now teaching at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto. “American political leaders, including Mr. Trump, are hopefully wise enough to do their job on an external front even while they have to be more scared domestically.”But others said the mushrooming investigation would deepen doubts about Mr. Trump’s reliability.“It’s a question of optics,” said Richard Javad Heydarian, a political-science professor at De La Salle University in Manila. “The shadow of impeachment will cast doubt on whether Trump can deliver on any major initiative he promises.”Mr. Trump’s performance over the next 11 days could alter that perception, for better or worse, which is why people inside and outside the White House are worried by a schedule that some liken to the deadly forced march of prisoners during World War II.“This is actually two trips jammed together,” said Daniel R. Russel, who served as assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs until March. “Either one would be pretty ambitious. Jammed together, they form a kind of Bataan Death March.”"
Here’s How Trump Has Responded to Recent Attacks,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s labeling of Sunday’s church shooting in Texas as “a mental health problem” reflected a broad pattern in his responses to deadly mass attacks in the United States.In some cases, Mr. Trump has aggressively denounced “radical Islamic terrorism” and demanded a clampdown on immigration. But in others, he has lamented the inevitability of tragedy and focused on the attackers’ psychological problems.“This isn’t a guns situation,” the president said at a news conference in Tokyo on Monday. “This is a mental health problem at the highest level. It’s a very, very sad event.”Here’s a look back at what Mr. Trump has said in the wake of attacks since he announced his candidacy in 2015.Oct. 31, 2017: ManhattanA pickup truck barreled down a bike lane along the Hudson River, killing eight. The driver, the police said, arrived in the United States from Uzbekistan in 2010. Hours after the attack, Mr. Trump said he ordered the Department of Homeland Security to “step up our already Extreme Vetting Program.”A day later, Mr. Trump revealed that the attacker had arrived through the diversity visa lottery. He also called for the death penalty for the man accused of carrying out the attack, Sayfullo Saipov, whom he described as a “terrorist” and an “animal.”Oct. 1, 2017: Las Vegas Mr. Trump called one of the deadliest mass shootings in the United State an “act of pure evil” the morning after a gunman opened fire at a country music concert, killing 58 and wounding hundreds. Asked during an Oct. 3 news conference whether the attacker should have been able to amass such a large collection of guns, which he took to his hotel room, Mr. Trump said that debate should occur “at a later time” and called the shooter “a sick and demented person.”July 7, 2016: DallasAn Afghan war veteran armed with an assault-style rifle killed five police officers in an ambush that lasted hours. The attacker, an African-American, hoped to gun down white officers and “obviously had some delusion,” the police chief said. Mr. Trump called the attack “a coordinated, premeditated assault on the men and women who keep us safe.”June 12, 2016: Orlando, Fla.After pledging allegiance to the Islamic State in a call to the police, a gunman opened fire on a gay nightclub, killing 49 people before being killed in a shootout with the police. The gunman was born in New York to Afghan parents and was twice investigated by the F.B.I. for possible extremist ties.That day, Mr. Trump reiterated his call for an immigration ban on Muslims and said he appreciated the “congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism” and called for “toughness & vigilance.” He then delivered a forceful speech to address what he called “the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.”Dec. 2, 2015: San Bernardino, Calif.Before investigators declared the shooting of 14 people by a married couple a terrorist attack, Mr. Trump labeled it “radical Islamic terrorism” and added: “I mean, you look at the names, you look at what’s happened. You tell me.” Five days after the shooting, he called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the country.”Nov. 27, 2015: Colorado SpringsThree people were killed at a Planned Parenthood center when a gunman opened fire with an assault weapon. The gunman was declared unfit to stand trial in May 2016. Mr. Trump said he had seen “tremendous dislike” for Planned Parenthood at his rallies and called the attacker “an extremist” and “mentally disturbed person” in an NBC interview on Nov. 29.Oct 1, 2015: Roseburg, Ore. Ten people were killed by a 26-year-old gunman at Umpqua Community College. After offering his condolences on Twitter, Mr. Trump suggested shootings were not always preventable in an Oct. 2 interview on MSNBC.“You’re always going to have problems,” he said. “I mean, we have millions and millions of people, we have millions of sick people all over the world.” He added: “Even if you did great mental health programs, people are going to slip through the cracks.”At a campaign rally a day later, Mr. Trump questioned the need for gun-free zones and said that if “you had a couple of teachers with guns in that room, you would have been a hell of a lot better off.”Aug. 26, 2015: Roanoke, Va.A day after a fired television reporter shot and killed two journalists during a live broadcast in Virginia, Mr. Trump rejected calls for tougher gun control and called the shooter “a very sick man” in an interview with CNN. “This isn’t a gun problem,” he said. “This is a mental problem.”July 16, 2015: Chattanooga, Tenn. A gunman who was born in Kuwait but went to high school and college in Chattanooga attacked two military sites, killing four Marines before he was fatally shot by the police. He struggled with mental illness and drug abuse before his rampage, and was deeply critical of American policy in the Middle East. The night of the attack, Mr. Trump called for the end of gun-free zones in an interview with Bill O’Reilly of Fox News and criticized President Barack Obama for not using the phrase “Islamic terrorism.”“It seems so sad that a whole group of people have to be blamed. But it does seem to be happening a lot,” Mr. Trump said.June 17, 2015: Charleston, S.C. Mr. Trump, who declared his candidacy on June 16, offered his condolences on Twitter a day after Dylann S. Roof shot and killed nine people in a historic black church. He later called people’s response to the shooting “one of the more beautiful things I’ve seen in my life.”"
Trump Says Tougher Gun Laws Could’ve Worsened Texas Death Toll,"SEOUL, South Korea — President Trump said on Tuesday that stricter gun laws would not have prevented the shooting in a Texas church that killed 26 people and that they could have driven the death toll into the hundreds, since the gunman was shot by an armed bystander.Mr. Trump was asked during a joint news conference with the president of South Korea whether he would support “extreme vetting” of gun buyers, comparable to the vetting his administration has sought to impose on visitors from some predominantly Muslim countries.“If you did what you’re suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago,” the president replied, “and you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him and hit him and neutralize him.”“If he didn’t have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead,” Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump did not address the fact that the Air Force has said it should have entered the assailant, Devin P. Kelley, into a federal database after he was court-martialed on domestic violence charges years ago. That would have prohibited him from legally buying the military-style rifle he used to kill 26 parishioners on Sunday inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex.Mr. Kelley was shot twice by the armed bystander after he walked out of the church, having finished his killing spree inside. He might have continued his attack elsewhere, but the entire town of Sutherland Springs only has about 600 people.Instead, a wounded Mr. Kelley led the bystander and another man on a dramatic car chase that ended in a crash. He was found dead in his car of what the police said was a self-inflicted gunshot wound.The carnage in Texas has overshadowed Mr. Trump’s trip to Asia, and his response to questions about it has hardened as the questions have kept coming. On Monday in Tokyo, he described the gunman as a “very deranged individual,” saying, “I think that mental health is your problem here.”In Seoul, standing next to President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, Mr. Trump, as he has before, invoked street violence in Chicago as a reason to be suspicious of tighter gun regulations.“The city with the strongest gun laws in our nation is Chicago,” he said, “and Chicago is a disaster. It’s a total disaster.”"
‘Access Hollywood’ Reminds Trump: ‘The Tape Is Very Real’,"The tape, without question, is real.The famed recording of Donald J. Trump making vulgar comments about women while filming a segment for “Access Hollywood,” which was first reported by The Washington Post roughly a month before last year’s presidential election, figured prominently in the final stretch of the race. Its authenticity wasn’t challenged at the time.But Mr. Trump suggested to a senator earlier this year that the tape was not authentic, The Times reported on Saturday, and he recently repeated that contention to an adviser.The claim does not hold up to scrutiny.“Let us make this perfectly clear: The tape is very real,” Natalie Morales, an “Access Hollywood” host, said during Monday’s broadcast. “Remember his excuse at the time was ‘locker room talk.’ He said every one of those words.”Hours after the tape was published last October, Mr. Trump directly acknowledged that it was genuine.“I said it, I was wrong and I apologize,” he said in a video recording.Here is the relevant portion of the transcript.Asked on Monday if the president now questioned the authenticity of the tape, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Trump had “made his position on that clear.”“The president hasn’t changed his position,” she said. “I think if anything that the president questions, it’s the media’s reporting on that accuracy.”It begins with audio of Mr. Trump speaking with Billy Bush, the former “Access Hollywood” host, on a bus. In the section that attracted the most attention, Mr. Trump referred to kissing women and grabbing them by their genitals without their consent.Here is the full transcript.After the recording was published, Mr. Bush was fired from his job on the “Today” show. He has since apologized and said he hopes to return to television."
Trump Sells Tax Plan With False Claims,"WASHINGTON — At a Wednesday afternoon rally in Missouri, President Trump played up what he called the “biggest tax cuts in history” and boasted about economic growth “in a nonbraggadocious way.”“In fact, they’re going to say Trump is the opposite of an exaggerator,” he said of his rosy projections, in a speech full of exaggerations and falsehoods. Here’s an assessment.President Ronald Reagan, who enacted a major tax cut in 1981 and lowered tax rates again in 1986, was hardly the last president to have done so. President Bill Clinton signed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. President George W. Bush enacted two major tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. The stimulus passed under President Barack Obama included hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts, and Mr. Obama later extended the Bush tax cuts with the American Tax Payer Relief Act of 2012.Mr. Trump insisted that the tax bill is “not good for me” or the wealthy. Referring to Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, the president said: “I keep hearing Schumer, ‘This is for the wealthy!’ If it is, my friends don’t know about it.”That is not supported by most analyses of the tax plans being considered in Congress.Under the Senate plan, every income level would receive a tax cut in 2019, but people earning $20,000 to $30,000 annually would face a tax increase the next year, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. By 2027, most people making under $75,000 each year would see a tax increase, while those making more would continue to receive a tax cut.Under the House plan, every income group would see tax cuts through 2027, but the richest one-fifth of Americans would receive 56 percent to almost 75 percent of the cuts, according to the Tax Policy Center.Based on his 2005 tax return, Mr. Trump himself could save more than $1.1 billion under the White House tax framework, according to an analysis by The New York Times, and the same amount under the House plan, a tax expert at Marcum L.L.P. told NBC.Mr. Trump has repeated this claim at least a dozen times since October, but it has not been true of any of the tax plans released in Congress or outlined by his administration.A 2013 Treasury Department report assessed the size of major tax bills either as a percentage of the economy, by the reduction in federal revenue or in inflation-adjusted dollars. The 1981 Reagan tax cut is the largest under the first two metrics. It was equivalent to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product and reduced federal revenue by 13.3 percent. The 2012 Obama tax cut amounted to the largest cut in inflation-adjusted dollars: $321 billion a year.For Mr. Trump’s tax cut to exceed the Reagan cuts as a share of G.D.P., the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates it would need to cost roughly $6.8 trillion over 10 years. To have a larger effect on revenue, it would need to cost $5.7 trillion. No version of the current tax cut plan meets those benchmarks.The budget blueprint that Republicans released in mid-October, the bill passed in the House in November and the bill currently being considered in the Senate all amount to a tax cut of about $1.5 trillion over 10 years. This would place as the 12th-largest as a share of the economy.Mr. Trump spoke of tepid growth before he took office. “In all fairness, the stock market was going this way,” he added, drawing a flat line with his hand. The stock market has hit record highs under Mr. Trump, but the uptick began after the financial crisis in 2008.The link he drew between market performance and G.D.P. growth also contradicts his own comments. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said the economy was “doing terribly” at 1.2 percent G.D.P. growth, which occurred in the first quarter of this year. But during that quarter, he jubilantly posted on Twitter about the stock market’s “longest winning streak in decades.”The Commerce Department adjusted its estimate of G.D.P. growth to 3.3 percent in the third quarter of 2017 from a previous estimate of 3 percent. This is the largest increase in about three years, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The economy grew at 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2015 and at 5.2 percent in the third quarter of 2014, and the increase was larger than 3.3 percent in five other quarters under Mr. Obama."
Al Franken: From ‘Saturday Night Live’ to Congress,"Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, said on Thursday that he plans to resign “in the coming weeks” amid mounting accusations of sexual harassment against him.Mr. Franken, 66, is from St. Louis Park, Minn. Raised in a middle-class household where education was emphasized, he went on to attend Harvard University. In 1969, he met Franni Bryson, his wife of more than 40 years, at a college mixer.A comedian who spent years at “Saturday Night Live,” Mr. Franken reinvented himself as a politician before being felled by a string of harassment allegations in recent weeks.[ALSO READ: Senator Al Franken Resigns]After college, Mr. Franken and a childhood friend, Tom Davis, moved to Los Angeles to try their hand at stand-up comedy. Soon, they caught the attention of Lorne Michaels, who hired them as two of the first writers for “Saturday Night Live,” which began in 1975.After a hiatus from the show in the early 1980s, Mr. Franken’s star rose in the late ’80s and early ’90s with memorable recurring roles, including as the smarmy self-helper Stuart Smalley and as an intrepid journalist known as the one-man mobile-uplink unit.After spending years at “Saturday Night Live,” Mr. Franken turned to writing, publishing the best-selling satire “Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations” in 1996 and  “Why Not Me?” in 1999, a satirical novel about making a fictional run for president.Weeks before its scheduled release, his 2003 book, “Lies, and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right,” reached the top of Amazon’s best-seller list amid publicity surrounding a Fox News lawsuit over his use of the phrase “fair and balanced.”[ALSO READ: In Courtroom, Laughter at Fox And a Victory For Al Franken]“I’d like to thank Fox’s lawyers for filing one of the stupidest briefs I’ve ever seen in my life,” he said at the time.In March 2004, Mr. Franken began hosting the flagship show on the now-defunct liberal talk-radio network “Air America Radio.”Over three hours each day, he would heap scorn and ridicule on Republicans. He mocked Bill O’Reilly — his radio show was initially called the “The O’Franken Factor” — and poked fun at President George W. Bush’s administration. Around that time, he had even begun hinting at a Senate run.[ALSO READ: Comedian for Senator? Don’t Laugh]On Feb. 14, 2007, he signed off on his last show by announcing his candidacy. “I have decided to move on to another challenge,” he told his audience.The Minnesota Supreme Court ended eight months of legal challenges over the results of the November 2008 election and ruled that Mr. Franken had defeated the Republican incumbent, Norm Coleman. Mr. Franken was sworn in a few days later, on July 7.“When you win an election this close, you know that not one bit of effort went to waste,” Mr. Franken said after the court ruling.He was re-elected in November 2014.During his eight years in Congress, Mr. Franken spoke out often about concerns that consumers were risking their security and privacy by using certain electronic devices. In 2011, he and several other senators expressed concern about tracking information that Apple and Google collected on users through their cellphones.In May that year, Mr. Franken pressed executives from Google and Apple during a congressional panel about location information the companies received from cellphones.Mr. Franken took aim at proposed telecommunications mergers during his time in Congress, relishing his role as a congressional opponent to media conglomeration. He opposed the Comcast-NBC Universal merger, which got federal approval in 2011, and the unsuccessful merger of AT&T and T-Mobile.[ALSO READ: Franken’s Campaign Against Comcast Is No Joke]When Comcast sought to take over Time Warner Cable in 2014, Mr. Franken let the company’s executives know that his opposition was not just about his fear of higher prices for consumers. His opposition was also personal, as a New York Times article in April 2014 noted:Mr. Franken was praised among Democrats in January for his questioning of Betsy DeVos during her confirmation hearing to be education secretary. The hearing was heated and partisan, and Mr. Franken had a memorable exchange with Ms. DeVos about education policy.“I would like your views on the relative advantage of doing assessments and using them to measure proficiency or to measure growth,” he asked her.During her response, Mr. Franken cut her off. “It surprises me that you don’t know this issue,” he replied.On Nov. 16, Leeann Tweeden became the first woman to publicly accuse Mr. Franken of sexual harassment. Ms. Tweeden, a Los Angeles newscaster, said he kissed and groped her without consent during a 2006 U.S.O. tour. He apologized almost immediately.By Wednesday, several more women had come forward to accuse Mr. Franken of making unwanted sexual advances.Mr. Franken’s support among his colleagues in the Senate crumbled this week. By Wednesday night, dozens of senators, including nearly all of the Democratic women in the Senate, were calling on him to resign. On Thursday morning, he spoke on the Senate floor, saying he would resign in the coming weeks, though he continued to dispute allegations against him.While Mr. Franken had hoped for vindication from a congressional investigation, he said on Thursday that his remaining in the Senate would be a distraction.“This decision is not about me. It’s about the people of Minnesota,” he said. “It’s become clear that I can’t both pursue the Ethics Committee process and at the same time remain an effective senator for them.”"
Moore’s Rebuke of His Accuser and Other Distortions in Alabama’s Senate Race,"WASHINGTON — At a Friday night rally, President Trump urged supporters to vote for Roy S. Moore, the Republican candidate in an Alabama Senate race who has been accused of sexual misconduct.“How many are people here from the great state of Alabama?” Mr. Trump asked at the rally in Pensacola, Fla., about a half-hour drive from the Alabama border. “Did you see what happened today, you know, the yearbook?”He was referring to a high school yearbook that one of Mr. Moore’s accusers said he signed in 1977. Whether that happened is only one of the disputes over the facts in a Senate campaign filled with inaccurate claims. As the election on Tuesday approaches, here’s an assessment.Beverly Young Nelson told reporters last month that Mr. Moore had sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager after her shift had ended at the Olde Hickory House, a now-defunct restaurant in Gadsden, Ala. She presented a yearbook that she said had been signed by Mr. Moore.On Friday, Mr. Moore shared a Breitbart News article on his Facebook page with the headline: “Bombshell: Roy Moore Accuser Beverly Nelson Admits She Forged Yearbook.” On Twitter, Mr. Moore said Ms. Nelson had been accused of lying by her then-boyfriend, her stepson and employees and customers of the restaurant. “Now she herself admits to lying,” he wrote.These claims are not entirely accurate. Ms. Nelson, in a Friday interview with ABC News, said Mr. Moore had signed the yearbook and she added notes detailing the date and location. She did not admit to forging his signature.Breitbart has reported that neither Ms. Nelson’s stepson nor a man who says he dated Ms. Nelson in high school believes her claims. Those who say they worked at the restaurant or otherwise frequented it have offered differing accounts on whether Mr. Moore was a regular customer.But Mr. Moore has contradicted himself on whether he knew his other accusers. He first told Sean Hannity last month that he remembered Debbie Wesson Gibson and Gloria Thacker Deason, but he has recently claimed at campaign stops that “I do not know any of these women.”Planned Parenthood’s clinics cannot give money to political candidates, and its fund-raising groups are banned from directly donating more than $5,000 to a candidate in an election. Though Planned Parenthood fund-raising groups have donated to other Democratic Senate campaigns, filings to the Federal Election Commission do not reveal contributions to Doug Jones, Mr. Moore’s Democratic rival.Planned Parenthood has not endorsed Mr. Jones, either. However, its “super PAC,” Planned Parenthood Votes, commissioned a poll in November surveying how views on abortion factored into the Alabama race.Mr. Jones has received support in the form of independent expenditures (for example, television ads) worth millions from outside groups. Again, Planned Parenthood is not among them, but they do include the political action committees of a steel union, a civil-rights group and a new group called Highway 31, which has not publicly disclosed its donors.Mr. Jones does support abortion rights but Janet Porter, a spokeswoman for Mr. Moore’s campaign, misrepresented his position in a CNN interview this week.In its landmark 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court legalized abortion up until the fetus is viable or can survive outside the womb, or after that point to protect the health and life of the mother. About a third of states let doctors determine viability, and half limit abortion to a specific time frame. In Alabama, that point is 22 weeks of gestation.Only 1.3 percent of abortions in the United States occur past the first 21 weeks, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research center that supports abortion rights. The situation that Ms. Porter described — an abortion performed just before or on the due date — does not exist.“When a woman is near her due date and has a medical condition that requires ending the pregnancy, the treatment is delivery of the baby,” said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco.Mr. Jones, in an MSNBC appearance on Sept. 27, was asked whether he would oppose legislation banning abortion after 20 weeks. (At the time, the House was considering such a bill.)“I’m not in favor of anything that is going to infringe on a woman’s right and her freedom to choose,” he responded.Mr. Jones clarified his position days later in an interview with AL.com: “The law for decades has been that late-term procedures are generally restricted except in the case of medical necessity. That’s what I support. I don’t see any changes in that. It is a personal decision.” In a December ad, Mr. Jones’s campaign wrote: “Roy Moore co-authored a legal course instructing students that women should not be allowed to run for office. Moore’s course taught that the Bible forbids women from holding elected office and Christians shouldn’t vote for women.”In 2011, Mr. Moore helped write “Law and Government: An Introductory Study Course,” a textbook published by an evangelical Christian organization, according to Think Progress, a left-leaning website. A section of the book contains arguments against women running for office, but it was not personally written Mr. Moore, as the ad suggested.“She’s not a warrior. She’s not a judge. She’s a woman. Created by God. Glorious in her place and in her conduct and in her role,” wrote the author of that section, who was identified by Think Progress by William O. Einwechter. “Nothing is said in Scripture that supports the notion that she is qualified or called to be a civil magistrate.”Mr. Moore’s contributions to the legal course appear to be limited to a lecture detailing the fight over his display of the Ten Commandments in his courthouse. His campaign has denied that he ever voiced opposition to women holding office."
Fingerprints of Russian Disinformation: From AIDS to Fake News,"WASHINGTON — The spurious story line alarmed Americans. It spread like wildfire, distorting facts into outlandish fictions, despite being attributed only to obscure sources. And it inflamed already divisive politics before the United States government concluded — perhaps too late — that it was a Russian disinformation campaign.“We would take any misinformation like that very seriously,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters at a briefing on Monday.Ms. Sanders was responding to a question about how the Trump administration would view a “disinformation campaign by a foreign government” — specifically, fabricated and sensational news distributed by Moscow in the 2016 election. But presidents have for decades dealt with the phenomena of Russian-peddled fake news, if under a different name.It is rooted in a Cold War plot that fanned a conspiracy theory about the origins of AIDS, earning a rebuke from the Reagan administration, and now serves as a lesson about Russian disinformation and the subversion of weighty issues worldwide.“Today, the fingerprints of Russian disinformation campaigns have been left on both sides of the Atlantic,” Mark R. Jacobson, a professor at Georgetown University and former Pentagon adviser, told a congressional hearing in November.“Whether it is ‘Brexit’ or the American election, Russian propaganda still infects U.S. social media networks,” Dr. Jacobson said. “And we see the same sort of divisive propaganda that we saw during the Cold War.”Called Operation Infektion by the East German foreign intelligence service, the 1980s disinformation campaign seeded a conspiracy theory that the virus that causes AIDS was the product of biological weapons experiments conducted by the United States. The disease disproportionately impacts gay men, and the Reagan administration’s slow response had escalated into suspicions in the gay community that the United States government was responsible for its origins.“The K.G.B. picked up on that, and added a new twist with a specific location: Fort Detrick, Md.,” where military scientists conducted biological weapons experiments in the 1950s and 1960s, said Douglas Selvage, the project director at the Office of the Federal Commissioner for Stasi Records in Berlin.The K.G.B. campaign began with an anonymous letter in Patriot, a small newspaper published in New Delhi that was later revealed to have received Soviet funding. It ran in July 1983, under the headline “AIDS May Invade India: Mystery Disease Caused by U.S. Experiments” and pinned the origin of the disease to Fort Detrick.The choice of Patriot was deliberate, said Thomas Boghardt, a military and intelligence historian who traced how the campaign unfolded. “It had no explicit links to the Soviets and was an English-language newspaper easily accessible to a global audience.“The Soviets intuitively understood how the human psyche works,” Dr. Boghardt said. He said the playbook was simple but effective: Identify internal strife, point to inconsistencies and ambiguities in the news, fill them with meaning and “repeat, repeat, repeat.”A September 1985 memo to Bulgarian intelligence from the East German secret police served as a conduit. The disinformation campaign aimed, according to the Stasi, “to generate, for us, a beneficial view by other countries that this disease is the result of out-of-control secret experiments by U.S. intelligence agencies and the Pentagon involving new types of biological weapons.”A month later, the Soviet journal Literaturnaya Gazeta published a paper titled “Panic in the West or What Is Hiding Behind the Sensation Surrounding AIDS.” It included accurate information about the disease and Fort Detrick but cited the Patriot letter to connect the dots.The paper received international attention and its allegations were repeated around the world including in Kuwait, Finland and Peru. CBS News, black newspapers, the gay press, niche publications critical of the C.I.A. and the right-wing presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche all promoted the conspiracy theory. (Mr. LaRouche flipped the claim on its head, accusing the Soviets of using AIDS as a weapon.)It was also cited by former President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa in rejecting antiretroviral drugs to treat AIDS in the 2000s, contributing to at least one public health crisis. The hip-hop artist Kanye West has referenced the conspiracy theory — “And I know that the government administered AIDS,” he rapped in 2005 — in at least two popular songs.The same tactics have shown up in recent years.Birtherism, the homespun conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, was picked up by Russian state news media and then cited by right-wing groups. The so-called Pizzagate scandal, the baseless allegations that John D. Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, abused children in a pizza restaurant, was similarly amplified by Russia accounts.Mr. Selvage said those conspiracy theories would have thrived on their own, even without Russian agitation. He said foreign information warriors simply exploited optimal “operational environments.”“Had U.S. politics not already been polarized, these sort of efforts would have not gotten any traction,” he said. “They’d be whistling in the dark.”Mr. Jacobson likened the AIDS campaign to fake Russian accounts and campaigns like Blacktivist and Black Fist that exploited the Black Lives Matter movement and heightened racial tensions in 2016.The Twitter bots that helped spread viral fake news during the election last year have now morphed into cyborgs, or accounts that blend automation with human curation, said Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher on the Computational Propaganda Project at Oxford University. They are more difficult to identify, but still latch onto divisive issues and seek to deepen the wedge.“The point is not to just tell a lie, but to tell a lie in increments,” Ms. Bradshaw said. “They get a little bit more absurd as you start release more and more stories.”She pointed to the first case of social media disinformation, when Twitter and Facebook users lobbed theories about the disappearance in 2014 of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Rumors of its fate included a natural disaster, Ukrainians trying to assassinate President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and a lost and confused World War II battalion emerging to shoot down the plane.“This was not to convince people about the World War II battalion but telling them to distrust the media because they can’t get the story right in the first place,” Ms. Bradshaw said.The White House, too, has recently attacked the news media for errors by major news outlets. But on Monday, Ms. Sanders said the Trump administration would not compare a foreign government’s disinformation campaign with a reporter’s mistakes.In the case of the AIDS disinformation campaign, a similar argument about uncertainty over the disease’s origins proved beneficial for conspiracy theorists.Jakob Segal, an East German biologist who promoted the Soviet campaign, seized on growing doubts from a theory that the virus had jumped from African green monkeys to humans. He called it “ludicrous” in an 1986 interview with the London Sunday Express and accused the American government of playing it up as a cover-up.By 1987, the Soviets began to sour on the campaign as Moscow’s scientific establishment rebuked it.Secretary of State George P. Shultz also accused Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who was then the leader of the Soviet Union, with hawking “bum dope about AIDS.” Mr. Gorbachev ordered the K.G.B. to stop spreading the conspiracy theory and after the collapse of the bloc, former Soviet intelligence officials owned up to it.“These active measures may be tactically successful, but strategically they fail,” Dr. Selvage said.“In the case of the AIDS disinformation campaign, they were forced to give up on it,” he said. And of election meddling, “if the goal of the Russian government was to get a U.S. government that was favorable to lifting sanctions, it essentially backfired.”Dr. Boghardt had a slightly different take. The approach of disinformation is basic, but “it works,” he said.“Throw enough dirt, and some will stick,” he said. “This is what they’ve internalized. It didn’t win them the Cold War, but it did undermine the credibility of the West and American institutions.”"
Trump’s Aviation Boast Fails to Get in the Air,"WASHINGTON — President Trump claimed undue credit on Tuesday for keeping the skies safe.“Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news - it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record!” Mr. Trump posted on Twitter.Mr. Trump’s claim came on the heels of two reports that there were no fatal commercial passenger jet accidents in 2017; however, there were several fatal crashes involving smaller planes. The Aviation Safety Network said there were 10 fatal charter and cargo plane accidents last year, and To70, a Dutch aviation consulting firm, noted two fatal accidents on regional airliners in Angola and Russia.“President Trump has raised the bar for our nation’s aviation safety and security,” Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, said in a statement. Mr. Shah cited Mr. Trump’s push to privatize air traffic control and the Department of Homeland Security’s guidelines for enhanced screening of passengers and electronics on flights bound for the United States.A bill proposing air traffic control privatization has stalled in Congress, so it is implausible that it had any effect on airline safety — in the United States or anywhere else in the world. The last fatal accident in a passenger plane operated by a domestic airline was in 2009, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, when a commuter plane headed for Buffalo crashed, killing all 49 people on board.The enhanced screenings were meant to deter terrorism, but fatalities on airlines in 2016 largely resulted from crashes, To70 reported.Of the seven fatal accidents that occurred that year — on Somali, Nepalese, Emirati, Egyptian, Bolivian and Pakistani airlines — four were caused by bad weather or technical malfunction and one by a suicide bombing. Two are currently under investigation. None were bound for the United States.Adrian Young, a consultant at To70, called last year’s rate “a case of good fortune” and noted that there is little statistical difference between two accidents and 10 accidents considering there are tens of millions of flights a year.Harro Ranter, the chief executive of the Aviation Safety Network, said he was not surprised by last year’s lower numbers, given that the number of fatal accidents has consistently decreased over the past two decades.“It’s impossible to link the worldwide level of safety directly to recent U.S. policy changes,” Mr. Ranter said. “U.S. efforts have been instrumental to get to where we are today, but it takes years for policy changes to reach effect, and only in conjunction with other efforts by the aviation industry.”"
These Claims About ‘Chain Migration’ Are Not Accurate,"WASHINGTON — “Chain migration,” or family-based immigration, has emerged as a key point of negotiations — and the subject of heated, inaccurate exchanges — as Congress tries to reach a deal on giving legal status to undocumented migrants who arrived in the United States as children, known as Dreamers.President Trump has argued that chain migration has benefited terrorists, while Republican hard-liners say it could reward those who have broken immigration laws. Some Democrats have inaccurately characterized attempts to limit what they call “family reunification.”Here’s an assessment.Under current immigration law, American green card holders can sponsor their spouses and unmarried children for permanent residence. Additionally, United States citizens can petition for residence for their parents, siblings and married adult children.It is implausible that Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the attack in October in Manhattan, enabled 22 to 24 people to immigrate to the United States. He immigrated to the United States in 2010 from Uzbekistan, married another Uzbek immigrant in 2013 in Ohio and fathered three children in the United States. And as a green card holder, he would not have been able sponsor any extended family.Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, an advocacy group that favors more limits on immigration, said he was unsure what Mr. Trump was referring to in Mr. Saipov’s case. But “it’s obviously not the relatives” sponsored by the attacker, Mr. Krikorian said, given the waiting period and limits to family-based immigration.Theoretically, had Mr. Saipov obtained citizenship, he could have petitioned for his parents and three sisters (whose spouses and children under 21 could have also immigrated with them) to gain residency. Even in this hypothetical, it would have taken more than a decade for Mr. Saipov to sponsor 22 to 24 relatives.Because there are numerical limits for family-based immigration each year, there is a long queue for visas. (As of Nov. 1, more than 3.9 million people were waiting in line.) After a petition is filed and approved, would-be immigrants are essentially handed a ticket number called the “priority date” and can only apply for a green card when the State Department calls their number.The waiting period can last a few months to more than two decades, depending on the country of origin, the sponsor’s immigration status and the applicant’s relationship to their sponsor. In January, for example, Uzbek immigrants sponsored by American-citizen siblings could begin to apply for a green card if their priority date was before June 22, 2004, a waiting period of 13.5 years.Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas argued on the Senate floor on Monday that immigrants who came to the United States as children could petition their relatives for green cards, including “the very parents who brought them here, in violation of the law, in the first place.” Representative Dave Brat of Virginia, in an interview this month on Bloomberg, estimated that giving legal status to some 800,000 people who entered the country as part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy could lead to an influx of “three to four million” potential relatives when “multiplied by chain migration.”A spokeswoman for Mr. Brat said the congressman based his estimate on research showing one immigrant could lead to an average of an additional 4.2 people coming to the United States, with higher numbers from South and Central America. That figure comes from a 2008 book on chain migration by Bin Yu, a professor at Rhode Island College.In an interview, Mr. Yu said he believed chain migration also included the American-born children of immigrants, whom he included in his 4.2 immigration multiplier average. It should be noted, however, that people who are born in the United States are generally given American citizenship. By confining so-called chain migration to foreign relatives, Mr. Yu’s research shows that one immigrant could result in the sponsorship of an average of 2.1 additional people.Marta Tienda, a Princeton University professor and an author of a 2013 study that updates Mr. Yu’s work, said it was inaccurate to just apply the estimated multiplier to the Dreamer population. Her study estimated that each immigrant sponsors an even higher average of relatives — 3.45 — but she emphasized that included all immigrant groups and was driven by employment visas holders, who are much likelier to be naturalized and sponsor foreign relatives.“You can’t just multiply by 800,000. That’s crazy,” Ms. Tienda said, adding the average number of relatives sponsored by Dreamers would “absolutely be much lower” than 3.45.To apply for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, immigrants had to be younger than 31 on June 15, 2012, and must have proof of having arrived in the United States before 16. So their children are likelier to be American citizens, and their spouses also legal residents, citizens or Dreamers themselves.If Dreamers are given a pathway to citizenship through legislation, their parents could indeed eventually obtain legal status. But those who entered the United States illegally are required to leave the country and wait three or 10 years before applying for an immigration visa. That’s “a significant barrier most would be unlikely to contemplate,” according to the Migration Policy Institute.Because these factors, the Dreamers would sponsor, on average, about one family member over their lifetime, the institute estimated.Representative Adriano Espaillat of New York characterized chain migration as parents who want to “reunite with their children.” Representative Luis V. Gutiérrez of Illinois defined it as immigrations petitioning for their spouses.Republicans are not suggesting the elimination of family-based immigration, but rather limiting it to a so-called nuclear family — that is, a set of parents and their children.Over the summer, Mr. Trump endorsed a bill sponsored by Mr. Cotton that eliminates family-based immigration for parents, siblings and adult children. But the bill would still allow American citizens and green card holders to sponsor their spouses and children under 21.It also establishes a visa class for foreign parents to visit their children who are American citizens. House Republicans introduced a similar bill on Wednesday that limits family-based green card programs to spouses and children who are minors.In 2013, the Senate passed a bill that also eliminated visas for siblings and married sons and daughters over 31, and instead established a point-based system for their immigration. No Democrat voted against it. Though the House did not consider that legislation, Mr. Gutiérrez was a sponsor of a bill with similar provisions that year, despite characterizing Mr. Trump’s demands to end chain migration and to build a border wall to limit immigration as “ransom.”"
Trump Overstates Government Shutdown’s Effect on the Military,"WASHINGTON — As the Senate raced on Friday to keep the government open, President Trump and other top Republicans are repeatedly — and misleadingly — warning that a shutdown would incapacitate the military.“But if for any reason it shuts down, the worst thing is what happens to our military,” he said later Thursday at the Pentagon.Republican leaders have begun echoing that warning. The speaker of the House, Paul D. Ryan, in an interview on Friday on Fox News, accused Democrats of “legislative hostage-taking. And the collateral damage in this are the men and women in the military.”In fact, contingency plans from the Pentagon as well as past experience show that many parts of the military would continue to operate even if the government is temporarily closed.“The threats never end, and so this department will never shut down,” Dana W. White, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said in December.On Thursday, the House passed legislation to keep the government funded through Feb. 16, but Republicans were struggling on Friday to muster enough votes in the Senate to approve a similar bill before midnight on Friday. That is the deadline to approve a new spending plan — without which certain federal employees would be placed on unpaid furlough.But the Pentagon “will, of course, continue to prosecute the war in Afghanistan and ongoing operations against Al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, including preparation of forces for deployment into those conflicts,” the deputy secretary of defense, Patrick M. Shanahan, wrote in a memo on Thursday.“The department must, as well, continue many other operations necessary for the safety of human life or the protection of property,” he wrote.The memo said that combat missions, training exercises, reconnaissance activities, intelligence gathering, and surveillance and telecommunications centers that are “necessary for national security” would all carry on.Counterterrorism operations and emergency responses to oil spills or fires would also not be affected, the memo said. Military hospitals and medical facilities would remain open, and health care coverage for department employees would not lapse.All active-duty military, including reserve forces, and civilian workers “necessary to carry out or support excepted activities” would continue to work, but would be paid once the government reopens. (Military contractors who provide services under a fully-funded contract that was awarded before the Friday deadline would also remain on the job.)On Friday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis estimated that the shutdown would furlough roughly 50 percent of his civilian work force. That’s 371,000 employees, or about 13 percent, out of a total work force of nearly three million. (There are 1.3 million active-duty troops and 826,000 National Guard and Reserve forces.)But Mr. Mattis warned that maintenance activities and intelligence gathering — operations not likely deemed necessary to national security and exempted by his deputy’s memo — would grind to a halt because of the shutdown.At its peak, the last shutdown in 2013 resulted in the furlough of about 850,000 employees a day, or 40 percent of the federal civilian work force in the executive branch, according to the Office of Management and Budget.That year, the Pentagon also did not furlough more than 1.3 million active military personnel, nor half of its civilian work force. They were paid through the shutdown, even as other federal workers were furloughed. Legislation to do the same this year has been introduced in the House.And as commander in chief, Mr. Trump could also theoretically exempt anyone and activity he wishes to avert the “devastating” effect he claims a shutdown will have."
"How Truthful Was Trump in His First Year? Before His State of the Union, What Our Fact Checks Show","WASHINGTON — As a freewheeling candidate on the campaign trail, Donald J. Trump amassed a long list of promises.Some became rallying cries and signature to his candidacy (“build the wall”). Others reflected conventional Republican policy wishes (repealing the Affordable Care Act). And then there were the unorthodox pledges about how he would comport himself in office, a few probably improvised (“I will never be in a bicycle race”) or doomed from the start (“We won’t tweet anymore — not presidential”).Mr. Trump has described his first year in office as “a year of real change.” Here’s an assessment on his progress on promises about his approach to the presidency.Of the six measures Mr. Trump outlined in his 100-day action plan “to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington,” he has kept his word on two, imposing lifetime bans on White House officials lobbying for foreign governments and requiring the elimination of two regulations for every one enacted.He has also partially fulfilled two pledges. His promised hiring freeze on federal employees was enacted in January 2017, but lifted in April.Additionally, he took a narrowly tailored approach to his pledge to bar White House and congressional officials from lobbying for five years after leaving office. Rather than a blanket restriction, his executive order specified that White House officials could not lobby the agencies they served, and did not cover congressional officials.But he has not taken any action on two other promises. Mr. Trump has yet to propose term limits for members of Congress or enact a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.Mr. Trump, a billionaire, vowed to not take “even one dollar” of his $400,000 annual salary as president, following in the footsteps of presidents like John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover.So far, he has kept his word, donating his paychecks to the National Park Service in the first quarter of 2017, the Education Department in the second, and then the Health and Human Services Department in the third to help combat the opioid crisis. The White House would not answer questions about what Mr. Trump would do with his paychecks in the fourth quarter of last year.As the first presidential candidate in decades to refuse to release his tax returns, Mr. Trump repeatedly vowed to do so once his Internal Revenue Service audit was complete.The pledge was flawed to begin with. Though tax lawyers may advise against it, the I.R.S. has said that an audit does not prevent individuals from releasing their own tax information. The Trump campaign also released a letter from his lawyers that said Mr. Trump’s tax returns, before 2009, were “closed administratively” — or no longer subject to an audit.But in May, Mr. Trump reneged on the promise in an interview with The Economist, moving the release date to “after I’m out of office.”After incessantly chastising President Barack Obama for golfing, Mr. Trump promised during the campaign that “because I’m going to be working for you, I’m not going to have time to go play golf.” He later made an exception for “leaders of countries and people who can help us.”Yet Mr. Trump has played more golf than his predecessor, according to independent trackers.The White House has repeatedly declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s golf partners. While he played a round with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan in February, he was also accompanied by professional golf players, not world leaders, for at least four games.Mr. Trump pledged to “not be a president who took vacations” and blasted Mr. Obama for his own personal trips.In a 2012 report, the Congressional Research Service concluded that the president is “always on duty” and that his vacations are considered official travel.Over the past year, Mr. Trump has taken some R&R. He spent 17 days in at his golf club in New Jersey, which the White House labeled a “working vacation,” and voyaged to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for a holiday respite that included presidential duties.It is unclear how those trips were different from the vacations that Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Obama for taking. The former president, for example, spent holidays in Hawaii — a frequent talking point of Mr. Trump’s — where he played golf, received intelligence briefings and visited troops.Over all, Mr. Trump has visited a Trump property one out of every three days since taking office."
Oprah Had Ruled Out Running for President,"It was a speech that inspired the fantasies of Democrats across America, all of them centered on a single question: Will Oprah Winfrey run for president in 2020?Now, less than two weeks after those hopes were raised, an interview has appeared to dash those hopes — or at least muddy the waters.In an interview for the March issue of InStyle, the beauty and fashion magazine, the former talk show host was asked how she felt about the prospect of what would have been a historic campaign to put a black woman in the White House. The interview was conducted three weeks before her speech at the Golden Globes, InStyle confirmed Thursday.“I’ve always felt very secure and confident with myself in knowing what I could do and what I could not,” she said. “And so it’s not something that interests me. I don’t have the DNA for it.”But that doesn’t mean she wasn’t toying with the idea.“I met with someone the other day who said that they would help me with a campaign,” she told the magazine. “That’s not for me.”Ms. Winfrey, a television icon, film producer and actress, sparked questions about a potential run when she delivered a stirring acceptance speech for a lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes on Jan. 7.The speech touched on racism and sexism in America and concluded on a hopeful note.“I want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon,” she said. “And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say, ‘Me too’ again.”Almost instantly, her fans began wondering, only some of them in jest, if the speech was a prelude to something bigger.Stedman Graham, her longtime partner, did nothing to dissuade them when, in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, he said she would “absolutely do it,” though he prefaced it by saying that the decision was “up to the people.”In her, some Democrats saw a candidate who could turn out crucial voters — women and African-Americans — while driving few others away.Ms. Winfrey herself had expressed a desire to associates in recent months to play a role in uniting the country, two people briefed on her thinking told The Times. And while she may not ultimately do so by running for president, Ms. Winfrey may be able to pursue that goal through other means.“I have to say the core of me is about conversations. Exploring the depth of our human experiences. That is what I do. That is my calling,” she told the magazine. “Whether I do that through dramas, producing stories with OWN [Oprah Winfrey Network], or one-on-one conversations that matter, I know that’s what I’m here to do.”"
"Mitt Romney Announces Senate Run, Saying Utah ‘Has a Lot to Teach’ Washington","In a long-expected announcement, Mitt Romney said on Friday that he would run for the United States Senate, pledging to bring Utah’s priorities of balanced budgets, strong economy and welcoming borders to Washington.Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts and the 2012 Republican nominee for president, made the announcement in a two-minute video posted to Twitter and Facebook. He cited his experience as the chief executive of the organizing committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and compared Utah, where his mother was born, favorably to the nation’s capital.“Utah has a lot to teach the politicians in Washington,” he said, contrasting the state’s balanced budgets and positive export-to-import-ratio to Washington’s.And, in a pointed gesture toward the restrictive immigration policies of President Trump, he noted that “Utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the world,” while “Washington sends immigrants a message of exclusion.”Last month, The New York Times reported that Mr. Romney had said privately that he was planning a Senate campaign. “I’m running,” he texted a close friend, Kem Gardner.He would replace Senator Orrin G. Hatch, who announced in early January that he would retire at the end of the year.Mr. Romney is popular in Utah, despite not having been born in the state and having spent much of his life elsewhere. (He and his wife, Ann, once kept a vacation home in Park City and in 2013, built a mansion in Holladay, a suburb of Salt Lake City.) He is one of the most prominent Mormons in American public life, a political advantage in a state where the population is about 60 percent Mormon and many civic and business leaders attend the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Romney’s running mate in 2012, endorsed him in a statement on Friday, saying, “Our party and our country are always better off when Mitt is engaged.”Mr. Trump had pleaded with Senator Hatch, the longest-serving Senate Republican, to run for an eighth term, and Mr. Romney’s video underscored the potential for continuing clashes between himself and the president. The clip took several barely veiled shots at Mr. Trump’s policies and manner, as well as the ever-coarsening state of political discourse on Washington’s Capitol Hill.“On Utah’s Capitol Hill,” he said, “people treat one another with respect.”During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Romney decried Mr. Trump as a “fraud” and a “phony,” and said that he was “playing the American public for suckers.” But after the election, he embarked on a more cordial relationship with the president, as his name was one of several in the discussion of possible nominees for Secretary of State. After the violent events in Charlottesville, Va., last summer, he again changed his approach, imploring the president to apologize for saying that there had been blame on both sides.“What he communicated caused racists to rejoice, minorities to weep, and the vast heart of America to mourn,” he said in a Facebook post in August.The two have talked more recently, but Mr. Trump has not offered his support for Mr. Romney’s campaign. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the announcement.Mr. Romney is well-known to many Americans, having run for president twice, once in 2008 and again in 2012, when he faced Barack Obama as the Republican Party’s nominee. After losing, he remained relatively visible, first with the debut of the 2014 documentary “Mitt,” an intimate look at his campaigns that made Mr. Romney seem less awkward and ill-at-ease than he often had while campaigning, and then with his comments about Mr. Trump in 2016."
"Trump on His Hair: ‘I Try Like Hell to Hide That Bald Spot, Folks’","For as much time as is spent trying to figure out what’s inside President Trump’s head, what’s on top of it has attracted less significant scrutiny but a fair bit of curiosity.On Friday, he lifted the veil. So to speak.Appearing at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., the president poked fun at his own mop, a tangle of twists and turns that coalesce in what, in the end, becomes an apparent full head of hair.But if you look within, the president said, not all is as it seems. As Mr. Trump was speaking, a television monitor, showing him on the stage, caught his eye.“What a nice picture that is,” he said. “Look at that. I’d love to watch that guy speak.”The crowd roared. Then, as many people would do when they suddenly realize they’re being looked at, he considered how his hair looked. He hovered his hands over his multi-angled locks, turned his back to the crowd to show off his solid-gold covering like a tarp keeping the rain out, then briefly touched the edges over his neck.Facing the crowd again, he opened up.“Oh, I try like hell to hide that bald spot, folks. I work hard at it,” he said. “It doesn’t look bad. Hey, we are hanging in, we are hanging in, we are hanging in there. Right? Together, we are hanging in.”It’s not always easy to hide bald spots, especially when you’re a president, considering one of your duties is to climb the windy stairs to Air Force One with cameras watching every step. One such video created a stir on the internet in early February, leaving no doubt that there was some heavy combing going on.It’s no secret that Mr. Trump’s hair isn’t what it once was. His longtime doctor, Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, said in early February that the president takes Propecia, a prostate-related drug that promotes hair growth. The one-a-day pill is a common treatment for male-pattern hair loss, and is better at halting hair loss than regrowing what’s already been lost.Mr. Trump’s hair frequently came up as a discussion point during the presidential campaign, but he strongly denied rumors that he would wear a wig or other fake dos.“Maybe they don’t like my hair — which is real, by the way. Look at that,” he said at a campaign event in June 2015, running his hands through his locks. He then motioned a woman onto the stage, asking her: “Is that sucker real?”She touched his hairline and said: “It’s thin, but it’s real.”In August 2015, he invited a woman in the crowd at one of his events to yank on his hair.“I don’t wear a toupee — it’s my hair,” he said.And the late-night television host Jimmy Fallon famously ran his hands through the candidate’s hair in September 2016, an act Mr. Fallon has come to see as a setback. But nothing fell out (or off)."
Nancy Pelosi Wants to Lead. House Democratic Candidates Aren’t So Sure.,"WASHINGTON — A few hours after Conor Lamb, the Pennsylvania Democrat, claimed victory in a House race with a vow to oppose his party’s leader, Nancy Pelosi, the once-and-perhaps-future speaker was explaining to a group of female congressional candidates why she did not retire after 2016.She intended to do so after Hillary Clinton won, Ms. Pelosi recalled Wednesday at a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reception here. But she stayed to ensure Washington had at least one woman in power.To some lawmakers in the room who described her remarks, the message was clear: Ms. Pelosi is not going anywhere — a point she underscored in an interview.Yet her resolve is at odds with growing numbers of Democratic candidates who view her as politically toxic and are pledging to vote against her as their leader, as Mr. Lamb did without suffering consequences with voters and donors. These candidates and some current House Democrats — tired of years of attack ads invoking Ms. Pelosi as a “San Francisco liberal,” and impatient to see a younger set of leaders take power — are now openly distancing themselves from Ms. Pelosi or declaring outright that it is time for her to go.Mr. Lamb, by coming out early against Ms. Pelosi and scoring an upset win in a district President Trump carried by nearly 20 percentage points, has clearly emboldened some other Democrats to follow suit and disavow her. Republicans intend to make Ms. Pelosi’s unpopularity a centerpiece of their 2018 strategy, hoping that her polarizing status will mitigate their predicted losses.Anticipating this strategy from the right, Democratic candidates are increasingly opposing her as speaker or refusing to take a stand as an act of political inoculation — a trend that even her allies acknowledge could ultimately imperil her grip on the Democratic caucus.At least two other senior Democrats, Representatives Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland and Joseph Crowley of New York, are already actively laying the groundwork to seek the leader’s job if Ms. Pelosi’s position becomes untenable.As Democratic House candidates descended on Washington last week for a round of training and fund-raising, the topic of how to confront the Pelosi question came up repeatedly, according to multiple officials.“I was just in D.C. and that’s the advice everybody gives: Don’t say you’re for Pelosi,” recalled former Representative Brad Ashford, a Nebraska Democrat trying to reclaim his seat. (He would not rule out backing Ms. Pelosi.)Most ominous for Ms. Pelosi, it is not just centrist candidates running in red-tinged districts who are reluctant to embrace her, but also political insurgents on the left who see her as an embodiment of the Washington establishment.“I would have to see who’s running,” said Marie Newman, a progressive Democratic House candidate in Illinois, when asked if she would support Ms. Pelosi for speaker. Ms. Newman is vying to unseat Representative Daniel Lipinski, a conservative Chicago Democrat, in a primary there on Tuesday.And on Capitol Hill, Ms. Pelosi, 77, must contend with colleagues from her own generation who want their turn in charge, as well as younger Democrats who’d prefer to clear out the party’s entire septuagenarian leadership team: beyond Ms. Pelosi, the other two ranking House Democrats, Mr. Hoyer and James E. Clyburn, are 78 and 77.Yet at a time when women are at the forefront of the opposition to Mr. Trump’s presidency — volunteering, donating and running for office in record numbers — the specter of Democrats taking back the House only to unceremoniously dump the most powerful woman in American politics strikes many in the party as outrageous.And Ms. Pelosi herself is plainly in this camp.“I’m a woman at the table,” she said in the interview Friday before getting on a plane for Houston, where she was going to raise money for House Democrats at the annual rodeo there.Demonstrating the swagger that delights her admirers and prompts eye-rolling from detractors, Ms. Pelosi said Democrats needed her in charge.“I am a master legislator, I am a shrewd politician and I have a following in the country that, apart from a presidential candidate, nobody else can claim,” she said.While she would not firmly commit to seeking the speakership again, it is clearly her plan, and she even gave voice to a concern on the minds of many Democrats: the chaotic scramble that would ensue if she steps down.“If I was to walk away now, this caucus would be in such a musical chairs scenario,” she said.Even as energy on the left has soared across the country thanks to Mr. Trump, tensions among House Democrats are brewing inside the Capitol. Should Democrats fail to reclaim the House in a year with so many factors in their favor, Ms. Pelosi and her long-serving lieutenants will almost certainly be pushed to step down.Yet some in the caucus want to see new leadership no matter what. Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, hosted Mr. Crowley at a St. Patrick’s Day-themed event last week and unexpectedly announced that he would back Mr. Crowley for leader. Mr. Pascrell, 81, said the culture of the House was changing.“A lot of new people will be coming in and I think we should start fresh,” Mr. Pascrell said, adding almost apologetically of Ms. Pelosi: “She’s taken a lot of crap from Republicans and Democrats and she’s really been above it all.”Representative Filemon Vela, a Texas Democrat, said he had also encouraged Mr. Crowley to run for speaker.“Having Joe be the leader of this party next session would be a welcome change,” said Mr. Vela, 55, adding that Ms. Pelosi “hurts our candidates” in competitive districts.For his part, Mr. Crowley has been inviting groups of younger lawmakers to meet for coffee and pastries in his office, reaching out to high-profile newer members like Joaquin Castro of Texas and Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts.In an interview, Mr. Crowley declined to rule out taking on Ms. Pelosi. Asked if he was seeking commitments for a future race, Mr. Crowley said only that “I have been talking to my colleagues about what they and we can do to help put us in the majority.”Ms. Pelosi dismissed the idea of a challenge from Mr. Crowley, who briefly considered challenging her after the 2016 election, and her aides pointedly noted that at an event in New York last week, he introduced her as “soon to be speaker again.”Mr. Hoyer, in turn, has pitched himself to colleagues as a transitional House speaker, according to multiple lawmakers who have spoken with him — a steady hand through the 2020 elections, and perhaps no further. Katie Grant, his spokeswoman, said he was “focused on taking back the House.”Part of Ms. Pelosi’s challenge owes to the changing nature of fund-raising: Mr. Lamb raised over $4 million from mostly online contributors, the same way other Democrats are attracting donations. That has raised questions about just how much Ms. Pelosi’s vaunted fund-raising prowess still matters.“It weakens the leverage of party leaders,” Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who challenged Ms. Pelosi after the 2016 elections, said of the new fund-raising tools.Yet some Democrats predicted that if the party rides an electoral wave back to power, Ms. Pelosi would reap much of the credit.“If we take the majority, I completely assume that Leader Pelosi will be Speaker Pelosi,” said Representative Karen Bass, Democrat of California.The most plausible scenario for Ms. Pelosi to exit, Democrats believe, is one in which the party just barely wins control of the House. A number of new lawmakers would have pledged not to vote for her, and several Democrats oppose her as a matter of routine, potentially denying her the 218 votes needed to secure the speakership.“I think it will be left up to the new membership,” said Representative John Lewis of Georgia, noting that freshman lawmakers and the rest of the caucus should “work their will.” That could doom Ms. Pelosi, especially if more Democrats follow Mr. Lamb’s approach.At least three of the Democrats’ “red to blue” candidates — recruits designated as top priorities by the D.C.C.C. — have signaled they would prefer a leader other than Ms. Pelosi. In Minnesota, Dean Phillips, a wealthy businessman challenging Representative Erik Paulsen, a Republican, has called for a “new generation of leadership.” In Washington State, Lisa Brown, a former state senator who is challenging Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the Republican leadership, said “there’s room for new blood in all the caucuses in Congress.”And Paul Davis, who is running for an open seat in Kansas, is flatly opposed to Ms. Pelosi. He said a change was “badly needed” and lamented leaders who are “toxic in this part of the country.”But there is unease with Ms. Pelosi in solid-blue districts, too. In two Boston-area districts, neither the Democratic incumbents nor their more progressive rivals have committed to backing Ms. Pelosi. Brianna Wu, a liberal activist opposing Representative Stephen F. Lynch in a Democratic primary, said she was worried Democrats would suffer from Ms. Pelosi’s “inability to express a vision for the party.”Representative Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a moderate Democrat, said he had encouraged other congressional hopefuls to oppose Ms. Pelosi if necessary.“I have liberals back home, the one thing they really like about me is the fact that I voted against Nancy,” he said. “No matter what candidate you are, it’s not necessarily a bad message.”"
Mississippi Governor Defies White House With His G.O.P. Appointee to Senate,"WASHINGTON — Phil Bryant, the Republican governor of Mississippi, defied a last-minute appeal from the White House and announced Wednesday that he was appointing Cindy Hyde-Smith, the state’s agricultural commissioner, to fill the seat Senator Thad Cochran is vacating next month.Appearing at an outdoor rally in Brookhaven, Miss., Ms. Hyde-Smith’s hometown, Mr. Bryant said the decision had been “mine and mine alone” and urged the state’s voters to rally to her side ahead of the special election for the seat this November.Ms. Hyde-Smith, who would be the first woman in the Senate representing Mississippi — the only state that has not had a female governor or member of Congress — used her remarks to outline her accomplishments in office. Aware that Mr. Trump is uneasy about the strength of her candidacy, she also repeatedly invoked and praised the president, made a reference to his signature slogan (“Make America Great Again”) and recalled she had served on his agricultural advisory team.And she made an oblique but unmistakable reference to her coming race against State Senator Chris McDaniel, the firebrand conservative who nearly ousted Mr. Cochran in 2014 and is challenging Ms. Hyde-Smith for the seat.“I feel the power of prayer and that armor of protection on me ’cause we’re going to have some rough days ahead,” said Ms. Hyde-Smith, standing alongside Mr. Bryant at a veterans’ museum.Noting that someone had pointed out that she recently got a haircut, she said: “But I tell you what, I’m not like Samson: I haven’t lost my strength.”Still, she and Mr. Bryant must convince Mr. Trump of her fortitude.In a telephone call Tuesday, White House officials urged the governor not to rush the appointment and expressed concern that Ms. Hyde Smith, a former Democratic state senator who only became a Republican in 2010, could prove vulnerable to attacks from Mr. McDaniel, according to Republicans familiar with the discussions. But the governor — who as of Wednesday morning had not spoken to Mr. Trump himself — is wary of giving Mr. McDaniel an open playing field and moved forward with naming Ms. Hyde-Smith.The president and his top advisers worry about giving Mr. McDaniel an opening with a weak appointee and are uneasy about the possibility of a replay of last year’s special Senate election in Alabama, when they were saddled with Roy S. Moore as their nominee. That paved the way for a Democrat, Doug Jones, to win a Senate seat in the Deep South.It was precisely this recent history that prompted White House officials to express initial concern about Ms. Hyde-Smith last week and again on Tuesday. But it is not just Mr. Trump’s advisers who are nervous: Other Mississippi Republicans also believe Mr. McDaniel has now been given an opening.“This was Governor Bryant’s choice to make,” said Brad White, Mr. Cochran’s chief of staff and a veteran state operative. “Now it’s up to him to elect her.”In a statement issued after the announcement, Mr. McDaniel invoked Ms. Hyde-Smith’s history.“They can choose from among the Democratic candidates or they can vote for a lifelong conservative Republican,” he said of Mississippi voters.Mr. McDaniel also claimed that Mr. Bryant had “dutifully followed the orders of” Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader and a frequent target of conservative anger.Mr. McConnell has been far more sanguine about the appointment than the White House. Officials close to the senator said he would have preferred that Mr. Bryant appoint himself, but that Ms. Hyde-Smith’s Democratic past was being overblown in a state where many conservatives have changed parties in recent years. It is also not lost on Republican leaders in Mississippi and Washington, D.C., that Mr. Trump himself was not a Republican until shortly before he decided to run for president.For his part, Mr. Bryant favored Ms. Hyde-Smith for reasons relating to both politics and personal affinity. He views her as a rural populist in his own fashion. And he has told allies he believes she would excite voters in a way that a more typical Republican officeholder in Jackson, the state capital, would not, and he views her deep connections in the farming communities as significant political assets.A cattle farmer, she was first elected to the State Senate in 2000 and rose to become chairwoman of the Agriculture Committee before winning her current office in 2011.Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell both urged Mr. Bryant to appoint himself to the seat, specifically invoking the Alabama debacle. But Mr. Bryant had no appetite to go to Washington and neither did Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican who is hoping to succeed the governor in next year’s election.Mr. Bryant was eager to fill the vacancy in part because Mr. McDaniel last week gave up his primary challenge against Senator Roger Wicker, an incumbent Republican up for re-election, to run for Mr. Cochran’s seat.Mr. McDaniel, 45, has made his desire for the appointment clear, but the governor responded last week by saying he would not reward the state senator, who has become a thorn in the side of Mississippi’s Republican establishment.“This opportunistic behavior is a sad commentary for a young man who once had great potential,” Mr. Bryant said.Mr. McDaniel’s supporters — some of whom signed an open letter to Mr. Trump on Wednesday urging him not to endorse Ms. Hyde-Smith — expressed their frustration at the decision of the governor.“He seems to be defying the will and the want of the 184,000 conservative Mississippians who voted for Senator McDaniel four years ago,” said Mayor Hal Marx of Petal, a Republican.There is no primary in the special election. If no candidate garners a majority, the top two overall vote-getters will face off in a runoff later in November. What concerns some Republicans is that Mr. McDaniel’s following on the right could, in a potentially crowded field, earn him a position in the runoff against a Democrat.And Mr. McDaniel, who has a history of making incendiary comments, would be more at risk of losing than a less-controversial Republican. What makes establishment-aligned Republicans even more nervous is the prospect that former Representative Mike Espy could emerge as the other candidate in the runoff.Mississippi’s first black congressman since Reconstruction, Mr. Espy has deep ties to both Democrats and Republicans in the state.Still, if Ms. Hyde-Smith’s partisan history could make her vulnerable on the right, it could conceivably appeal to moderate voters and even Democrats.What could prove most problematic for Ms. Hyde-Smith, though, is if additional Republicans enter the race, making it easier for Mr. McDaniel to emerge as the party’s top vote-getter in the first balloting.“I think the mood is of some apprehension because everybody understands how high the stakes are,” said State Representative Greg Snowden, the second-ranking Republican in the Mississippi House, who repeatedly expressed his support for the governor. “I don’t think anybody is under an illusion that it’s going to be an easy race.”"
"Denounced by His Party as a Nazi, Arthur Jones Wins Illinois G.O.P. Congressional Primary","Arthur Jones, a Holocaust denier described as a Nazi by the Illinois Republican Party, won the Republican primary on Tuesday in the state’s Third Congressional District, a heavily Democratic district that includes part of Chicago and its suburbs, according to The Associated Press.Mr. Jones, 70, unsuccessfully sought the nomination five times before, and his victory on Tuesday was a foregone conclusion after the Republican Party failed to draft another candidate to enter the race against him.“Even if only myself and my wife voted for me, I’d win the primary because the Republican Party screwed up big time,” Mr. Jones said in an interview.The Illinois Republican Party has sought to distance itself from Mr. Jones in recent weeks, blanketing the district with campaign fliers and robocalls urging voters to “stop Illinois Nazis,” according to a robocall script provided by the party. Mr. Jones said he had received three robocalls himself.“Arthur Jones is not a real Republican — he is a Nazi whose disgusting, bigoted views have no place in our nation’s discourse,” Tim Schneider, the Illinois Republican Party chairman, said in a statement. He said the party had urged voters “to skip over his name when they go to the polls” and moving forward planned on “vehemently opposing Jones with real campaign dollars.”A spokesman for the Illinois Republican Party said those dollars would be used to support an independent candidate in the November general election. Party leaders are in talks with several potential candidates, the spokesman said, but have not yet decided which one to endorse.The Third Congressional District of Illinois has not been represented by a Republican since 1975, and few people, besides Mr. Jones, believe he has a chance of winning the general election in November. Daniel Lipinski, a Democrat, has represented the district in Congress since 2005, and before that it was represented by his father, Bill Lipinski, since 1993.The main political battle in the district this year has been a Democratic primary between Representative Lipinski and a progressive challenger, Marie Newman, 53. Both have denounced Mr. Jones.Mr. Lipinski, 51, called Mr. Jones’s beliefs “bigoted and anti-Semitic” and said they “personally disgust me because I believe that every individual has a God-given right to be treated with dignity.”Erik Wallenius, Ms. Newman’s campaign manager, said Mr. Jones’s views were “abhorrent and have no place in the Third District, or anywhere.”Mr. Jones is a former member of the American Nazi Party and has been active in the white supremacist movement for years. As a student at the University of Wisconsin, Mr. Jones said, he founded a conservative campus newspaper and attended meetings of both the Young Republicans and a Nationalist Socialist student group.He later ran for mayor of Milwaukee as a member of the National Socialist White People’s Party in 1976. He finished fourth in the nonpartisan primary, receiving roughly 5,000 votes, and moved to Illinois the following year, he said.“This stuff about being a Nazi, that’s in the past,” Mr. Jones said on Monday. But his campaign website contains a page devoted to the Holocaust, which he said in an interview was “a greatly overblown nonevent” and “an international extortion racket.”Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said Mr. Jones was just one of several extremists running for public office this year. He pointed to Paul Nehlen, whose primary bid against the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, was denounced by the Wisconsin Republican Party last month, and Joe Arpaio, the immigration hard-liner pardoned by President Trump, who said in January that he was running for United States Senate in Arizona.“It is just nuts that we are in this moment in time when we have intolerance really infecting our political process,” Mr. Greenblatt said.Mr. Greenblatt pointed to an uptick in far-right recruiting on college campuses and a 57 percent increase in the number of anti-Semitic incidents over the last year as signs that “extremists feel emboldened” in the current political climate.“It is a sad state, where we are,” Mr. Greenblatt said. “This is a bigger problem than Arthur Jones.”"
"Beyond Gun Control, Student Marchers Aim to Upend Elections","On Saturday, Rebecca Schneid plans to pull on her sneakers, sling a camera over her shoulder and march down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington with thousands of other students demanding an end to the gun violence that has cut through so many American communities.But to Ms. Schneid, a survivor of the school shooting that killed 17 people last month in Parkland, Fla., the march is just the beginning — a moment of political awakening, she hopes, that will put the nation on notice that young people plan to be a greater, more organized force than teenagers and college students in the past.“It’s going to look like millions and millions of people,” said Ms. Schneid, 16, who is the editor of the newspaper at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. “And it’s going to look scary to politicians.”With more than 800 student-led demonstrations planned in the United States and internationally, the organizers of the March for Our Lives are aiming for a generational show of strength by a diverse movement united in a conviction that adults have failed them.Still, for all their fierce energy, these liberal-leaning activists have yet to be tested in the arena of electoral politics. They face a political system that is historically resistant to major change, and a Republican president and Congress with a strong base of support among much older voters, many of whom have more conservative views on guns.A major moment will come in the 2018 midterm elections: Some students will be eligible to vote in November, and have vowed to make gun laws a central issue. Many more hope to organize networks and lay groundwork to vent their frustration — about pervasive school violence, and an unjust political system they view as enabling it — in the next vote for president in 2020.Whether the students of the post-Parkland movement become a disruptive force depends, in large part, on if they stay organized and register to vote. There is a big practical difference between tuning into politics and actually voting, political strategists and organizers say, and young people often vote at lower rates than older ones, especially in midterm elections.Page Gardner, president of Women’s Voices Women Vote Action Fund, a Democratic-aligned group that focuses on mobilizing young people, minorities and single women, said the big question was whether teenagers’ activism would translate into votes. The gun issue, she said, had become a focal point for young people who are “just fed up” with the way government works now.“They do think the system is rigged; this is just an example of it,” Ms. Gardner said of the gun issue. “They want to change it. Whether or not they register and vote to change it, is obviously the $64 million question.”The students have come of age during a time of political tumult — starting with President Trump’s election and erupting in a new and more focused way with last month’s school shooting. Having already reignited the political debate around guns, they believe they have the potential to bend the ideological and partisan lines of American politics more decisively as they join the electorate.Lane Murdock, 15, a high school student in Connecticut who is organizing a wave of school-walkout protests on April 20, said the combination of the gun massacres and Mr. Trump’s surprise win had jarred her out of political complacency.“We were raised to let the adults do the work,” said Ms. Murdock, who is traveling to Washington to join the march there. “When I was growing up and Obama was president, I didn’t pay much attention to politics.”She called Mr. Trump’s election a turning point: “I think kids are frustrated that they really couldn’t have a say.”A number of the most prominent young activists from Parkland have already become familiar faces in Washington, and several arrived in the city early on Thursday to meet with students at Thurgood Marshall Academy, a school in Anacostia, a predominantly African-American neighborhood, to discuss gun violence.Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who has been meeting regularly with high school-age activists, said they stood out from other groups in their scorn for the political status quo. Mr. Murphy, who became a fierce advocate for gun control after the murder of 20 children in a 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., said he had urged the students to dig in for a long fight, on a historic scale — “like the Civil Rights movement or the anti-Vietnam War movement.”“These kids are impatient,” said Mr. Murphy, who at 44 is one of the Senate’s youngest members. “This is a generation that is used to demanding immediate gratification, and they want it politically, too.”The March for Our Lives is likely to echo other mass demonstrations that have sprung up since Mr. Trump’s election. Like the Women’s March, it is to be anchored in Washington with speeches from students from around the country, and complemented by satellite rallies in cities and towns as large as Los Angeles and as small as Pinedale, Wyo.The National Park Service has approved a permit for the Washington march that estimates 500,000 people could attend, which would make it one of the most impressive displays of collective political will since the last presidential election — and the only one in which many or most of the participants have never been able to vote.Marchers like Madison Leal, however, are aching to start.Ms. Leal, 16, a student from Stoneman Douglas, said she would hold a sign at the march bearing 17 blood-red hands and the message: “How many more?” If elected officials do not act, Ms. Leal said, “I’m going to vote them out of office.”“And so is my entire generation,” she added. “And they’ll be sorry then.”Among some participants, the determination to defy an indifferent political system mingles with a persistent fear of disappointment. Dantrell Blake, 21, who was shot as a teenager in Chicago and plans to march in Washington, said he hopes to draw attention to gun violence in his hometown but knows that politicians could ignore the message. The mostly black victims of gun violence in Chicago, he said, had not drawn the attention of politicians the way the Parkland shooting did.“It’s still rigged and they’re still going to do what they want,” Mr. Blake said of elected officials.Those competing impulses — the drive toward political confrontation, entwined with skepticism that government will accommodate them — may come to define these students as voters. As a group, they combine liberal social beliefs with an intensely wary view of the existing political and economic order, opinion polls have found. While young people are not uniformly Democratic-leaning or supportive of gun regulation, they are well to the left of the middle in their views. They have moved further toward Democrats since Mr. Trump’s election.Nearly three-fifths of millennial voters — a group slightly older than the high school-age marchers — identify as Democrats, according to a Pew Research Center study. That figure is much higher among women and minorities.Conservative supporters of gun rights have watched the teenagers’ mounting activism with concern and skepticism. They have organized competing rallies this weekend in places that include Salt Lake City and Helena, Mont., but Bryan Melchior, 45, a Utah gun-rights activist, said he sees the “gun community becoming more of a minority.”Mr. Melchior, who has been organizing a march in Salt Lake City, questioned the staying power of the Parkland movement.“It’s not going to change anything about our laws,” Mr. Melchior said of the march on Washington. “What I see is children that are just plain confused.”John Della Volpe, a pollster who studies young people’s political views for the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics, said the gun issue was part of a larger array of social views that define the next wave of voters. While young people are largely liberal, he said they were united chiefly by their dissatisfaction with the existing political system.“I think that’s what we’re seeing in this movement, in a raw form,” said Mr. Della Volpe, who met this week with some of the Stoneman Douglas activists.And at least some of the students marching this weekend have already taken steps toward becoming voters.In Colorado, Rachel Hill, 16, a junior at Columbine High School, the site of a deadly 1999 attack, said she came from a politically mixed family but when she recently signed up to vote — under a Colorado law allowing teenagers to register early — she had identified herself as a Democrat. Ms. Hill said guns were part of the reason, but so were issues like immigration, abortion and gay and transgender rights.Ms. Hill, who led a walkout at her school to protest gun violence this month, said she plans to march at a rally at the Colorado capitol this weekend. And her aspirations have swerved toward politics for the long term, too: while she once dreamed of becoming an author or an archaeologist, Ms. Hill now hopes to be a member of Congress or an ambassador.“I thought, well, Trump,” she said. “If he can get into politics and if he can get elected, why can’t I?”"
"After Stormy Daniels, Republicans Face a Referendum on Trump’s Conduct","WASHINGTON — When Representative Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania announced on Sunday that he would join more than 40 other congressional Republicans not seeking re-election in November, he left no doubt about the reason: President Trump’s conduct made it impossible to talk about anything else.Were he running, Mr. Costello said in an interview, he would be inundated with questions about Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels, who has said she had an affair with Mr. Trump and was threatened  to stay silent about it.“If I had a town hall this week, it would be question after question,” Mr. Costello said. “‘Do you believe him or do you believe her? Why don’t you believe her?’”While Republicans have been bracing for months for a punishing election in November, they are increasingly alarmed that their losses may be even worse than feared because the midterm campaign appears destined to turn more on the behavior of the man in the White House than any other in decades.As much as gun control, immigration, the sweeping tax overhaul and other issues are mobilizing voters on the left and the right, the seamy sex allegations and Mr. Trump’s erratic style could end up alienating crucial blocs of suburban voters and politically moderate women who might be drawn to some Republican policies but find the president’s purported sex antics to be reprehensible.Polls and every recent election show that Mr. Trump has galvanized liberal and moderate voters — especially women and those with college degrees — to oppose his party. Yet at the same time, personal loyalty to the president is increasingly the most crucial litmus test for Republicans.This widening chasm has created a dilemma for Republicans, especially in liberal and swing states.If they stay faithful to Mr. Trump they risk incurring the wrath of many in the political center during the general election, likely dooming their campaigns. But if they disavow the president, they risk depressing turnout from their core Republican voters and watching their pool of volunteers evaporate overnight.“It’s a political Catch-22,” J. Tucker Martin, a Virginia Republican strategist, said. “Candidates can’t win without their base. But what it takes to satisfy a pro-Trump base in 2018 will make Republican candidates in many states unacceptable to large swaths of the electorate.”And perhaps most ominous for Republicans, there does not appear to be an obvious middle ground: Mr. Martin’s candidate for governor of Virginia last November, Ed Gillespie, sought to avoid either inflaming or embracing Mr. Trump, and he was still soundly defeated.At this point, many in the party seem more consumed with their nomination contests than with steeling themselves for the general election. And they are trying to finesse awkward topics like Ms. Clifford’s claims in ways that do not turn off primary voters.In the two states where Republicans are most at risk of losing Senate seats, the party’s leading candidates have aligned themselves with Mr. Trump so far, in an attempt to pre-empt a challenge from their right in the primary. Senator Dean Heller of Nevada and Representative Martha McSally of Arizona, the establishment-preferred Senate candidate there, have praised Mr. Trump in ways that Democratic ad-makers could use against them this fall.Such short-term calculations amount to political malpractice, say Democrats.“Trump is way more than the proverbial elephant in the room — he’s the elephant in the room with political bad breath, B.O. and a foul mouth,” said Ace Smith, a veteran Democratic consultant, who argued that the last time a president’s conduct loomed so large in congressional midterms was in the post-Watergate election of 1974.And Democrats believe that Mr. Trump so overwhelms the political conversation that it makes their own liabilities pale in comparison.“I don’t see headlines with: ‘Porn star sues Nancy Pelosi,’” said Representative Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana Democrat, when asked about his party’s polarizing House leader.Just as gun control has put many Republican candidates on the defensive after Saturday’s student-led demonstrations, Mr. Trump’s behavior is increasingly backing candidates into a corner.At a debate last week, Debbie Lesko, the Republican nominee for the Arizona congressional seat vacated by Trent Franks, said that Mr. Trump “needs to address” the claims of sexual impropriety against him.“I don’t know that he can lead on that issue, but he certainly needs to deal with it and it has to be investigated,” said Ms. Lesko, a recent state senator, adding: “I don’t use his rhetoric, and I’m certainly not going to sexually harass anyone.”But in an illustration of how firm Mr. Trump’s grip is on the party base, the president’s past comments about groping women have become an issue in some races only because pro-Trump candidates are attacking Republican rivals for abandoning him over those infamous “Access Hollywood” remarks.Michigan’s attorney general, Bill Schuette, is assailing his rival for the Republican nomination for governor, Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, because Mr. Calley backed away from Mr. Trump after the “Access Hollywood” tape came out in 2016.Indeed, the party’s embrace of Mr. Trump is most striking in several Midwestern states where he triumphed in 2016, and where a large number of important Senate and governor’s races are underway.In Indiana, three candidates for Senate have each tried to position themselves as steadfast supporters of the White House, and one predicted Mr. Trump could earn a Nobel Peace Prize for his outreach to North Korea. In West Virginia and Ohio, Republican members of Congress running for Senate are boasting of having supported Mr. Trump before their states’ primaries in 2016.But even in conservative-leaning Midwestern states, there is a deepening recognition that Mr. Trump’s volatile persona is a problem. In Missouri, home to one of the nation’s most competitive Senate races, Mr. Trump swooped in this month to headline a fund-raiser for Josh Hawley, the mild-mannered state attorney general challenging Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat.Mr. Trump used the occasion to brag loudly of having bluffed his way, using made-up facts, through a phone call with Canada’s prime minister — a boast that made international news.Former Senator John C. Danforth, a senior statesman among Missouri Republicans who is a strong backer of Mr. Hawley, called the president a challenging force in the race. Voters, he said, “object to him on the basis of his style and demeanor and the way he talks and acts toward people.”Mr. Danforth said he was hopeful voters would distinguish Republicans like Mr. Hawley, a cerebral former law professor, from Mr. Trump, rather than rejecting “anybody who has the same label Trump has.”But as Mr. Costello, the representative not running for re-election in Pennsylvania, noted, Mr. Trump’s persona did not just fuel liberal activism — it also made it nearly impossible to talk about Republican policy goals.“He blocks everything out,” Mr. Costello said of the president. “What fuels the energy isn’t the issues. It’s the personality.”"
"After Gun Control Marches, ‘It’ll Go Away’ vs. ‘We Are Not Cynical Yet’","BERRYVILLE, Va. — For more than a month now, the questions have ricocheted down this Main Street culled from a Norman Rockwell dreamscape — past the dueling barbershops and the outdoor broom sale and the mural with the horse — quietly at first, when the Florida massacre was still fresh, and then not so quietly.Why would this time be different? Why should it be?“Every time something happens, everybody’s hollering,” Garland Ashby, 77, the owner of an estimated 75 guns, said of the recent protests over gun control, rubbing at his cigarette stub from a park bench in this town of 4,200. “A couple of months it’s in the news, and then it’s gone.”More than a week has passed since some 800 student-led marches pulsed through the country and abroad — more than a week for momentum to build, or stall out, or morph into something beyond anyone’s control. And in this tossup congressional district, a short drive from the demonstration’s nexus in Washington, and in other House battlegrounds nationwide, a consensus has formed on at least this much: Both sides think they are being underestimated. Both insist their adversaries will tire eventually, punching themselves out.“It’ll go away,” Mr. Ashby predicted, grinding the cigarette into the mud. “Like all the other times.”“They’re looking for us to get bored,” said Rosie Banks, 17, a high school junior about 40 miles east in Sterling, Va., whose bedroom includes the “Am I Next?” sign she hauled across the capital last month and a fish named Malcolm X. “We’re not going to get bored.”This has certainly not happened yet. Both before and after the march, high school students have shown themselves eager to hatch longer-term plans, with some plotting together last week through their spring breaks.In this stretch of Northern Virginia, students are trying to organize a town hall with Representative Barbara Comstock, one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress, recognizing that her support from the National Rifle Association could be a drag in a district that preferred Hillary Clinton in 2016.New voter registration pushes, steered by teenagers, are well underway. Students are consulting with established (and adult-run) groups like Everytown for Gun Safety, founded and financed by Michael R. Bloomberg, and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence — with plans to discuss how to host their own candidate events before November or start clubs at their schools.Even less politically active students in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District have learned Ms. Comstock’s name. “They know who she is,” said Paige Thimmesch, 16, Ms. Banks’s classmate in Sterling, Va., who is hoping to arrange the forum with the congresswoman. “They don’t know every single policy. They do know that she is pro-gun.”Looking to history, fledgling activists are researching Vietnam-era student protests for context and inspiration. They are using words like “intersectional.” They are quoting favored lyrics from “Hamilton”: “This is not a moment, it’s the movement.”That movement, though, will hinge on reversing years of below-average voter turnout among young Americans — translating sound and fury into the long, slow work of lasting change.In the 2014 midterm elections, less than 20 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 turned out to cast ballots, compared to more than 40 percent of voters between 45 and 59, according to an analysis of survey data by the United States Elections Project, which is run by Michael P. McDonald, an associate professor of political science at the University of Florida. Recent polling suggests the gap could close, at least somewhat, this fall. A Quinnipiac University survey released in late February found that 54 percent of those 18 to 34 said they were more motivated than usual to vote, outpacing every other age group.While youth-driven movements in recent years, like Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street, have installed themselves as forces in Democratic politics and the national discourse, their effects at the ballot box have been uncertain.Gun owners, mindful that flurries of mass activism have often dissipated on their own after past shootings, are still taking no chances. Some efforts have been unsavory: Survivors of the Parkland, Fla., massacre in February have been the subject of internet conspiracy theories and bizarre fictions. More civic-minded supporters of gun rights are discussing counter-rallies this month to demonstrate their collective might.“All these calls for gun control are only making gun owners snap to attention,” said Philip Van Cleave, the leader of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, a gun rights group. “This is not a one-way movement by any means.”Then there is the N.R.A., whose track record includes few political losses in recent memory — its power derived less from direct donations than a fine-tuned electioneering machine primed to mobilize voters with a letter-grade system for assessing candidates and tens of millions of dollars in campaign ads and voter-guide mailings. Shortly after the Parkland shooting, President Trump expressed support for gun restrictions opposed by the N.R.A., scolding fellow Republicans for kowtowing to the group. It did not take long, after an Oval Office meeting with N.R.A. officials, for the president to reverse himself.Yet even in corners of the country unaccustomed to dissent on gun issues, supporters of restrictions sense an opening. In Maine’s Second Congressional District, a region that includes both small cities and parcels of land so rural they are officially called “unorganized territory,” school walkouts and satellite March for Our Lives protests have specked the map, powered by students and Democratic activists.Though gun owners have betrayed little immediate concern — “If they hang around, we’ll still be here, and if they don’t, we’ll still be here,” said Todd Tolhurst, the president of Gun Owners of Maine — students seem comfortable with their odds in any war of attrition.“We’ll outlive them,” said Sean Monteith, 17, a junior at Lewiston High School, adding that he hoped his peers would be able to outvote them, too. His cellphone includes a list of action items and reminders: “connect with city council,” “draft legislation,” “do not go on assumptions.”Back in Washington, a handful of Republicans seem attuned to at least two of those directives, hedging their positions in recent weeks to accommodate the post-Parkland moment. Several vulnerable members signed on to a Democratic bill authorizing federal research into gun violence. Two of them, Brian Mast and Carlos Curbelo, both Republicans from Florida, have endorsed an assault weapons ban.Activists appear determined to make others pay a professional price for declining to engage. In Colorado’s Sixth District, where Representative Mike Coffman is widely considered one of the most endangered Republican incumbents, organizers with Never Again Colorado, a new group advocating gun control, are planning a forum to discuss guns “with or without” Mr. Coffman. The district includes Aurora, where a gunman killed 12 people in a movie theater in 2012.“We have a lot of momentum right now,” said Ian Gaskins, 17, a high school junior who is helping to plan the event. “I don’t want people to stop caring about this until the next mass shooting.”For Democrats, the zeal for gun control has at once presented an uncommon opportunity and an occasion to revisit plans for midterm messaging. After Mr. Trump’s election, his opponents did not necessarily expect a gun reckoning to be central to their 2018 strategy.Last summer, as the party strained to communicate its own agenda in the Trumpian haze, Democrats chose Berryville as the backdrop to introduce a broad-strokes platform of economic populism. Their top leaders in Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, and progressive stars like Senator Elizabeth Warren schlepped 65 miles outside Washington to deliver their message in the same park where Mr. Ashby, the gun owner, flicked away his cigarette on a recent afternoon.Eight months later, it is gun violence, more than any fiscal issue, that has galvanized a new generation of prospective Democrats, some not yet old enough to vote.In Virginia, the party had already long targeted Ms. Comstock, casting her as a poor fit for a district that includes some rural pockets, like Berryville, but also left-leaning Washington suburbs and vast reserves of more moderate voters repelled by Mr. Trump. “Barbara Bump-Stock,” said Candy Baracat-Donovan, 34, from Leesburg, Va., whose morning routine now includes a round of phone calls to the offices of representatives like Ms. Comstock.A spokesman for Ms. Comstock, Jeff Marschner, said the congresswoman was “committed to a multipronged effort to prevent gun violence,” citing her support for additional mental health funding and narrow, N.R.A.-backed legislation improving reporting to the national background check database, among other measures.It is not clear if she will agree to a town hall with students. They seem to understand the calculation.“High school students are scary,” said Jay Falk, 18, a senior in Virginia who co-founded Students Demand Action DMV, a gun control group with over 100 members. “We are not cynical yet.”"
"Year of the Woman? In Arizona, It’s Women, Plural, and It’s Both Parties","PHOENIX — Melinda Merkel Iyer was a stay-at-home mother and political novice when Donald J. Trump was elected president. She didn’t sleep that night. The next day, Ms. Iyer pored over the state legislature’s website, discovered how to track bills, and soon turned her notes on thwarting conservative proposals into a do-it-yourself newsletter.Five months later, Ms. Iyer was live-tweeting from the statehouse to rouse alarm over a school voucher bill that looked likely to pass. Together with Save Our Schools, an alliance of educators and parents that sprang from a postelection Facebook group, she helped collect more than 100,000 signatures against the bill — forcing the issue to a referendum on the ballot this fall.“We’re not going to sit back anymore and let policies go through in the middle of the night,” Ms. Iyer said recently at the Arizona Capitol Museum coffee shop. “I never thought I’d be in a place where I’d know the Koch brothers lobbyists by sight — and they’d know me.”If this is the Year of the Woman in politics, few places are a better showcase than Arizona, where a surge of female activists and candidates is reshaping policy debates and campaign conversations up and down the ballot. In a way, it’s only fitting: Arizona, long an emblem of conservatism, also has a history of shattering stereotypes about women in power. The state leads the nation in electing women as governor — two Democrats and two Republicans — and ties with Vermont for the highest proportion of women in legislatures at 40 percent.Arizona is a coveted target for Democrats, who hope to flip House seats and the state legislature. Yet party leaders have repeatedly tried and failed to win big here. Hillary Clinton held out hope of carrying Arizona in 2016, but Donald Trump won by more than three percentage points. The state has elected deeply conservative leaders like former Gov. Jan Brewer, and it has been a testing ground for harsh immigration policies later embraced by Mr. Trump. Women are playing leading roles in both parties, with Republicans fielding strong female candidates at all levels — a reminder after Mrs. Clinton’s loss that women do not vote in a bloc.The state embodies dynamics seen across the country. Shocked and despairing at Mr. Trump’s election, women on the left concluded they had been complacent and are now diving into politics, many for the first time. Democrats are hoping to capitalize on a growing Hispanic electorate; Republicans are testing whether their close embrace of the president helps or hurts.Among the state’s marquee races is an all-out fight for the Senate seat being vacated by Jeff Flake, with candidates including Representative Martha McSally, the Air Force’s first female fighter pilot; Kelli Ward, a former state senator and hard-right politician known for her conspiracy theories; and Joe Arpaio, the sheriff whose anti-immigrant stances cost him his job in 2016 on the Republican side. Representative Kyrsten Sinema is running against another woman and several men on the Democratic side. On the state level, January Contreras, a Democrat, is the first Latina to run for state attorney general.There’s also a #MeToo-inflected special election to replace Representative Trent Franks, who resigned under pressure in a sexual harassment scandal. On April 24, Debbie Lesko, a former state senator who beat 11 Republican male primary challengers as a full-throated Trump supporter, will face off against Hiral Tipirneni, a doctor and political newcomer who trained with Emerge America, one of several groups that recruit Democratic women to run for office.Still, Arizona remains a state that has not had a Democratic senator since 1995 and where Republicans have the trifecta of governor and both houses of the legislature. Entrenched conservative values will clash this year with a liberal fervor that often plays out at the local level, in grinding, unglamorous work.This surge of activism is engaging women of all ages and backgrounds, but tensions are already flaring between women on the left and the center about whom to endorse. Advice and training are pouring in from a bevy of national organizations, including Planned Parenthood and Indivisible, another of the “resistance” groups that published a widely downloaded organizing guide.Women make up a majority of Indivisible’s ranks in Phoenix; they hold weekly protests, canvass for candidates and convene summit meetings, including a visit from the strategists who ran the ground game for the recent Democratic gains in the Virginia state legislature. Julie Golding, a financial analyst, maintains an “AZ Resist” calendar of activities across the state that logs between 30 and 60 events a day.Democrats continue to hope that they can win votes by increasing turnout among Arizona’s large and growing Hispanic population. Ana Maria Escobedo, an entrepreneur, joined Indivisible determined to rally more Hispanics to register; she is knocking on doors to enlist new voters, and proudly recounted how she and an avid Trump supporter spent all night talking at a wedding so she could rebut him point by point.Sustaining this momentum is far from assured. “People are angry,” said Kate Fisher, who corrals volunteers for Planned Parenthood. “But to translate that into activists who will be here in November — that’s the challenge.” On top of her day job as an engineer at Arizona State University, Ms. Fisher devotes nights and weekends to juggling schedules for voter registration, inviting volunteers to dinner and guiding them to political organizing tools like the Voter Action Network, a database that tracks voter records and assesses who’s persuadable.Other women have geared up to run for local offices where Republicans have enjoyed considerable success, with the party controlling 32 state legislatures to Democrats’ 13. Jennifer Jermaine interrupted her maternity leave after the election to post a call on Facebook for a new group she christened Stronger Together Arizona to mobilize community action including voter registration. Within 10 days, she said she had 10,000 members and 1,000 women attended the first meeting on Nov. 20; they in turn spun off Save Our Schools Arizona, which capitalizes on growing anger about education cuts.“The moms of Arizona got pissed off and decided to do something,” she said. Now she is collecting signatures to appear on the ballot to challenge a Republican state representative.This influx of newly involved women meshes and sometimes clashes with years of political action by a growing cadre of Hispanics enraged by anti-immigrant policies. Carmen Cornejo, chairwoman of Chicanos Por La Causa and a longtime advocate for the Dreamers, said an early example and playbook for many of today’s mobilization efforts in the Latino community was the recall of the State Senate president, Russell Pearce, in 2011 and the defeat of Mr. Arpaio in 2016.Several longtime Hispanic advocates welcome the swell of activism, but say that some of the newcomers failed to defer to their experience, heed their strategic advice, or embrace their political priorities.“They need to trust that women of color can be strategists,” said Alejandra Gomez, co-executive director of Lucha, a local advocacy group. “We know we’re in it for the long haul. We want these women to also be in it for the long haul, not just this fired-up moment.”Ms. Gomez’s commitment was forged by personal experience. She is a citizen, but her father was not until recently, and the family left California in 1999 as anti-immigrant sentiment swelled, only to encounter it again in Arizona. She, like some other Hispanic activists and progressive groups, has balked at what she sees as a lessening of commitment on immigration issues by Democrats like Ms. Sinema who are trying to woo independents and moderate Republicans. Ms. Cornejo says she hopes young activists will eventually accept a candidate like Ms. Sinema to stave off harsher measures that Republicans endorse; Ms. Gomez once admired her but now says she would not back her. Ms. Sinema’s office declined to comment.As these tensions play out among Democrats, Republican women are also vying to claim an Arizona heritage that has embraced feisty women stretching back to the state’s frontier and rancher roots.As a former fighter pilot given to blunt pronouncements, Ms. McSally fits this mold and is most pundits’ bet to oppose Ms. Sinema for Senate. According to a tally of statewide and congressional races kept by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers, so far more Democratic women than Republican ones are running for state and congressional seats in Arizona, but Republican women remain formidable in the state.One early test of Republican strength may be the special election.Ms. Tipirneni, in an echo of Democratic national strategy, is hoping to carve out support from independents and moderate Republicans through her embrace of health care and opposition to a school voucher plan Ms. Lesko backed.But Ms. Lesko has several advantages: years in the state legislature; a district where far more Republicans voted in the primary than Democrats; and an electorate she says is majority pro-Trump, even as she has called on the president to address accusations of sexual improprieties. She also says her own history as an abused wife who mustered the courage to leave her first husband more than 25 years ago has resonated with other women.For her part, Ms. Iyer is relishing her transition from suburban mother to legislative scourge. She posted her first newsletter on Facebook, reaching about 350 friends; now she posts it on a civic engagement site and estimates it reaches about 35,000 people. In the days after the presidential election, she discovered Arizona’s Request to Speak program, which allows a verified voter to register an opinion on a bill and ask to appear before the legislature. At first, she said, she noticed a lawmaker rolling his eyes and others texting under the table as she spoke.But after the successful Save Our Schools petition drive and her attendance at statewide protests calling for teachers’ raises, she recounted a different attitude: “They know when we sit in their office that there are thousands more like us.”"
"Trump Blasts Comey in Barrage of Tweets, Calling Him ‘Slippery’","For the second time in a week, President Trump on Sunday excoriated the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey in a series of tweets after details from Mr. Comey’s tell-all book were leaked before its official release.In the latest tirade, which unfolded over an hour, the president declared that Mr. Comey “will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!” He mentioned Mr. Comey’s contemporaneous notes of their meetings, calling those memos self-serving and “fake.”He again called Mr. Comey a “slimeball,” an insult he lobbed on Friday. He also questioned Mr. Comey’s intelligence twice — first by saying the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails had been handled “stupidly” and then, about 30 minutes later, that Mr. Comey “is not smart!”Hours later, Mr. Comey appeared to make an indirect response to the jabs. In a post on Twitter, he said his book, “A Higher Loyalty,” was about “ethical leadership” and drew not only from his own life but also from “lessons I learned from others.”Of the three presidents mentioned in the book, two help illustrate “the values at the heart of ethical leadership,” Mr. Comey said, and one “serves as a counterpoint.”In his tirade, Mr. Trump questioned the integrity of former United States Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who said in a recent interview with NBC News that she did not discuss Mrs. Clinton during her meeting with President Bill Clinton in June 2016 on a plane on an airport tarmac. Mrs. Clinton’s exclusive use of a private email server has long been the subject of controversy, and that meeting with Mr. Clinton cast a shadow over the federal investigation.Ms. Lynch told NBC that Mr. Clinton told a “charming story” about grandchildren and discussed issues of the day, such as Brexit.Mr. Trump balked at that description, writing on Twitter, “Was she promised a Supreme Court seat, or AG, in order to lay off Hillary. No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!”The president’s sharp remarks came hours ahead of Mr. Comey’s first major news media appearance since being fired by President Trump last year. Excerpts from the interview, which is set to air on ABC News on Sunday night, have been shared by the network after details from Mr. Comey’s book leaked on Thursday.Mr. Comey’s book describes Mr. Trump as “unethical, and untethered to truth” and compared Mr. Trump to a Mafia boss.[Read our review of Mr. Comey’s memoir.]The book also speculates about Mr. Trump’s refusal to acknowledge Russia’s attempt to influence the election.“Maybe it was a contrarian streak,” Mr. Comey wrote, “or maybe it was something more complicated that explained his constant equivocation and apologies for Vladimir Putin.”On Friday, Mr. Trump and his allies counterattacked after the book excerpts leaked, and Democrats, many of whom blame Mr. Comey for Mrs. Clinton’s loss in the 2016 election,  issued a muted defense.Mr. Trump continued his criticism of Mr. Comey’s book on Sunday, questioning why Mr. Comey had not used the book to address questions such as why “he gave up Classified Information.”Amid his tweets about Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump also addressed the latest military strike in Syria, defending his use of the phrase “mission accomplished” and saying the raid was “perfectly carried out.”"
Bernie Sanders Says ‘Trump’s Agenda Is Dead’ if Democrats Win Midterms,"Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, vowing to play an influential role in the 2018 midterm elections, was blunt on Friday about the stakes for the Democratic Party.“If Democrats control either the House or the Senate, Trump’s agenda is dead,” Mr. Sanders said during a conversation with New York Times reporters and editors.At this critical moment ahead of hundreds of House and Senate primaries, Mr. Sanders also argued that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and other national party organizations are not doing enough to support liberal grass-roots candidates who are running against Mr. Trump and backing a progressive agenda.“The establishment Democrats are still, I think, looking toward candidates who can self-fund,” said Mr. Sanders, a progressive independent who had enormous success raising about $230 million in mostly small-dollar and online donations during his 2016 presidential bid.National Democrats “still have a tendency to believe that more conservative candidates are better positioned to win,” he added. Mr. Sanders argued that ideas like “Medicare for All” and a higher minimum wage, which he championed in 2016, are increasingly popular and helpful to Democratic candidates.Mr. Sanders said he plans to make endorsements in the midterms, but that he is still deciding where he can be most effective.In the New York governor’s race, in which Cynthia Nixon, the progressive activist and former “Sex and the City” star, is challenging Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in the Democratic primary, Mr. Sanders declined to make an endorsement when asked. Ms. Nixon has positioned herself as more of a populist, criticizing Mr. Cuomo for his reliance on large donors.“Governor Cuomo has a strong record, he has done some very good things, obviously there are areas where I disagree with him,” Mr. Sanders said. “Cynthia seems to be generating a lot of grass-roots enthusiasm running on a progressive platform.”Asked if he could envision endorsing Mr. Cuomo over Ms. Nixon, Mr. Sanders reiterated that he was not making any endorsements on Friday.The political stances of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Cuomo became a point of debate this past week when a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo said the two politicians were “in lockstep.”Asked about that comment, Mr. Sanders replied, “My staff said something differently,” referring to a vulgarity posted on Twitter by one of his advisers about the topic."
The Fight for Wisconsin Is On as Outside Money Pours Into Senate Race,"PORTAGE, Wis. — The attack ads began in early 2017, planting doubts well ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Against ominous background music and storm clouds, the Republican-financed spots hit Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin’s Democratic senator, over the Affordable Care Act, Iran and veterans’ health care.By July, a Milwaukee radio station was carrying audacious ads about Ms. Baldwin’s support for abortion rights.“Did you know one out of three babies aborted in America are black? One out of three. And Tammy Baldwin is a big reason why,” the ad said. “That could be the next Frederick Douglass or Rosa Parks or Martin Luther King they’re aborting.”Then came the positive ads describing one of her opponents, Kevin Nicholson, as a former Marine; an “outsider”; a businessman; and, like Ronald Reagan, a convert to conservatism.For many national Republicans, Ms. Baldwin has emerged as the top target in the 2018 midterms: Donors from outside the state are spending twice as much money on the race so far as on any other Senate contest this year, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics. Much of the money has gone toward television and radio ads.The big spending doesn’t just signal that each party sees the Senate seat as winnable. It’s also a measure of intensity on both sides to prevail in Wisconsin after Donald J. Trump shocked Democrats in 2016 by being the first Republican presidential nominee to carry the state since 1984. National Democrats are bent on winning it back in 2020 — and getting Ms. Baldwin re-elected is a crucial step toward that goal.The fight may become the most expensive Wisconsin Senate race ever: An analysis by the state Democratic Party found that nearly $10 million in advertising had already aired or been purchased by outside groups against Ms. Baldwin or in favor of Mr. Nicholson. (Mr. Nicholson’s camp put the number at nearly $9 million.) At least another $3.7 million in advertising is underway sponsored by outside groups in favor of Ms. Baldwin.The advertising by political action committees like Restoration PAC and Americas PAC — both heavily financed by the hard-right industrialist Richard Uihlein — has propelled the first-time candidacy of Mr. Nicholson, and underscores the influential role that outside conservative PACs play in this politically polarized state. Organizations funded by Mr. Uihlein and the billionaire Koch brothers have devoted millions to assuring continued Republican control of the Senate, and many conservatives view Ms. Baldwin, 56, as a beatable first-term senator who symbolizes the extreme left wing of the Democratic Party.“Tammy Baldwin is very vulnerable,” said Brad Courtney, the state’s Republican chairman, calling her one of the Senate’s most liberal members. “There’s going to be lots of money coming into Wisconsin.”Even in this rural area of small farms, nearly two hours from Milwaukee, it’s hard to avoid the drumbeat of ads, which began well before the traditional start of campaign season.“I hear a lot of stuff on the radio,” said Gary Buchholz, a soil technician who was part of the crowd at J & J Fireball Lanes, a local bowling alley, and plans to vote for Ms. Baldwin. “I don’t like the money that comes in from out of state, huge amounts of money trying to influence Wisconsin elections.”Partly to counter the advertising, an energized Democratic base is organizing early, determined to retain the Senate seat held by their party since 1957, when William Proxmire was elected to the unexpired term of Joseph McCarthy, who had died in office. Yet Wisconsin has become a Republican stronghold: The state not only voted for Mr. Trump, but has also become a laboratory for conservative policy ideas under its two-term governor, Scott Walker, and the Republican-controlled legislature.In November, Ms. Baldwin is expected to face either Mr. Nicholson or Leah Vukmir, a conservative state senator favored by the state’s Republican establishment. Ms. Vukmir, 59, has also benefited from political action committee spending, with a $935,000 ad buy by a group called Wisconsin Next PAC, funded partly by the Beloit businesswoman Diane Hendricks. Ms. Vukmir has also received scores of endorsements from state Republicans, including the support of Reince Priebus, a Wisconsinite who served as White House chief of staff.Democrats privately expressed concern that the negative advertising has whittled away at Ms. Baldwin’s support. A March poll by Marquette Law School revealed that her approval rating was a mere 37 percent.Fearing a reprise of the 2016 Wisconsin Senate race — when outside groups targeted the Democratic candidate, Russ Feingold, who lost even though he had held a lead two months before the election in a Marquette poll over the incumbent Republican, Senator Ron Johnson — Ms. Baldwin’s campaign has already dug into her formidable campaign chest. Her campaign said it planned to have 60 field organizers in place statewide by the end of next month.Ms. Baldwin’s campaign also said it had released television advertising earlier than any incumbent Senate Democrat nationally, including one last week emphasizing her support for Wisconsin’s cheese industry. Dairy farms have been a staple of rural areas of Wisconsin like Portage, the county seat of Columbia County, one of 23 Wisconsin counties carried by Mr. Trump that President Barack Obama had won in 2012. The industry has been hard-hit statewide, particularly in Columbia County.“We’re in a crisis situation, losing a farm a day,” said Sarah Lloyd, whose family milks 350 cows and who supports Ms. Baldwin, partly because of her efforts to bolster a milk price federal insurance program.Ms. Lloyd, who previously ran for Congress, was among about 100 Democrats who braved a harsh April snowstorm to attend the party’s annual county dinner at a motel in this town of about 11,000 residents. Despite the weather, organizers said the meeting was the second-biggest turnout of Democrats ever in Columbia County.“Hillary took Wisconsin for granted,” said Ms. Lloyd, referring to the 2016 Democratic nominee. “We’re not going to let that happen again.”The next day, with snow still falling, a hardy group of about 150 Republicans turned out for a Lincoln-Reagan Day luncheon in Mequon, an affluent and reliably Republican suburb of Milwaukee.Addressing the crowd at the River Club of Mequon, in a ballroom with a panoramic golf course view, State Representative Jim Ott shared his concerns about a “blue wave” in November, describing how “40 angry Democrats” had taken over his normally staid town hall meeting.The results of two recent Wisconsin elections in which outside spending was a factor have added to Republican worries.In a January special election upset, a local medical examiner, a Democrat, easily defeated a Republican state legislator for a State Senate seat held by Republicans for 17 years. In that race, the Republican got help from radio and digital advertising by Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-funded group. Then, in April, in a statewide Supreme Court election, a liberal judge from Milwaukee County defeated a county circuit judge backed by conservatives. The winner in that race received a boost from digital ads paid for by the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, an organization headed by former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.In many ways, the dynamics in Wisconsin mirror what’s happening nationally within the Republican Party, with deeply conservative newcomers allying with outside donors to challenge more traditional Republicans.The insurgent candidacy of Mr. Nicholson — a Wisconsin native and Bronze Star recipient who has earned more than $1 million in the past two years as a consultant — appears to have been shaped in large part by the money of Mr. Uihlein, the founder of a shipping and industrial supply company.Long a power broker in Illinois and Wisconsin political circles, Mr. Uihlein has taken a more aggressive national approach this year, spending $20 million to back conservatives in races across the country. In March of last year, a new Uihlein-backed PAC, Solutions for Wisconsin, announced that Mr. Uihlein had contributed $2 million to support a Senate run by Mr. Nicholson. In all, according to a recent Democratic Party analysis, spending by Uihlein-funded groups in favor of Mr. Nicholson and against Ms. Baldwin exceeds $5.4 million. Mr. Uihlein did not respond to a request for an interview regarding the Wisconsin Senate race.Mr. Nicholson, a telegenic 40-year-old who always seems to have a fresh haircut, said he had begun exploring the idea of a Senate run well before Mr. Trump’s election, seeking support both inside the state and from national donors.“The coalition is very impressive,” Mr. Nicholson said, reeling off a list of six groups supporting him, including four groups that have received large donations from Mr. Uihlein. “We have a lot of groups stepping in to say, ‘We’re going to help you take back that seat.’”Mr. Nicholson’s political metamorphosis from Democrat to Republican has attracted thinly veiled criticism from some within the party who question his sincerity. Ms. Vukmir, who worked as a registered nurse for many years, told the crowd in Mequon, “I’m 100 percent pro-life and I have always been 100 percent pro-life.”It was an apparent reference to Mr. Nicholson’s evolved position on abortion. In 2000, while president of the national College Democrats, Mr. Nicholson spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, emphasizing his support for a woman’s right to choose, among other liberal causes.Mr. Nicholson has given various interviews about his transformation from Democrat to Republican, saying that he departed the 2000 convention disillusioned with the party.Perhaps illustrating the political polarization of this state, Mr. Nicholson says he hasn’t spoken with his Democratic parents in more than a year, blaming their estrangement on his political choices. “No doubt, obviously for them, it created a lot of frustration and disagreement that I feel the way I do and they made a decision that I think is unfortunate,” Mr. Nicholson said.His parents are donors to Ms. Baldwin’s campaign."
"Romney Failed to Win at Utah Convention, but Few Believe He’s Doomed","LEHI, Utah — Mitt Romney wound his way through this city’s tulip festival on Monday, shaking hands, hugging toddlers and shrugging off his failure to sew up the nomination for an open Senate seat at this state’s Republican Party convention last weekend.“I don’t think it was any particular surprise for us,” he said. “We’re going to have a primary, and we’re ready for it.”On Saturday, after a raucous day of voting at the Utah Republican convention, delegates delivered 49 percent of their votes to Mr. Romney, and 51 percent to a little-known state legislator named Mike Kennedy, who likened himself to the stone of the shepherd boy David, “ready to be flung at the foes of liberty.”The vote pushed the two into a June 26 primary. And it led to speculation that Mr. Romney’s bid for the seat of Orrin G. Hatch, who is retiring, would not be as easy as expected — and that perhaps his once biting criticism of Donald J. Trump had become a political liability.But longtime observers of Utah politics say that Mr. Romney’s failure to secure the nomination happened not because he has rebuffed the president, but because the convention’s hard-right delegates were angry that Mr. Romney had tried to circumvent them with a second route to the nomination: signature gathering.“It would be a mistake to say that what happened in the convention was about Donald Trump,” said Jason Perry, director of the Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah. “This was about other factors,” he went on. “Delegates do not like power being taken away from them.”Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, who moved to Utah after serving as governor of Massachusetts, remains popular among this state’s heavily Mormon Republican electorate, and he is expected to cruise to victory in the primary and general elections. (Mr. Romney is also Mormon.)But he encountered two daunting hurdles on Saturday: the deeply conservative nature of delegates who attend Utah Republican conventions and, because of a change in the rules governing the nominating process, a fear among these activists that they are losing their grip on the state party.There is a long history of the G.O.P. conventions favoring more hard-line candidates, but their preference has of late mattered less to primary voters. In 2016, Gov. Gary Herbert failed to win a majority of convention delegates but went on to win renomination in the primary by a 44-point margin. And in a special House race last year, Representative John R. Curtis finished fourth at the convention and still won the primary and general elections.These Republicans were not stymied by the conventions because of a controversial 2014 state law allowing candidates to earn a position on the primary ballot by gathering signatures from voters. Party activists resent this change, seeing it as an attempt to dilute their influence, and it has emerged as a litmus test question in their universe for Republican candidates, even as much as any policy issue.Some of Mr. Romney’s advisers knew that his well-documented history of ideological swerving and recently declared residency in the state would not be received well in a room of 3,627 delegates who are more conservative than their would-be standard-bearer and are now on edge about their relevance.But much like in the lead-up to Mr. Romney’s presidential bid in 2012, when some of his associates urged him to stay away from the hard-right Iowa caucuses, he had little interest in circumventing the party process. Not wanting to be seen as bigfooting the state party, he gathered signatures to appear on the primary ballot but also submitted to Utah’s caucus-convention system, which includes a series of local delegate-selection meetings leading up to the state convention.Mr. Kennedy is a three-time state legislator and family doctor whose convention speech focused on slashing the national debt, supporting Mr. Trump’s immigration policies and repealing Obamacare. In an email, he pledged support for the president and vowed to continue campaigning, despite Mr. Romney’s significant financial advantage.But few in the state expect Mr. Kennedy to pose much of a threat. On Monday, as Mr. Romney toured the tulip festival, parents laden with strollers and toddlers gave him the celebrity treatment.None had known that Mr. Romney would be stopping by.“Oh my god,” said one woman, whipping out her cellphone, “it’s Mitt Romney.”Daniel Roberts, 65, a retired schoolteacher, tapped the candidate on the shoulder and asked to shake the hand of the “next president.”“Mitt Romney has a huge reputation that follows him,” Mr. Roberts said. “I really have no idea what the other guy’s stances are — and I’m not really interested.”Still, the convention rejection of Mr. Romney was embarrassing given his stature in the state.The man who just a few years ago was debating President Barack Obama before millions of viewers took the stage on Saturday with 11 other candidates — including an Abraham Lincoln impersonator who had legally changed his name to that of the former president but, reading from parchment-type paper, still referred to Mr. Lincoln in the third person.And after putting 9,250 miles on his pickup truck driving to caucus gatherings in living rooms and school cafeterias around the state, Mr. Romney still lost.But Utah Republican leaders said Mr. Romney was wise to risk the momentary failure of losing the convention so as not to be seen as too good for the sort of activists who typically do the unglamorous work of volunteering each campaign.“If there was going to be a backfire for Mitt, that would have happened if he had taken the 30,000-foot approach and skipped the convention,” said Gregory Hughes, Utah’s state house Speaker. “But by working to earn the support of the delegates he made it closer than I thought it would be.”Mr. Hughes said Mr. Romney’s two most glaring weaknesses were fused in the minds of many delegates.“This is a guy from Massachusetts, where he had very different political leanings,” he said.Convention delegates who backed Mr. Kennedy echoed that assessment.“He’s not been in the state forever and he’s been wishy-washy, flip-flopped on issues over the years,” said Eugene Christensen, a 55-year-old delegate from Bear River City.But in a demonstration of why Mr. Romney faces little threat in the primary, Mr. Christensen quickly added that while he is disposed toward Mr. Kennedy, he is still in “wait-and-see mode” and believes that the former Massachusetts governor would do “a good job” as the state’s newest senator."
"Debbie Lesko Wins Arizona Special Election for Congress, Rallying G.O.P.","WASHINGTON — The former Arizona state senator Debbie Lesko fended off an unusually strong Democratic challenge to win a special congressional election on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press, demonstrating the resilience of the Republican base but also the eagerness of liberals to compete in even the most heavily conservative districts.Lifted by more than $1 million in outside spending from Republican groups determined to avoid another electoral embarrassment, Ms. Lesko defeated Hiral Tipirneni, a physician and first-time candidate, in a district President Trump carried by over 20 points.But in a sign of Democratic enthusiasm in this midterm election year, Ms. Lesko won by only about five points.Ms. Lesko was helped by an aggressive intervention from Republican leaders that included a wave of robocalls from Mr. Trump and fund-raisers hosted by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader.Republican officials described their efforts as precautionary, a nod toward the party’s humiliating special election losses in Alabama and Pennsylvania and an acknowledgment that they must fortify their defenses in even the reddest of districts.The Phoenix-area seat for the Eighth Congressional District, a haven for sunshine-seeking retirees from the Midwest, is so reliably Republican that Democrats did not even field a candidate in the last two elections.But after the previous representative, Trent Franks, resigned following revelations he had offered $5 million to an aide in exchange for carrying his child, Arizona Democrats rallied to Ms. Tipirneni. She outraised Ms. Lesko in what was the first high-profile congressional election since 2016 between two women.National Democrats, however, stayed away from the race, deducing that a district that has sent only Republicans to Congress for four decades was out of reach. And any hopes Ms. Tipirneni had to win outside support may have faded this month when a local TV station reported that she had not practiced medicine since 2007 and had settled a malpractice lawsuit with a woman who blamed her for contracting tetanus.In contrast, the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund, the primary House Republican super PAC, each poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into the race. The investment proved critical in what became an unexpectedly close race.“It’s a warning shot,” Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said of the results. “Anything below a 10-point margin is not good news.”Mr. Trump sought to put a better face on the results Wednesday morning, writing on Twitter that it was a “big win” and asserting that the “press is so silent.”Ms. Lesko, 59, ran as a dependable supporter of Mr. Trump and assailed Ms. Tipirneni for not backing White House priorities like the construction of a wall on the Mexican border. With help from the battery of outside Republican organizations, Ms. Lesko sought to polarize the district along traditional partisan lines, branding Ms. Tipirneni as a liberal and a puppet of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader.Rather than wait for the contest to tighten, the groups helped Ms. Lesko build an early advantage in a race in which the vast majority of voters cast their ballots early. Registered Republicans far outnumbered Democrats in the early voting period, and the median age was 67 among those voting before Election Day, an indication of a heavily conservative electorate.Ms. Tipirneni, 50, found energetic support among some women in the district who were uneasy about Mr. Trump and had been roused to get active in politics. As Representative Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania did in a special election last month, she offered herself as a moderate who would not support Ms. Pelosi for House speaker.But unlike Mr. Lamb’s Pittsburgh-area seat — which includes an array of vote-rich, upscale suburbs — the Arizona district is full of AARP-eligible snowbirds, reliably Republican Mormons and military families who work at nearby Luke Air Force Base. And this race was a head-to-head contest — there was no Libertarian on the ballot, as in Pennsylvania, who could have allowed Ms. Tipirneni to eke out a win had it proved closer.This was not a district that was on either party’s list of seats that will determine control of the House. But the steps conservatives took to secure victory for a former officeholder illustrate just how much the anti-Trump energy on the left is putting Republicans on the defensive across the country."
"Don Blankenship, West Virginia Candidate, Lives Near Las Vegas and Mulled Chinese Citizenship","KEYSER, W.Va. — Don Blankenship is running for the United States Senate as a proud West Virginian with Appalachian roots, but his primary residence is a $2.4 million villa with palm trees and an infinity pool near Las Vegas.Mr. Blankenship, a Republican loyalist of President Trump, is running an America First-style campaign and calls himself an “American competitionist,” but he admires China’s state-controlled economy and has expressed interest in gaining Chinese citizenship.The former coal mining executive is widely known for spending a year in prison for his role in a mining explosion that claimed 29 lives. Yet ahead of the May 8 primary election, he is running as a champion of miners and has bought TV ads that challenge settled facts about his role in the disaster.And even as Mr. Blankenship seeks to join the Republican majority in Washington, a “super PAC” linked to the party establishment is attacking him as a “convicted criminal” and a hypocrite.No Republican candidate in the 2018 midterms embodies so many contradictions as pointedly as Mr. Blankenship, who was found guilty of conspiracy to violate mine safety standards in federal court and yet has plenty of supporters in coal country.He is one of three leading Republican contenders heading into the primary, even though he is lugging around enough political baggage to disqualify a candidate most anywhere else.That Mr. Blankenship retains a political hope is a consequence of West Virginia’s sharp shift to the right, driven by seething hostility to the Obama presidency, both its social changes and its perceived “war” on coal. The emergence of a former coal boss with a criminal record as a potential Senate nominee seems partly an expression of many West Virginia voters’ desire to poke a thumb in the eye of the Washington establishment, Republicans very much included.Mr. Blankenship offers no apology for his many contradictions and personal and business decisions, some of them previously undisclosed. Though he lives a baronial lifestyle thanks to a fortune built on coal scratched from West Virginia’s mountains, he says the size and origins of his wealth are no one’s business. He is the only candidate in either party in the Senate race who has not disclosed his personal finances as required by law to the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. There isn’t “much of a penalty” for flouting the law, he explained in an interview, justifying his refusal.“I don’t personally think anybody should have to disclose private information,” he said while awaiting the start of a “meet the candidates” event last week in Cabin Creek, W.Va.National Republican leaders are alarmed that Mr. Blankenship could emerge as the winner of the primary, which they fear would cost them a winnable seat in November against Senator Joe Manchin, a vulnerable Democrat.In a highly unusual move, a super PAC linked to Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky senator and Republican leader, began saturating the West Virginia airwaves last week with an ad attacking Mr. Blankenship for poisoning local drinking water from his former coal mines. The nearly $745,000 campaign of TV and digital ads is meant to boost the chances of two conventional Republicans in the race, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Representative Evan Jenkins. A Fox News poll conducted last week found a fluid race, with Mr. Blankenship trailing his rivals but about one in four voters undecided.On Monday, responding to the attack ads, Mr. Blankenship brought up Mr. McConnell’s marriage to Elaine Chao, the secretary of transportation, and questioned whether the majority leader faced a conflict of interest in foreign relations. Ms. Chao’s father is “a wealthy Chinaperson,” Mr. Blankenship said, speaking on a West Virginia radio show, adding, “And there’s a lot of connections to some of the brass, if you will, in China.”“I read in books that people think he’s soft on China,” he said of Mr. McConnell.China, as it happens, is a topic of personal interest to Mr. Blankenship. His fiancée, Farrah Meiling Hobbs, was born there. The two met on a flight from Atlanta to Las Vegas about eight years ago, Mr. Blankenship said. According to the website of an international trading company Ms. Hobbs founded, she is “a former Chinese professional basketball player and part-time model” who moved to the United States in 1996.In 2016 Ms. Hobbs and Mr. Blankenship paid $2.4 million in cash to buy the palatial home near Las Vegas that Mr. Blankenship claims in court papers is his principal residence. It is a six-bedroom, eight-bath Spanish-style mansion with marble floors and a dolphin sculpture beside the pool, according to an online real estate site. (He also owns a residence in West Virginia.)It was purchased just before Mr. Blankenship began a one-year prison sentence following his conviction on a misdemeanor count related to the 2010 explosion at Upper Big Branch mine, the deadliest mine accident in the United States in 40 years.Though Mr. Blankenship stepped down that year as chief executive of the Massey Energy Company, he exited with his sumptuous earnings intact. Massey paid him $17.8 million in his last year. He gained an additional $86.2 million when the company was later sold, by one estimate.Part of Mr. Blankenship’s assets are now paying for some $2 million of TV and digital ads — far more than his rivals — that seek to muddy the picture of his 2015 conviction by painting him as a victim of a politically driven “Obama judge” and “Obama prosecutors.”Family members of the 29 Upper Big Branch victims said it was crushing to watch those ads, in which Mr. Blankenship portrays himself as a champion of safety and refuses responsibility for the loss of life.“I want Mr. Blankenship to say he’s sorry, I want him to feel contrition, I want him to feel compassion,” said Dr. Judy Jones Petersen, whose brother Dean Jones died in the explosion. “People have to understand that Mr. Blankenship is a bad man. Your character doesn’t change.”In his campaign, Mr. Blankenship positions himself as a West Virginia populist, an “American competitionist” who stands for unfettered capitalism. The heart of the government’s case against him at trial was that he rapaciously sought profit while ignoring mine safety.Yet he identifies the new frontier of uninhibited capitalism as China. In a telephone conversation he recorded in 2009, introduced at his trial, Mr. Blankenship said he might move to Asia where governments enforce fewer regulations.“I’m actually considering moving to China or somewhere and being more like George Washington if I can get citizenship,” he said. “I can probably get citizenship in India. I’d rather be in China.”In the interview, he repeated this sentiment and freely discussed his financial history in China, though he said foreign citizenship was no longer a priority for him — perhaps dual citizenship would be useful, he mused.He expressed admiration for how Beijing exercises central control over its economy.“Americans confuse the words communism and dictatorship,” he said. “The Chinese are running a dictatorial capitalism and it’s very effective. That’s the way corporations are run. Corporations are not a democracy.”Before his foreign travel was restricted after his arrest in 2014, Mr. Blankenship was a frequent enough visitor to China that he opened a bank account there. “When I go over there I don’t have to carry a lot of money with me,” he said in the interview. “If you go over there and you spend some time, you can easily spend a good bit of money.”Ms. Hobbs and Mr. Blankenship formed a business together in 2012, Generator World, to import home generators made in China. According to records from Panjiva, which tracks global trade, a shipment of 386 items was sent from Fuzhou, China, the next year to Ms. Hobbs’s company, Amerasia International.“They arrived and we did sell them, but we didn’t grow the business or continue it,” Mr. Blankenship said. “I wasn’t in a position to do that.” It was a dry reference to his trial, sentence and one-year parole, which will end the day after the May 8 primary.In the absence of much public polling, the clearest sign that Mr. Blankenship is a threat in the race is the hefty advertising budget of national Republicans who seek to disqualify him with voters.Otherwise, signs of his support can be elusive. He draws sparse crowds to his events, and when he appears at multicandidate gatherings, he shows little knack for political skills. Rather than working a room, he keeps to himself, as he did at the Mineral County Lincoln Day dinner on Friday in Keyser.“I don’t think someone who’s on parole at this moment in time should be running for office,” Jessica Imes, a voter at the dinner, said.Mr. Morrisey, the attorney general, moved easily among the party activists dining on stuffed chicken breast and mashed potatoes beneath a giant stuffed moose head at the local Order of Moose hall. His campaign has spent little time attacking Mr. Blankenship, in the belief that primary voters recognize that Republicans should not run a convicted criminal in the general election.“I think he would get crushed in the fall, crushed,” Mr. Morrisey said.“The hypocrisy runs deep in this race,” he added. “He’s a Nevada resident. He abandoned West Virginia when we really needed people to stand up to Barack Obama.”Although Mr. Blankenship maintained in numerous court proceedings that his principal residence was Nevada, he still owns a home in West Virginia, in Mingo County not far from where he was raised. He said he paid property taxes in West Virginia but not income taxes.There is nothing legally barring him from seeking a Senate seat from the state if he declares a primary residence elsewhere.He scoffed at the notion that voters might regard him as an outsider, even a carpetbagger, because he lives mostly in Nevada.“Many people have two homes,” he said. “Most coal miners now have one in Tennessee and one in West Virginia.”"
House Chaplain Was Asked to Resign. He Still Doesn’t Know Why.,"The chaplain of the House said on Thursday that he was blindsided when Speaker Paul D. Ryan asked him to resign two weeks ago, a request that he complied with but was never given a reason for.The sudden resignation of the chaplain, the Rev. Patrick J. Conroy, shocked members of both parties. He had served in the role since he was nominated in 2011 by Speaker John A. Boehner, a fellow Catholic. In an interview, Father Conroy was categorical: His departure was not voluntary.“I was asked to resign, that is clear,” Father Conroy said. As for why, he added, “that is unclear.”“I certainly wasn’t given anything in writing,” he said. “Catholic members on both sides are furious.”Father Conroy said he received the news from Mr. Ryan’s chief of staff. “The speaker would like your resignation,” Father Conroy recalled being told. He complied.“As you have requested, I hereby offer my resignation as the 60th chaplain of the United States House of Representatives,” Father Conroy wrote in a letter to Mr. Ryan several days later. “I wish all the best of the House of Representatives, and for your upcoming search for a worthy successor in the office of the chaplain.”His final day will be May 24.Father Conroy’s resignation is all the more contentious in Catholic circles because Mr. Ryan is a Catholic conservative, whereas Father Conroy is a Jesuit, a branch that is viewed by some as more liberal.Asked whether differences in politics were a factor in his ouster, Father Conroy said: “I do not want to politicize this. I have thoughts about it, but I am not contributing to that.”But, he said, Capitol Hill is an inherently political place. “There are Catholics who are Republicans and there are Catholics who are Democrats,” he said. “I don’t know if there is a religious divide; there certainly is a political one.”Though Father Conroy said he did not know whether politics were behind his departure, he pointed to a prayer he had given on the House floor in November, when Congress was debating tax overhaul legislation.“May all members be mindful that the institutions and structures of our great nation guarantee the opportunities that have allowed some to achieve great success, while others continue to struggle,” he prayed. “May their efforts these days guarantee that there are not winners and losers under new tax laws, but benefits balanced and shared by all Americans.”About a week later, Father Conroy said, he heard from the speaker’s office. “A staffer came down and said, We are upset with this prayer; you are getting too political,” he said. “It suggests to me that there are members who have talked to him about being upset with that prayer.”Shortly after, when he saw Mr. Ryan himself, Father Conroy said that the speaker told him, “Padre, you just got to stay out of politics.”“That is what I have tried to do for seven years,” Father Conroy said. “It doesn’t sound political to me.”“If you are hospital chaplain, you are going to pray about health,” he added. “If you are a chaplain of Congress, you are going to pray about what Congress is doing.”Father Conroy said that was the only time anyone from the speaker’s office had ever chastised him for veering into the political realm. “I’ve never been talked to about being too political in seven years,” he said.A congressional aide for Mr. Ryan said that no specific prayer had led to the decision.Father Conroy said that his only communication with Mr. Ryan or his office since he was asked to resign came on Wednesday morning, when the speaker thanked him for his seven years of service before the House welcomed President Emmanuel Macron of France.Father Conroy said he did not ask Mr. Ryan why he was asked to resign, and he does not plan to contest his departure. “I do not want to debate this,” he said. “My understanding going into this is that I serve at the prerogative of the speaker.”But lawmakers from both parties are demanding answers.Representatives Walter B. Jones, Republican of North Carolina, and Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, are circulating a letter for their colleagues to sign, asking Mr. Ryan for more information.“I’m very upset,” Mr. Jones said. “If this is true about the prayer, and we have freedom of religion in America, how about freedom of religion on the floor of the House?”“The members of the House vote for the chaplain,” he continued. “This is not a one-man decision. The House should have the facts of whatever the problem is.”Mr. Connolly said he was worried about the precedent Mr. Ryan’s decision could set. The letter asks the speaker for a description of the process that was followed, and for a justification of the decision.“We believe that, absent such details, questions will inevitably arise about the politicization of the process for hiring and dismissing a House chaplain,” the letter says. “Not revealing such details could also risk resurrecting prior questions of religious bias.”“Pat is a fairly popular figure in the House,” Mr. Connolly said. “He’s counseled people and tended to their personal and spiritual needs. This is a personal and jarring decision that affects all of us in a big way.”Because of the lack of clarity surrounding his resignation, Father Conroy said that he had been fielding calls from friends and House members, some inaccurately congratulating him on his retirement or worrying that he was sick.“They asked me why I am leaving, why I am abandoning them, congratulations on your retirement, what is next,” he said. “To which I say, ‘I wasn’t looking for a job.’”“For the most part, that information has been met by shock,” he continued. “That is the gratifying part.”Father Conroy said that he had thoroughly enjoyed being the House chaplain, and that he had not politicized his work.“I have found it myself to be personally liberating because I have not been allowed to engage in the politics of the day, which has been very healthy for me,” he said. “I’m grateful that that was my ministry.”When Pope Francis visited the United States in 2015, Father Conroy gave him a personal blessing in Spanish. He has traveled with congressional delegations to Southeast Asia and to the Middle East. He has also acted as personal spiritual adviser to many members of both parties, and to their families.“I’m going to miss that kind of stuff,” Father Conroy said. But, he added, “There will be another ministry.”"
