Alabama Bulls Its Way Past Washington to Reach Title Game,"ATLANTA — Alabama running back Bo Scarbrough sure is going to miss the Georgia Dome.Four weeks after his two-touchdown performance here in a win over Florida in the Southeastern Conference championship game, Scarbrough and the No. 1 Crimson Tide returned to the soon-to-be demolished dome on Saturday and defeated No. 4 Washington, 24-7, in the Peach Bowl, one of the College Football Playoff semifinals.With the win, Alabama (14-0) advanced to the national title game on Jan. 9 in Tampa, Fla., where it will play for its second consecutive championship and its fifth in eight years. The Crimson Tide will face Clemson, which defeated Ohio State, 31-0, in the Fiesta Bowl, the other semifinal, on Saturday night.On Saturday afternoon, Scarbrough, a sophomore from Northport, Ala., who had struggled with injuries and had been a backup for much of the season, was practically unstoppable, as he swerved past defenders and barreled through those he did not manage to evade. He finished with two touchdowns and 180 yards, a career high. Scarbrough had entered the game ranked fourth on the Alabama roster in rushing yards.“Bo has really played well for us, especially the second half of the season, when he got healthy,” Alabama Coach Nick Saban said. “We’ve been playing him more and more, and he has certainly delivered in a really positive way.”Referring to his health, Scarbrough said: “I didn’t let it get to my head. So I just kept working and working, and I overcame the injuries.”Scarbrough’s scores were more than enough to support Alabama’s top-ranked defense, which intercepted two passes by Washington’s star quarterback, Jake Browning, and limited him to 150 yards passing and one touchdown. The Huskies’ offense, which entered the game averaging 466 yards, managed just 194 in the Peach Bowl, a season low.“That’s as good of a defense as there is out there in college football,” Washington Coach Chris Petersen said. “And they played like it.”Early in the game, some Alabama jitters made the Tide’s path to Tampa seem a little less certain.Alabama quarterback Jalen Hurts’s first pass of the game was nearly intercepted, but a Washington defender bobbled the ball, and it hit the ground.Minutes later, Browning connected with wide receiver Dante Pettis on a 16-yard pass into the back corner of the end zone to give Washington (12-2) a 7-0 lead with about eight minutes left in the first quarter. Just like that, the Huskies had become only the third team this season to take a 7-point lead on the Crimson Tide.On its next drive, Alabama gained 78 yards in a nine-play drive that was punctuated by a 18-yard touchdown run from Scarbrough, who ran straight through every would-be tackler in his way and dived over the goal line. He showed no signs of the knee injury that had sidelined him for two games in November.Alabama defensive lineman Dalvin Tomlinson has been subjected to Scarbrough’s bruising momentum in practices, so he could empathize with Washington’s struggles.“If you don’t wrap him up, you’re not going to take him down,” Tomlinson said. “He’s one of those players where you have to hit him two, three, four, five times, and then you’ve got to hit him some more, because he’s not going to give up.”From that point forward, it was Alabama’s game. As the first quarter came to a close, the Crimson Tide recovered a fumble at midfield after defensive back Anthony Averett stripped the ball from Huskies wide receiver John Ross. Alabama then kicked a field goal, taking the lead for good.The defense kept increasing the pressure, and linebacker Ryan Anderson intercepted a pass from Browning, scoring on a 26-yard return to give Alabama a 17-7 lead with a little more than a minute left in the first half.Perhaps Scarbrough’s most consequential run came early in the fourth quarter, deep in his team’s territory. With the Tide pinned on their own 3-yard line on a third-and-9, a safety would have turned the game into a one-possession contest. But just as he had all day, Scarbrough escaped, running 12 yards for a first down.Three plays later, Scarbrough had the ball in his hands again, and he made sure not to relinquish it until he had scored. Scarbrough ran left, broke two tackles that nearly brought him down, dodged two more, and then cut right to sail into the end zone.It was the longest carry by an Alabama running back in any bowl game. It put the game out of reach, 24-7, and brought the heavily pro-Alabama crowd to a deafening roar.Saturday was the final time the 24-year-old Georgia Dome was to host a college football game. Future Peach Bowls will take place at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which is under construction next door.This was the ninth consecutive time Alabama had left the dome with a victory.“What makes it so great is that our fans are always here,” running back Damien Harris said of the stadium, which is a three-hour drive from the Tide’s home in Tuscaloosa, Ala. He added, “Even though things weren’t going our way in the beginning, the energy that the crowd brought helped us continue to push and make those plays.”"
Clemson Pounds Ohio State to Set Up a Rematch With Alabama,"GLENDALE, Ariz. — The goal, Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson said last week, was to “flip the script,” and he wasted no time getting started on the revisions.Clemson’s loss to Alabama in last season’s College Football Playoff national championship game here was as fresh as a bloody turf burn when Watson delivered a promise wrapped inside a post-mortem address.Watson had racked up pinball numbers in the defeat that night, but he said he did not care about statistics, only about winning.“I love my teammates, love my brothers,” Watson added, “and you’ll see us in Tampa next year.”On the same University of Phoenix Stadium field 355 nights later, Watson made good on his pledge, steering Clemson past Ohio State, 31-0, on Saturday in the Fiesta Bowl, a College Football Playoff semifinal.With the victory, Clemson earned a rematch with Alabama — which had earlier beaten Washington in the other semifinal — at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla., on Jan. 9.Clemson dealt Ohio State the first shutout absorbed by an Urban Meyer team in his 194 games as a head coach.Watson passed for 259 yards and a touchdown and rushed for two scores on Saturday to give the Tigers another shot at their first national championship since 1981. His numbers paled next to the 405 passing yards and four touchdowns he had in last season’s title game, but after improving his record as a starter to 31-3, Watson was not complaining.His night got off to an inauspicious start when his first pass attempt, on Clemson’s second play from scrimmage, was intercepted by cornerback Gareon Conley. Watson was also picked off in the end zone in the second quarter on a highlight-reel play by Buckeyes safety Malik Hooker, who swallowed the pass like a frog snaring a fly out of the air.The common criticism of Watson is that he forces passes into tight coverage, which has contributed to his 17 interceptions this season. But the Buckeyes could not capitalize on either turnover on Saturday. Two of their first three offensive possessions ended with missed 45-yard field-goal attempts — the first wide right, the other wide left — by Tyler Durbin, whose struggles seemed to sweep through the Ohio State sideline like a contagion, infecting everybody.The Buckeyes converted only 3 of 14 third downs and had 215 yards of total offense. The defense gave up six plays of 20 yards or more as Watson dissected the Buckeyes like a biology project.In the days leading up to Saturday’s game, Watson said returning to the title game was “a big motivation.” But there was a sense during the semifinal that the national championship trophy was not the only elusive award spurring his play against the Buckeyes, who won the national title two seasons ago. Watson had finished second in the Heisman Trophy balloting to Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson despite passing for 3,914 yards and 37 touchdowns and leading the Tigers to their second consecutive Atlantic Coast Conference title.Watson, a junior who was third in the Heisman voting last season, shrugged off the disappointment of not winning the Heisman, college football’s most coveted individual honor, by saying he wanted the trophy that “nobody votes on.”Whatever his fuel, Watson’s burning desire to extend what is almost surely his final collegiate season blazed throughout a first half in which Clemson jumped to a 17-0 lead. He celebrated the Tigers’ first touchdown, on his 1-yard run, by bringing his index finger up to his lips in a shushing gesture seemingly directed at the Ohio State cheering section, which wrapped the field like a scarf, save for a tight knot of orange-clad Clemson fans.Watson’s scamper, which capped a 10-play, 70-yard drive, came seven minutes after the Tigers had opened the scoring with a 42-yard field goal by Greg Huegel. With less than three minutes remaining in the second quarter, Watson completed a 30-yard teardrop of a touchdown pass to C. J. Fuller, who was wearing an Ohio State defender like a cape. Watson’s pinpoint pass came after he had scrambled for 33 yards, the longest run from scrimmage by either team — and 25 yards more than Ohio State’s combined rushing total in the first half. Watson celebrated that bull’s-eye pass with a bow-and-arrow motion.His third score came on a 7-yard run in the third quarter, finishing off a five-play, 40-yard drive. Watson celebrated with a double-arm motion that was like a raise-the-roof gesture in reverse, as if he were signaling that he was lowering the boom.Watson said he was “just having fun” and added, “It’s hard to score touchdowns, especially against a great defense like theirs.”If Watson’s exuberance rubbed the Ohio State crowd the wrong way, well, now everybody knows how he felt watching Jackson, the Louisville quarterback, celebrate his Heisman win.“I’m the best player in the country,” Watson said a few days after the Heisman voting. “That’s how I think. That’s how I feel.”After the game, however, Watson said that individual accolades were not on his mind.He said he took the field thinking only “to try to be the best I can be.” He added, “It feels great — another opportunity to be in the championship.”"
James Harden Scores 53 as Knicks Drop 4th in a Row,"HOUSTON — James Harden had 53 points, 17 assists and 16 rebounds for his second straight triple-double, and the Houston Rockets beat the short-handed Knicks, 129-122, on Saturday night.Harden set a career highs for points and matched his career best for assists. He passed his previous career best of 51 points on a 3-pointer with 1 minute 16 seconds left, leading to a standing ovation.The Knicks got within 3 points several times in the fourth quarter — the last on a layup by Joakim Noah with about four minutes left. But Harden responded to Noah’s basket with three free throws before dishing to Ryan Anderson for a 3-pointer that put the Rockets up by 119-111.Another 3-pointer by Anderson with less than two minutes left extended the lead to 124-113.Harden, who had 30 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists a 140-116 victory against the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, completed his eighth triple-double of the season when he grabbed his 10th rebound with about 10 minutes left in the third quarter.It was the 17th triple-double of his career and his fourth career 50-point game.The Knicks played without two starters. Kristaps Porzingis sat out with a sore Achilles’ tendon and Courtney Lee missed the game with a sore right wrist. They lost another starter at halftime: Carmelo Anthony missed the second half with a sore left knee. He had 7 points in the first half.Anderson added 25 points for the Rockets, who have won four in a row. Brandon Jennings had a season-high 32 points for the Knicks, who have lost four straight.A 3-pointer by Harden extended Houston’s lead to 18 points with about seven minutes left in the third. Jennings then had 9 points during a 15-5 run that trimmed Houston’s lead to 88-80 with less than four minutes remaining in the quarter, but Harden made two foul shots — he finished 16-for-18 from the line — to give the Rockets a 99-92 lead heading into the fourth quarter."
Blue Jackets Beat Wild in a Game Someone Had to Lose,"Cam Atkinson scored twice, and the visiting Columbus Blue Jackets extended their winning streak to 15 games by stopping Minnesota’s 12-game run with a 4-2 victory over the Wild on Saturday.Never in N.H.L. history had two teams taken such long winning streaks into a game. With the victory, the Blue Jackets matched the second-longest winning streak in league history; they would equal Pittsburgh’s record run from 1993 with two more victories.“We’ve got the right group of guys to do it with,” right wing Josh Anderson said. “Everybody’s positive in the room. We’re all having a bunch of fun.”Columbus goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky made 29 saves, yielding two or fewer goals for the 10th time during the remarkable streak, and defensemen Jack Johnson and Seth Jones each had goals assisted by Brandon Saad in a frenetic second period.Minnesota’s Devan Dubnyk stopped 21 shots but surrendered four goals for the second straight game, after allowing three or fewer in his first 27 appearances.The Blue Jackets’ last loss came in overtime at Florida on Nov. 26. The Wild had not lost since Dec. 2 at Calgary.MANAGING A CHANCE The Carolina Hurricanes signed their equipment manager Jorge Alves to a professional tryout contract to be the backup goaltender for their 3-1 loss at Tampa Bay. Eddie Lack, the regular backup to goaltender Cam Ward, was ill.Alves, 37, did not enter the game. He has been one of Carolina’s full-time equipment managers since the 2012-13 season and practices with the team regularly. He played on North Carolina State’s club hockey team for two years and had several short stints in the professional minor leagues.RANGERS ROLL Chris Kreider got his second career hat trick, J. T. Miller added two goals, and the visiting Rangers beat the Colorado Avalanche, 6-2.Derek Stepan and Mats Zuccarello each had two assists for the Rangers, who have won three straight and nine of their last 12. Henrik Lundqvist returned after missing two games with the flu and stopped 25 shots.Colorado has lost eight of its last nine.AROUND THE N.H.L. John Tavares and Ryan Strome each had a goal and an assist to help the visiting Islanders beat the Winnipeg Jets, 6-2, and climb to .500, at 15-15-6.  Devils defenseman John Moore was taken off the ice on a stretcher after being hit from behind during a 6-2 loss to the visiting Washington Capitals. He was taken to a hospital for evaluation, but Coach John Hynes said Moore would not have to stay.U.S. TOPS CANADA Colin White and Jordan Greenway scored power-play goals, and Joseph Woll had 25 saves to help the United States beat Canada, 3-1, to win Group B at the world junior hockey championship in Toronto. The United States will play Switzerland in the quarterfinals Monday.North Carolina’s big four — No. 5 Duke, No. 9 North Carolina, Wake Forest and North Carolina State — all lost on Saturday, the first time in three years that the state, a hotbed of college hoops, had had such a difficult day in men’s basketball.The Blue Devils fell at Virginia Tech, 89-75, and the Tar Heels lost at Georgia Tech, 75-63. Clemson rallied past the host Demon Deacons, 73-68, and the Wolfpack then capped the state’s 0-for-4 day by losing at Miami, 81-63.The Hokies ended a nine-game losing streak against Duke, which played without Grayson Allen, a preseason all-American who was suspended indefinitely for tripping an Elon player on Dec. 21.Georgia Tech beat the Tar Heels three days after struggling to beat one of their less glamorous neighbors: North Carolina A&T.The last time all four programs lost on the same day was Jan. 11, 2014.VILLANOVA STAYS HOT Jalen Brunson scored a career-high 27 points, and No. 1 Villanova extended its team-record winning streak to 20 games with an 80-70 victory at No. 10 Creighton.Russell Westbrook had 17 points, 14 assists and 12 rebounds for his N.B.A.-leading 16th triple-double of the season, leading the host Oklahoma City Thunder over the Los Angeles Clippers, 114-88.Westbrook played just 28 minutes as Oklahoma City built a 69-40 halftime lead.The Clippers played without Chris Paul, who was sidelined by a hamstring injury, and Blake Griffin, who is recovering from a right knee operation.AROUND THE N.B.A. LeBron James scored 17 of his 32 points in the first quarter, and Cleveland, playing without Kyrie Irving, won at Charlotte, 121-109.  Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 35 points, Jabari Parker added 27, and visiting Milwaukee beat Chicago, 116-96.Derrius Guice rushed for 138 yards, including a 70-yard touchdown run, and caught a scoring pass as No. 19 Louisiana State beat No. 15 Louisville and the season’s Heisman Trophy winner, Lamar Jackson, by 29-9 in the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Fla.The Tigers’ defense completely shut down Jackson, sacking him eight times, including once for a safety in the second quarter. He completed just 10 of 27 passes for 153 yards, and although he led the Cardinals in rushing, he had only 33 yards on 26 carries.Guice stepped in for Leonard Fournette, who skipped the game in preparation for the N.F.L. draft.TAXSLAYER BOWL Dedrick Mills ran for a career-high 169 yards and a touchdown as Georgia Tech beat Kentucky, 33-18, in Jacksonville, Fla.

A Year That Can Never Be Taken From Cleveland,"Any recap of a year in sports demands a great lede, like: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.”But no. We’re talking Cleveland sports.And this year the sun shined almost all the time. The basketball team was tough, the baseball team was smart, and the football team was … the Browns.You may have heard that the Cavaliers beat Golden State in the N.B.A. finals to give Cleveland its first major sports championship since 1964. (If not, let me ask: How was Pluto?) It was sweet to watch a team that had dismissed its coach at midseason and been left for dead in the finals overpower Wardell Stephen Curry II and the All-Galaxy Warriors. (No need to mention that Cleveland has treated the Californians as ginger-haired members of the blended family ever since.)Sweeter still was hearing chants of “Real M.V.P.!” rain down in Quicken Loans Arena every time LeBron James touched the basketball. And that was just June.As a second course, the Indians’ run to the World Series wasn’t ramen noodles. The Depleted Indians’ season — beset by key injuries and held together with baling wire, spearmint gum and Manager Terry Francona’s guile — was carried by a bullpen deeper than the Mariana Trench. The Fall Classic versus the Chicago Cubs didn’t disappoint.Forget that at times the Fox broadcasters sounded as if they were reading from Kyle Schwarber’s Tinder profile. Never mind that Cubs reliever Aroldis Chapman was sputtering in the late innings of Game 7 like the cyborg in “Terminator 3.” Forget even that it took divine intervention in the form of a 17-minute rain delay to keep Chicago from making America Goat Again. The Tribe fell short. And in so doing prevented effigies of Manager Joe Maddon from being hoisted over Wrigley Field instead of a W flag. You’re welcome, Chicago.Any recap of the Cleveland year in sports requires a nod to our largely professional football team. Suffice to say that the Cleveland Browns are the only N.F.L. franchise rumored to offer grocery bags with eye holes as official-team-shop headgear. There is, we are told, a method to the on-field madness, the pot of gold at the end of this awful rainbow being a Santa’s sack of high draft picks. But watching the Browns’ front office evaluate talent is not unlike watching your drunken uncle fire up his Christmas-gift chain saw. Unease is definitely warranted. Remember, this is a team that has been rebuilding since the Visigoths took Rome and the points.Civic types in Cleveland have been floating the notion that our sports success means that, after years of decline, we have finally arrived — championship rings the size of soup tureens being the visible proof of our new place in the leisure-industrial complex. Nonsense. For one thing, it was possible to study a Picasso and spy an Iron Chef in the same evening here long before J. R. Smith ever rode a parade float. And for another, Cleveland — despite efforts to sell bobbleheads and woo conventioneers — remains a city with a chip on its shoulder.We are still a place where old men gather under the onion domes of the Russian Orthodox churches in the Tremont neighborhood and shake fists at the holes in the sky where their steel mills used to be, while swells in martini bars toast the death of smokestack industry.We are still a city where you can spend the house note on dinner at Red the Steakhouse, and where working folks line up before dawn at Slyman’s restaurant for the corned beef they must serve the righteous in the Great Hereafter. Wee morning-drive radio personages mine the city’s history of garish sports gaffes (Hue Jackson’s clock management!), but no one really expects anything worth remembering from Steve-on-a-car-phone.And Cleveland fans still ease their suffering with jokes. (How does a Browns fan count to 10? 0-1, 0-2, 0-3. …)But there is a new buoyancy about town. It is a buoyancy that started between the lines in the ballpark and the basketball arena and has spilled out, largely undiminished, into some of the less scenic corners of the city. You can’t stop hope here. You can’t even contain it.A new year is here, and in town squares everywhere the hardy braved the cold to ring it in. There’s a burg along the Lake Erie shore about an hour from Cleveland where they forgo a ball drop and lower a 600-pound fiberglass walleye instead. Watching a game fish descend out of the dark might not be for everyone, but its unhurried progress allows time to reflect on the past, and the year ahead — like what Edwin Encarnacion’s 40 dingers will mean in the middle of the Indians’ batting order. The wind off the lake will seem gentle. And in 2017 the sun will shine all the time."
"Nick Saban, Thinking Ahead, Builds a Faster Defense to Get Him There","ATLANTA — The most impressive thing about Alabama’s interception for a touchdown on Saturday afternoon — the momentum-swinging score in the Crimson Tide’s 24-7 victory over Washington in a College Football Playoff semifinal at the Peach Bowl — was who made it.It was not one of the Crimson Tide’s cornerbacks or safeties, those long, lanky young men endowed with what is known throughout college football as SEC speed, for the Southeastern Conference, which Alabama has won three straight years. It was not a ballhawk recruited for his swiftness and soft hands.Rather, it was Ryan Anderson, a linebacker listed at 253 pounds who entered the game with 51 tackles. Anderson, a senior, is primarily a pass rusher. He had seven and a half sacks this season, the second most on an Alabama defense that was among the Football Bowl Subdivision leaders in that category. (It was the overall leader in defensive touchdowns, yards per game, rushing yards per game and points per game.)He had been in position to make the interception because his fellow linebacker Reuben Foster had instructed him before the snap to peel off the offensive lineman he was rushing and instead leak outside, toward the sideline. By doing so, Anderson floated directly into the path of Washington quarterback Jake Browning’s short pass. It looked almost as if it had been intended for Anderson, not tailback Lavon Coleman. He caught the pass and fell into Coleman, knocking him over as if he were a tall lamp he had not seen, and kept going, 26 yards to the end zone.“Ryan Anderson being able to drop into coverage and read it shows the type of player he is — very smart and very athletic,” Alabama cornerback Anthony Averett said.But it also showed the type of defense that Coach Nick Saban’s Alabama has — and, more to the point, has become.During the first segment of Alabama’s dynasty — the three national titles won in the seasons from 2009 to 2012 — the Crimson Tide’s defenses sacrificed speed for size, bulldozing teams, holding Louisiana State to no points in one title game and Notre Dame to 14 in the next. In recent years, though, Alabama has come to the realization that speed, even more than size, kills.“I feel like we were a lot faster this game,” said the junior linebacker Rashaan Evans, who had seven tackles and a sack against Washington. “It shows how we adapt to each and every team.”He added: “The offenses are constantly getting faster, so you, as a defense, have to adapt, anyway. I feel like this year, we adapted well to each and every team trying to spread us out.”Many great football coaches are distinguished by specific philosophical bents. Vince Lombardi insisted on running the power sweep to perfection. Bill Walsh innovated the West Coast offense. Bill Parcells demanded toughness.As with Bill Belichick, under whom Saban once served as a defensive coordinator in the N.F.L., Saban’s defining characteristic is an unwillingness to be shaped by a defining characteristic. Much as Belichick moved the New England Patriots from a tidy ball-control offense to an explosive one, and then later redefined the tight end position, Saban sees where the rules, the players and the coaches are taking the game, and then he gets there faster and better than anyone else.“The flexibility of being able to learn from others and change what you do relative to how the game changes is very, very important,” he said Friday.It is because of such flexibility that Alabama (14-0) will face Clemson (13-1) for the national championship on Jan. 9 in Tampa, Fla., in a rematch of last year’s title game, won by Alabama, 45-40.The Crimson Tide could become the first modern team to go 15-0 and the first since World War II to win five national titles in eight seasons.But Clemson promises not to be a pushover. Last year, Alabama required a kick-return touchdown and an extra possession bought by a surprise onside kick to beat the Tigers by a slim margin.This year, Clemson, which repeated as Atlantic Coast Conference champion, looks at least as scary. Behind quarterback Deshaun Watson, a Heisman Trophy finalist for the second year in a row, and with N.F.L.-quality talent at several offensive skill positions, the Tigers averaged more than 40 points a game before Saturday night’s other semifinal. In that game, they hung 31 on Ohio State, which had entered with the third-best scoring defense in the F.B.S.This is the juggernaut the Crimson Tide will have to slow, particularly if their own offense exhibits some of the struggles it did Saturday. Though much attention has been on running back Bo Scarbrough’s breakout day, which involved 180 yards, two touchdowns and some truly remarkable jukes, quarterback Jalen Hurts completed only seven passes for just 57 yards, and his offense converted only four of 14 third-down attempts.Still, Clemson’s offense is the kind that Alabama’s defense was built to defend, with a quarterback who has an accurate arm, fast legs and complex schemes of which to avail himself.The story has been told before: that even amid his current run of dominance, Saban noticed the tendency of quarterbacks like Cam Newton and Johnny Manziel to conquer his otherwise world-beating defenses. So he took a chance on the former wunderkind Lane Kiffin as his offensive coordinator to install fast-paced schemes like the ones that gave Alabama’s defense so much trouble.Less noticed, though, is that with many of the same defensive coaches, Saban also began recruiting a faster kind of defender and using aggressive substitutions to keep those players fresh. Saban had to compromise on size only so much. As the perennial recruiter of No. 1 classes, he was going to get practically whichever players he wanted, anyway.The nose tackle on his 2011 team, Terrence Cody, weighed more than 350 pounds. This year’s starter there, Da’Ron Payne, is around 320, with a 40-yard dash time of less than five seconds.“God is good. God gave a whole bunch of talent. That’s how they all got fast,” said Karl Dunbar, Alabama’s first-year defensive line coach. “And they chose to come to Alabama and not other schools.”Whether God or Saban deserves prime responsibility, Alabama is reaping the rewards."
"After Waiting His Turn, Clemson Defensive End Clelin Ferrell Pounces","GLENDALE, Ariz. — Clelin Ferrell, a redshirt freshman defensive end, described standing on the University of Phoenix Stadium sideline in his Clemson jersey as “a big moment.”“It was like, ‘Wow!’” he said.Ferrell was not talking about Saturday night at the stadium, where he was named the defensive most valuable player for his performance in Clemson’s 31-0 thrashing of Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl, a College Football Playoff semifinal.Ferrell redshirted a year ago, but he said he dressed anyway and warmed up with his teammates before the Tigers lost here to Alabama, 45-40, in last season’s national championship game.“I tried to get as close to the action as I could,” he said.In his playoff debut on Saturday, Ferrell never seemed far from the football. The Ohio State offense had no way to protect against the mayhem he created. Ferrell was a 6-foot-5, 265-pound wrecking ball, finishing with four tackles, including one of the Tigers’ three sacks of Ohio State quarterback J. T. Barrett, in the first shutout of any college team coached by Urban Meyer.Ferrell and his teammates advanced to the Jan. 9 national championship game, where Clemson (13-1) will try to win its first title in 35 years. Standing in the way is Alabama (14-0), which will be taking aim at its fifth national championship in eight seasons.More than any down-home pronouncement by Clemson Coach Dabo Swinney, Ferrell’s monster presence proclaimed the Tigers’ arrival alongside Alabama and Ohio State, the national champion two seasons ago, as a powerhouse. That Clemson could lose two defensive ends, Shaq Lawson and Kevin Dodd, to the N.F.L. and reload like a big-game hunter is a testament to the depth of its talent.“We’re a better team than we were this time last year because we have more competitive depth,” Swinney said. “We have more guys that can go play winning football. Last year, we were very top-heavy. We had a very good first group, but we were a lot of freshmen behind them. And now we’re just more experienced, we have more guys that can go play, and play good, functional, winning football.”Ferrell and company turned the domed University of Phoenix Stadium into a giant beehive, swarming whichever Buckeye had the ball.“They did a good job being disruptive,” said Barrett, who completed 19 of 33 passes for 127 yards, with two interceptions (after throwing only five in 12 regular-season games). “I mean, there was times I could have done a better job getting the ball out, as far as seeing my reads faster. But they definitely — I mean, we just didn’t execute, really, on offense.”Clemson’s redshirt sophomore middle linebacker Kendall Joseph, the second-leading tackler on the team during the regular season, had eight solo tackles, including one that led to a fumble. Defensive tackle Carlos Watkins had two sacks.So dominant was the Clemson defense that the Ohio State offense did not find the red zone until the fourth quarter, and its stay was short. From the Clemson 16-yard line, Ohio State backpedaled, with a false start, an incompletion, a rush for a loss and a 10-yard sack by Watkins. On fourth-and-27, a Barrett pass was intercepted in the end zone by safety Van Smith, who returned it 86 yards to set up the Tigers’ final score.“It was something we really talked about,” Swinney said. “We knew that eventually they would get in the red zone, but let’s play great red-zone defense. And we played great red-zone defense.”Ferrell’s performance was a revelation to none of the teammates who have seen him in practices the past two seasons.“We knew from Day 1 last year, when he came in as a true freshman,” defensive lineman Christian Wilkins said. “Seeing the things that he could do, we were like, ‘This guy’s going to be a really good player.’”Wilkins added, “He’s at his best in big games like this.”Ferrell, 19, is built like a bulldozer, but Clemson linebacker Ben Boulware said Ferrell’s attitude is what sets him apart.“He has that mentality that he wants to dominate every snap,” Boulware said.For someone with that mind-set, it was hard to sit out a season, but Ferrell said he never second-guessed his decision to attend Clemson and wait until the star players ahead of him departed.“Not at all,” said Ferrell, who grew up in Richmond, Va., and seriously considered Virginia Tech. He said he was willing to sit and learn from Lawson and Dodd, whom he described as his brothers.After accepting his defensive award on the field Saturday, Ferrell gave all the credit to his coaches and teammates and said, “We’re playing for something bigger than ourselves.”From watching the Alabama game from the sideline to helping Clemson to a championship rematch against the Crimson Tide, it has been a dizzying 12 months for Ferrell.“It’s kind of crazy, because all the success Alabama’s had over the last couple of years, it’s like, wow, I was just a kid back home watching. And now I get to play against a team that’s one of the top-10 teams for the last 10 years.”Led by youngsters like Ferrell, Clemson has set itself up to be another of those perennial top-10 teams."
Jets Rout Bills; Todd Bowles and Mike Maccagnan Are Expected to Be Retained,"EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Certain aspects of Sunday’s finale against the Buffalo Bills were uncharacteristic of the Jets this season. For one thing, they won, 30-10.They ran the ball extremely well and kept quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick on his feet. The defense muffled the typically high-scoring Bills, who did not have their starting quarterback, Tyrod Taylor, and who lost running back LeSean McCoy to an ankle injury in the first half. Cornerback Darrelle Revis, the Jets’ marquee player of recent years, made his first interception of the season.None of this matched the profile of a team that had underperformed in about every aspect in which performance is analyzed in the sport, which is why the Jets had to clarify after the game that Coach Todd Bowles and General Manager Mike Maccagnan would not be fired.That decision was confirmed by a team employee with knowledge of the plans, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. Several reporters approached the team owner Woody Johnson after the game to ask whether Bowles and Maccagnan would return for a third season, but Johnson walked briskly out of the stadium without commenting.Bowles said Johnson told him last week that his job was secure.“I knew I would be here,” Bowles said. “It really wasn’t a big deal.”But the Jets finished 5-11 after going 10-6 in Bowles’s first season as the coach. The 2015 team just missed the playoffs, while this one ended with a meaningless game in front of a lot of empty seats at MetLife Stadium. Buffalo came in to the game with a better record, 7-8, and had already fired its coach of the past two years, Rex Ryan, who was Bowles’s predecessor.The Jets fired Ryan after a 4-12 season that bore a few too many similarities to this one.On Sunday, there was a devil-may-care attitude in the way both teams played. Or worse. Late in the fourth quarter, the Bills simply let a kickoff bounce into the end zone without touching it, and the Jets recovered it for a touchdown. Effectively, it could be considered a 65-yard onside kick for a score.The Jets twice opted to go for it on fourth down in the red zone, failing both times. Ahead, 10-3, midway through the third quarter and facing a fourth-and-1 from the Bills’ 10, the Jets could have extended the lead with a short field goal. But why not play as if there is no tomorrow? They gave the ball to Bilal Powell on a draw play. He was stuffed, and the drive ended.The Jets managed to get the ball back on the next possession after recovering it after a strip sack of Bills quarterback E. J. Manuel, putting the Jets at the Bills’ 14-yard line. It was just the 12th takeaway of the season for the Jets.Fitzpatrick capped the drive with a 6-yard throw to Jalin Marshall for his 12th touchdown pass of the season — 19 behind the franchise record he set a season ago.Such statistical regressions offer only glimpses into why the Jets struggled this season. .Team chemistry — particularly the relationship between defensive end Sheldon Richardson and wide receiver Brandon Marshall — seemed to curdle early in the season, when the losses piled up.After Sunday’s game, Revis discussed the locker-room argument between Richardson and Marshall after a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in September. That was Week 3. Revis said the team had tried to address the problem, but “eventually it just unraveled for us.”“Moving forward for us as a team, we’ve got to be on the same page,” Revis said.There are plenty of questions about the Jets’ future, including where Revis, a fading superstar at cornerback, might fit. He indicated after the game that he would be willing to consider playing safety.The Jets began the season as the only N.F.L. team with four quarterbacks on their active roster. They wound up using three of them. Christian Hackenberg, the rookie out of Penn State, remained on the sideline Sunday, although he made the active roster for the first time because Bryce Petty had injured a shoulder in last week’s game.But on Sunday, Fitzpatrick needed no backup. He gave a spirited effort (20 of 30 for 210 yards and two touchdowns) in what might have been his final game as a Jet. His 51-yard completion to Quincy Enunwa in the second quarter set up a 2-yard touchdown to Powell and broke a scoreless tie. Marshall, who battled hip and shoulder injuries as the season waned, did not play.Asked if he could still be the Jets’ quarterback next season, Fitzpatrick, who signed a one-year deal this summer, demurred.“I don’t even want to speculate about it,” he said.Likewise Richardson, who was the 13th overall pick of the 2013 draft and has a year left on his contract, indicated that he wanted to be on a very different type of team in the future.“If it’s my time, it’s my time,” Richardson said. “I’ve got a lot of football left in me.”Bowles will be back, and with a heavy workload. He would not say whether he had plans to change any part of the coaching staff.“We’re happy today,” Bowles said. “Going forward, we understand what we have with the 11 losses. But we’re happy with the game today.”"
James Harden Has a Game Worthy of Wilt Chamberlain,"Thunder guard Russell Westbrook may have some competition in his quest to be the N.B.A.’s most valuable player.Westbrook, having a season of amazing statistical achievements, got his league-leading 16th triple-double on Saturday in Oklahoma City’s win over the Los Angeles Clippers. But he was upstaged by a former teammate, Rockets guard James Harden, who had one of the most impressive triple-doubles in N.B.A. history.Little context is needed to highlight Harden’s gargantuan output in a 129-122 victory over the Knicks. In 42 minutes, he had 53 points, 17 assists and 16 rebounds, becoming the first player in N.B.A. history to have 50 or more points and 15 or more assists and rebounds in a single game. That took the spotlight off Westbrook, at least temporarily.Harden had assists on eight 3-pointers, so he had a hand in 95 of Houston’s 129 points, which according to the Elias Sports Bureau is second only to Wilt Chamberlain for combined scoring impact. Chamberlain, in his 100-point game against the Knicks in 1962, had two assists, giving him the record of 104 points that he either scored or assisted on. Kobe Bryant, in an 81-point game against the Toronto Raptors in 2006, also had two assists, one on a 3-pointer, so he accounted for 86 points.“It feels good,” Harden told reporters after the game. “But credit my teammates for knocking down shots and creating that opportunity and space for me to score and to be who I am.”While the frequency of triple-doubles has ebbed and flowed over the years, they are definitely flowing this season, with 38 entering Sunday. Harden’s feat was especially notable because of the high point total.Westbrook’s 51-point triple-double in the Thunder’s second game this season was the first for a player who eclipsed 50 points since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1975. While game logs from the early days of the N.B.A. can be scarce or incomplete, Elgin Baylor and Chamberlain are thought to have had at least two 50-point triple-doubles each, and Richie Guerin of the Knicks is credited by many with a 50-point triple-double in a win over the Philadelphia Warriors in 1962, a game in which Chamberlain had 67 points.Harden can lay claim to the N.B.A.’s only 50-15-15 game, and some are calling it the most dominant triple-double ever. But like so many before him, Harden most likely has to bow before the greatness of Chamberlain.On March 18, 1968, Chamberlain’s Philadelphia 76ers crushed the visiting Los Angeles Lakers, 158-128. While rebound and assist totals from that era are not official, Chamberlain was credited with 53 points, 32 rebounds and 14 assists. He might have had a quadruple- or quintuple-double if blocks and steals had been accurately tracked in that era.Having a game that rivaled some of Chamberlain’s best is another feather in Harden’s cap as he makes a case for himself as the league’s M.V.P.Harden and Westbrook are among the leading contenders, and the numbers for both players are staggering. Westbrook is averaging 30.9 points, 10.7 assists and 10.5 rebounds with a player-efficiency rating of 30.4 and 16 triple-doubles. Harden is averaging 28.5 points, 12 assists and 8.1 rebounds a game with a player-efficiency rating of 28.8 and 8 triple-doubles.But based on Houston’s 26-9 record, which has the team in third place in the Western Conference, Harden did not hesitate in a recent interview with Sports Illustrated to say who would deserve the league’s top award.“The Beard,” Harden said, using his nickname. “Look at our record. Obviously the numbers, historic numbers. Just my performance overall.”Harden may have some work to do to back up that claim, but on Saturday night it was hard to argue that he had not one-upped Westbrook, and their friendly duel will be one of the more entertaining things to watch as the season continues."
"N.F.L. Playoffs: Schedule, Matchups and Odds","When the Green Bay Packers lost to the Washington Redskins in Week 11, dropping to 4-6, Aaron Rodgers vowed to “run the table” in a march to the playoffs. With a 31-24 victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday night, the team fulfilled Rodgers’ promise.Much of the drama of the matchup between division rivals was eliminated earlier in the day when the Redskins lost to the Giants, thus guaranteeing both the Packers and Lions would be playoff teams, but the N.F.C. North bragging rights, and a home game in the first round of the playoffs, were sufficient motivation for Green Bay to push hard enough to secure the team’s sixth consecutive win and the third consecutive loss for Detroit.Pundits had spent the week deciphering all of the wild scenarios that could play out for positioning among the remaining teams. But when all was said and done, ten of the teams that were in line for a playoff spot remained in the same seeding order.No. 6 Detroit Lions at No. 3 Seattle SeahawksTime: 8:15 p.m. Eastern SATURDAY on NBCThe Seahawks’ title hopes took a crushing blow when Earl Thomas was lost for the season with a broken leg. After the injury, the Seahawks went 2-2, with the wins coming with major asterisks as they came against the bottom-feeding Rams and 49ers. That collapse paled in comparison to the Lions, who lost their final three games, blowing what had been a large division lead against Green Bay.Line: Seahawks -7 (Over/under: 43)No. 5 Giants at No. 4 Green Bay PackersTime: 4:40 p.m. Eastern SUNDAY on FoxThanks to playing in the N.F.C. East, home of the top-seeded Dallas Cowboys, the Giants managed to tie Atlanta for the second-best record in the N.F.C. but got stuck with the No. 5 seed in the playoffs and a road game against a red-hot Packers squad that won its final six games. The good news for the Giants is that superstitious fans will note that the last two times they played the Packers on the road in the playoffs, they not only won the games but went on to win the Super Bowl both times.Line: Packers -4 (Over/under: 44.5)Bye weeks: Dallas, AtlantaNo. 5 Oakland Raiders at No. 4 Houston TexansTime: 4:35 p.m. Eastern SATURDAY on ESPNLine: Texans -3 (Over/under: 37)The Texans were the least inspiring of the N.F.L.’s division champions and that was complicated further when Tom Savage, whom the team had elevated to starting quarterback after the benching of Brock Osweiler, was forced to leave Week 17’s loss to Tennessee with a concussion. As bad as that sounds, it may still be enough against a reeling Oakland squad that lost Derek Carr to a broken leg in Week 16, Matt McGloin to a shoulder injury in Week 17, and fell all the way from the No. 2 seed in the A.F.C. to No. 5. It is unclear at this point if McGloin or rookie Connor Cook will start at quarterback against Houston.No. 6 Miami Dolphins at No. 3 Pittsburgh SteelersTime: 1:05 p.m. Eastern SUNDAY on CBSThe Dolphins were a contender when the team’s quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, was lost in Week 14 with injured ligaments in his left knee. Thanks to backup quarterback Matt Moore, and Jay Ajayi, the team’s 1,272-yard running back, they won two of three games and secured a wild-card berth. But going up against a top-flight offense like Pittsburgh is a tough test for Miami’s middling defense, even if Tannehill’s knee heals enough to allow him to return.Line: Steelers -9.5 (Over/under: 47.5)Bye weeks: New England, Kansas CityWith four teams vying for two N.F.C. playoff spots, all eyes were on the Giants-Redskins game on Sunday. A Redskins victory could have caused movement in the seedings, with the Lions and Packers playing a win-or-go-home evening matchup.The Giants, who had already locked up the No. 5 seed and had nothing to gain, threw a wrench in the Redskins’ plans, eliminating their division rivals with a decisive 19-10 victory.With the drama essentially taken out of the N.F.C., all of the playoff movement Sunday occurred in the A.F.C. where there was a flip-flop at the top of the standings in the A.F.C. West.Just a week after losing Derek Carr, the team’s quarterback and a legitimate candidate for most valuable player, to a broken leg, the Oakland Raiders were crushed 24-6 by the Denver Broncos. That, combined with the Kansas City Chiefs’ 37-27 victory over the San Diego Chargers vaulted the Chiefs from a wild-card spot all the way to the No. 2 seed in the A.F.C., which comes with a first-round bye in the playoffs. The loss for Oakland added to the misery of the Raiders, who have gone from Super Bowl contenders last week to a wild-card team that will play on the road in Houston next week potentially with a third-string quarterback under center as Carr’s backup, Matt McGloin, injured his shoulder in the loss to the Broncos.Beyond the switch to the Chiefs as the No. 2-seed in the A.F.C., it was business as usual for the teams that will get bye weeks in the playoffs. The New England Patriots secured the No. 1 spot in the A.F.C. with a win over Miami, the Dallas Cowboys were already guaranteed the No. 1 spot in the N.F.C. before their loss to Philadelphia, and the Atlanta Falcons held onto the No. 2 seed in the N.F.C. with a 38-32 win over New Orleans.The only remaining chance for a minor shake-up was for the Packers, who led their division by virtue of a tiebreaker, to lose to the Lions, which would have forced them to play on the road in the wild-card round of the playoffs. But the winner-take-all aspect of the de facto N.F.C. North championship went away when the Redskins lost to the Giants, which eliminated the Redskins from wild-card contention.While most of the races were straight forward, one of the crazier playoff scenarios that had been discussed before the week was the possibility that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could find themselves in the playoffs. They simply had to shoot the moon by beating the Carolina Panthers, having the Redskins tie the Giants, the Packers lose to the Lions, and should all of that happen they simply required wins by Indianapolis, Dallas, Tennessee and San Francisco to top the Packers in strength of schedule. Tampa Bay took care of their end by beating the Panthers early in the day, but they were eliminated officially when Dallas lost to Philadelphia."
"In Navajo Nation, a Basketball Elder Earns Respect","More than 60 years ago, an American Indian boy climbed a mountain and peered across the Sonoran Desert. He saw the shimmering reflection of the Gulf of California and wondered about the world beyond. Then he returned to picking cotton in the fields of southern Arizona, where the summer sun pounded like a hammer on his back.The boy turned 7, and his grandmother told him to board a school bus. You will be the first in our family to get an education. Yes, Grandma. That rickety bus bounced and jounced along dirt roads and pulled into an Arizona elementary school.The boy, Raul Mendoza, spoke some Spanish and the language of his tribe, the Tohono O’odham, whose lands are in southern Arizona and northern Mexico. He found himself in a strange world.CHINLE, Ariz. — Winter night fell like a blanket across the Navajo reservation and this town that sits at the mouth of Canyon de Chelly, the spiritual heart of this land.I stepped inside a cavernous high school arena and saw a basketball team from Holbrook, Ariz., running and passing and pressing, threatening to push the hometown team into a ditch.At halftime, the players from Chinle retreated, glum, to their locker room, 7 points down.Their coach walked in. Silver-haired, wearing a gray dress shirt and black pants and a tie, he did not yell or pound his fist. His intensity was unmistakable. He looked at a lean sapling of a forward and asked quietly: “Elijah, you tired? No mas?” Then to his freshman wunderkind, “Cooper, are you ready to play now?”He turned to the blackboard and drew plays and defensive sets. His is a young team, his best players a freshman and a sophomore, and he is a coach who never stops teaching.“Holbrook is going to keep coming after you. They won’t let down.”The coach knew whereof he spoke. He achieved success coaching at Holbrook, on the border of the Navajo Nation, until he retired a few years back and his former assistant took over. To look at that team’s style was to see a doppelgänger of his team in Chinle.The coach made sure his boys’ eyes were fixed on his own.“There’s no limit to what we can accomplish if we don’t care who gets credit,” he told them.The players put fists together, chanted, “Share sugar!” and loped onto the floor. “What’s with share sugar?” I asked. The coach, Raul Mendoza, shrugged and laughed.“I have no idea. I’m 69, man. I just need them to cut and pass more.”Mendoza, who long ago left the Tohono O’odham Nation, has nearly 700 career wins, two Coach of the Year Awards and a state championship to his credit. He is a revered coach on a reservation where hoops are a cousin to religion. Reservation basketball, called rez ball, is a sneaker-squeaking, whirling-dervish style of play. Its secrets are passed from grandfather to auntie to son.Chinle’s population is 4,518. About 3,500 fans attended this midweek game, grandmothers wrapped in traditional blankets, aunts and uncles, and coquettish teenage girls. The boys are expected to wear dress shirts and ties to games, and no matter how humble their family finances, they look dapper.The Chinle boys’ team, the Wildcats, stumbled last year to a record of 4-17. Officials persuaded Mendoza, then coaching at Window Rock, Ariz., to take control in Chinle. Mendoza and I met a few years back, and he invited me to look in on his rebuild. I figured, why not?This was my chance to put a shovel into the soil of rez ball, to explore the lives of these Navajo boys and their families. And it was a chance to explore what drives this man and his passion for counseling and teaching hoops in this achingly beautiful land.I hopped a flight and drove to the Navajo Nation.Decades ago, I traveled here with my wife, Evelyn, and our young sons. We lived in a trailer. Evelyn, a midwife, delivered babies for the Indian Health Service. On days off, we put Aidan, the baby, on my back, she held the hand of 5-year-old Nick and we descended into Canyon de Chelly, where, for centuries, Navajos farmed, chanted prayers and hid from white invaders. Crows soared above sandstone walls as we ran our hands along petrified sand dunes and felt cool mystery.A mile from that canyon, I sat in a diner and talked with Mendoza. He has coached Native American teams for 35 years. He tried to retire, but mistress basketball tugged him back. To work here is exhilarating and exhausting. After wins, Navajos shake his hand at gas stations and the supermarket. After losses, some mutter, questioning plays and substitutions.His boys hail from many corners of this largest of reservations. (The Navajo Nation sits a mile above sea level and sprawls across three states. It is the size of Massachusetts, Vermont and Connecticut combined.)Nachae Nez, a 5-foot-9 senior shooting guard, played in Holbrook as a freshman. While there, he spun to the hoop and tore up his knee. He is studious, and he figured academics were his way out, so he enrolled at Navajo Preparatory School in Farmington, N.M.Nez rebuilt his knee and led Prep in scoring. Then his mother was laid off from a flour plant, and they were evicted from their home. He returned to Chinle for his senior year. He still has eyes on college.“I want to get a degree in agriculture and serve my people,” Nez said as we sat in the stands.Angelo Lewis wandered by. A 6-foot-3 sophomore with broad shoulders, he has a deft passing touch. Lewis had called Mendoza. He could not start his grandfather’s pickup truck and feared missing practice.“Check the battery and alternator,” Mendoza replied.Lewis made it. Distances are daunting. Mendoza put 90,000 miles on his car during the past two years.Cooper Burbank is the freshman starter. He is 6 feet 1 and rawboned, with a preternatural ease on the court. He grew up in Red Mesa, Ariz., a dot in the desert plains. His middle school had a student population of 108. His mother, Joni Burbank, a teacher, wanted her son to go college and worried that he needed a bigger challenge.A freshman starter from a distant town could stir unease in older teammates.“Sometimes, change is uncomfortable,” Joni Burbank said. “We need to face that, so that it sets us up for bigger and better things.”We will hear more of these boys in February. This is the tale of their maestro, Mendoza. He is one-quarter Mexican and three-quarters Tohono O’odham.His mother and father had troubles and abandoned him as a baby with his grandmother, who lived in Mexico. In the summer and autumn, she picked cotton in Arizona, and Raul worked alongside her, a child bent over in the fields.“A good picker made nine dollars a day,” Mendoza said. “I said to myself, ‘No way I’m doing this all my life.’”Then his grandmother ordered him to board that school bus. An American teacher asked his name.“I said ‘Carlos Lopez’ because he was the kid sitting next to me,” Mendoza said. “I failed first grade because I didn’t speak English.”His grandmother died when he was in the seventh grade. He met his father just once before he died. Mendoza remained in Arizona to attend high school.What propelled him along that path? Mendoza shrugged — a portion of our lives remains a mystery. As a senior, he told a counselor, “I want to go to college.” The counselor laughed at him.Mendoza took a battery of tests and aced math. He applied to a college and was awarded grants. He met his wife, Marjorie, a Navajo, in college. She got pregnant, and they dropped out. Mendoza worked in a factory, making $30,000 a year.It was good money, yet again he felt an ache: He wanted to coach and teach children to navigate new worlds. When he quit his factory job, his friends hooted: “You’re crazy! You won’t make any money teaching!”He paused, laughing.“Sure enough, my first job at Window Rock, I made $9,500 a year.”Mendoza has worked ever since as a guidance counselor and coach in the Navajo Nation and the Apache Nation in the White Mountains. His wife teaches on the reservation.These nations are bounded by mountains and forests and buttes, with embracing clans, leaders and spiritualism woven deep. Each is poor, plagued by alcoholism and drug abuse and fractured families.Mendoza posted winning seasons in the Apache Nation. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar served as his assistant coach one year, a not entirely satisfactory experience. Mendoza hoped that Abdul-Jabbar, an N.B.A. great who was a student under the Hall of Fame coach John Wooden, would teach a few tricks to the students.“There were a lot of media distractions,” Mendoza said. “I asked him to teach a tall kid the drop step. Jabbar looked at me and said, ‘The boy doesn’t want to do that.’”Mendoza laughs. Humor is his salve.The Apache reservation suffered an epidemic of teenage suicide. Mendoza is a master at infusing the rez ball whirlwind with offensive and defensive discipline. His proudest accomplishment, however, was this: None of his teenagers took their own lives.“I told the kids, ‘I understand, I knew fear,’” he said. “I learned how anger can affect you.”He came to reckon with the power of magic, which he declines to dismiss as superstition. Mysticism and hexes and sorcerers are the stuff of daily life here. Mendoza saw the eyes of a sober man roll back in his head in the Apache Nation, a sign an astral self might be roaming. During a game, he and his players experienced a strange delirium. He was told later that magic dolls — kachinas — had been secreted into the arena. Belief in the unseen is palpable, a collective consciousness powerful and present.Once, his best Apache player began to drink a lot.What, Mendoza asked, is the matter?“Three shadows follow me,” the boy replied. “One is tall and stands by the basket and swats the ball away. A short one stops my passes. The middle one makes me anxious. I can’t take it anymore.”Mendoza brought in an Apache crown dancer to purify the gym, and kept talking with that teenager. The shadows slipped away.In the Navajo Nation, many families and children are known as traditionals, and they embrace spiritual teachings. I talked to Chinle’s athletic director, Shaun Martin. He is educated, a leader, a world-class ultramarathoner and a traditional believer.A Navajo, he said, strives for hozho — balance — in a world where canyons, coyotes, the sky and turtles are considered equally alive.“Call it chi, call it karma, hozho is how we understand our way in this world,” Martin said. “A teenager, who is aware but not yet in command, worries about hexes.”Were your long wanderings in this world difficult on your family, I asked Mendoza.He clasped his hands.“It backfired on me,” he said quietly.“My kids were out of high school before I realized that I’d missed them,” he said. “My older daughter was very angry.”He spent hours talking with his daughter, hearing of her hurt. He felt the presence of his own shadows.“I told her I had no father — I didn’t know how to become one,” he said.Without guidance, the guidance teacher had been lost.Those shadows receded. The eldest daughter lives in the Mendozas’ house in Holbrook, and frequently Mendoza and his wife drive 200 miles round trip from their apartment in Chinle to see her and their grandchildren.“I tell my players, you must — must — learn all the time,” he said.The Wildcats came roaring back against Holbrook. Burbank, the freshman, nailed jumpers, and Lewis made handsome post passes. They scored a resounding victory.They played the next night against their reservation rival Tuba City (a 280-mile round trip). Play was quicksilver, the pace unrelenting. As in hockey, players entered and exited in shifts.Tuba City won a taut game. Chinle’s record stood at 5-3, barely good enough in a crowded bracket.“We shot ourselves in the foot,” Mendoza tells his boys. “We got selfish.”Another game loomed against the archrival Window Rock. Mendoza called off practice and told his players to reflect. We walked outside, and Mendoza raised his face to the moon and smiled. There are crucibles harsher than a lost game.We shook hands and spoke goodbyes.I awoke the next day at 5 a.m. and drove south out of the Navajo Nation, to where the road dips through piñon and red pine forests toward Phoenix. I found a Native American radio station; I heard rhythmic chants and flutes and poems to greet the glimmering dawn.In two months, I will return to see what has become of Mendoza and his teenage charges."
"Raiders Manage to Play Without Derek Carr, but Only Barely","DENVER — The craziest thing happened at Sports Authority Field on Sunday. The Oakland Raiders slipped on their pads, donned their uniforms and summoned the fortitude to play. It was a lot for them after having lost quarterback Derek Carr to a broken leg last week, but since his backup, Matt McGloin, was available, the Raiders figured they might as well give this football thing another try.The outcome, a 24-6 loss to the Denver Broncos, reinforced Carr’s value. It corroborated all that the Raiders had tried to dispel over the past week, after Carr’s injury ruined his superlative season, upended the A.F.C. hierarchy and dampened a renaissance delayed by years of mismanagement and futility.What had been an opportunity for the Raiders to prove that they could compartmentalize and that their defense and running game could bolster McGloin and mitigate Carr’s absence instead devolved into a teamwide malfunction. In the first half, Oakland recorded three first downs, ceded 255 yards — a ghastly 7.7 per play — and committed nine penalties. The Raiders finished 2 of 11 on third down, had three turnovers and managed a season-low 221 total yards.Asked if Carr’s injury had affected the Raiders’ morale, Coach Jack Del Rio said he understood how the team’s performance could prompt that kind of question.“We’re big boys,” Del Rio said. “We can take it like men and move on.”Added receiver Amari Cooper: “Our heads shouldn’t be down. We’re still going to the playoffs.”That the Raiders are, though they do so as a team severely compromised, their league-leading seven Pro Bowlers be damned. One of them, of course, was Carr, who had guided Oakland to its first playoff berth since a loss in the Super Bowl in 2002.The next 13 seasons passed with the Raiders never winning more than eight games, never finishing higher than third in the four-team A.F.C. West. This season, buttressed by Carr, Oakland featured one of the few offenses capable of challenging top-seeded New England in the conference. The Raiders rampaged to 12 victories, positioning themselves, with a win Sunday, for a division title, a first-round bye and — not insignificantly for a team facing potential relocation to Las Vegas — a home playoff game.But this defeat, coupled with Kansas City’s victory in San Diego, dropped the Raiders to the No. 5 seed, sending them to Houston next weekend with their quarterback situation in flux again.McGloin played four drives, all resulting in punts, before leaving with a left shoulder injury that may or may not hinder his availability for the Texans. He finished 6 of 11 for 21 yards.“I plan on being 100 percent healthy,” said McGloin, whose imprecision was most apparent on his final series. On three consecutive plays, he overthrew receivers, including Cooper, who almost certainly would have scored a long touchdown.Replacing McGloin, Connor Cook lost a fumble that produced a touchdown that widened Oakland’s deficit to 24-0. Cook said he was “running plays that I’ve never really ran before,” but he later found Cooper on a 32-yard touchdown that was cosmetic.“Based on our guys, it surprised me,” Del Rio said of the Raiders’ ineffectiveness. “The way we’ve been rolling, it surprised me.”The cold calculus of the N.F.L. devalues its players, who subscribe to that hackneyed next-man-up mantra. They would never say that not having a marquee player devastates their prospects because that would reveal weakness. It would disrespect that next man up.Such as McGloin, a respected reserve who had not started in three seasons, whom Del Rio characterized as “a little bit fearless.” Or Cook, who had not appeared in a N.F.L. game before Sunday.Other playoff-bound teams have lost quarterbacks to injury — the Miami Dolphins with Ryan Tannehill, for instance — but Oakland’s plight, without Carr, is unprecedented. As Adam Schefter of ESPN posted on Twitter last week, and as the Elias Sports Bureau later confirmed, Carr will be the only quarterback to win at least 12 regular-season games and not start in the postseason.From an emotional standpoint at least, the 2005 Bengals could empathize. Like these Raiders, Cincinnati had not reached the playoffs in more than a decade, and when that day came, after a 15-year wait, quarterback Carson Palmer blew out his knee on the second offensive play.“As much as you say you have faith,” the former Bengals receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh said in a telephone interview, “it affects you.”The 1990 Giants may be a model for Oakland, considering the circumstances. The Giants were 11-3 when quarterback Phil Simms went on injured reserve with a foot injury and was replaced by Jeff Hostetler, who led them to five consecutive victories, including a Super Bowl win over Buffalo.But even then, there is an important distinction. The Giants’ offense accentuated their rushing game, not their quarterback.“We played three tight ends and went to heavy packages when we were in the game just to beat you down physically,” Howard Cross, a tight end on that team, said in an interview last week at Giants headquarters in East Rutherford, N.J. “Third and 2 or 3, we’re running. You throw the ball to get the first down, too many bad things could happen.”The propagation of spread offenses transformed the N.F.L. into a passing league, and that evolution has put more of an onus on quarterbacks. Carr embraced that responsibility, throwing 28 touchdowns to six interceptions and engineering seven fourth-quarter comebacks.That resilience can permeate a team, the expectation that the quarterback can compensate for deficiencies elsewhere — a struggling defense, a slogging rushing attack — and will it to victory. The Raiders, after trailing by 17 points at halftime, needed one of those revivals Sunday. They will need more than that next week.“The one thing about this team is enough players in that locker room know what it’s like to lose, what it’s like to pack their bags in January and head home, and have been around a building that hasn’t been a pleasant place to be around the last several years,” Rich Gannon, the last quarterback to play for Oakland in the postseason and now an analyst for CBS, said in a telephone interview last week. “They don’t want to go back to that.”Unless the Raiders regroup, unless they remember how to effectively run and pass and play defense, they might not have a choice."
Reggie Bush Ran This Season. Just Not Always Forward.,"With their game against the Miami Dolphins in overtime on Christmas Eve, the Buffalo Bills tried a reverse to Reggie Bush. It did not work out. Bush lost 8 yards, and the Bills lost the game. The team was eliminated from the N.F.L. playoffs, and Coach Rex Ryan was fired.The reverse also brought one more bit of infamy to the Bills this season. It meant that Bush finished with minus-3 rushing yards on the year, becoming the first non-quarterback since 1961 to have 10 or more rushing attempts and yet end up in the negative column.A superstar at the University of Southern California, Bush won the Heisman Trophy in 2005, though he later relinquished it over N.C.A.A. violations. His rushing yardage in his final season there was decidedly positive: 1,740 yards.The Saints drafted Bush with the No. 2 overall pick, and he remains the last running back to be selected so high. He never quite took off in five years in New Orleans, but he had a few good seasons, including two with more than 1,000 yards, with the Dolphins in 2011 and the Detroit Lions in 2013. At 31, he signed with the Bills this season as a backup.Bush appeared in 13 games but was never a key player, mostly being handed the ball only once or twice a game. Unfortunately, some of those rushes went in the wrong direction.After rushing for three times for minus-4 yards in the opener, Bush clawed his way back to plus-6 after a loss to Miami on Oct. 23. Two rushes for minus-8 yards against the New England Patriots the next week put him back in the red.A couple of rushes in early December pushed him up to plus-5. But then came the fatal reverse. Bush finished the season at minus-3 on 12 carries, 1,634 behind the league’s rushing leader, Ezekiel Elliott, of the Dallas Cowboys.The last player to make no forward progress despite being handed the ball 10 or more times was John Adams, who managed minus-2 yards on 14 rushes with the 1961 Chicago Bears. Adams was never handed the ball again, although he caught 14 passes over the next two seasons playing end.Before Sunday’s game against the Jets, Bush professed unconcern about his ignominious mark.“I’m not worried about that, finishing with negative yards or anything like that,” he told The Buffalo News. “If I had more opportunities, it would be a different story. But I didn’t have that.” Bills coaches even spoke of trying to get Bush a few carries to put him over the top.It didn’t happen. Bush never saw the ball on Sunday.It was a mediocre year for the Bills, who finished 7-9 and missed the playoffs for the 17th straight season, the longest drought in major North American sports. That cost Ryan his job as head coach after just two seasons.On the plus side, Bush did get 90 yards receiving on seven catches. And he even had a 1-yard touchdown in the Oct. 23 Dolphins game. But it must feel like a long way from the Heisman Trophy.Even as a backup, Bush was paid $1.5 million this season. That works out to $500,000 per negative yard."

Hall of Fame Voters Soften Stance on Stars of Steroids Era,"Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, two of the most successful players in baseball history, are among the former stars who were essentially blacklisted from the Hall of Fame because of their reputations as doping cheats. But now it appears that such players might end up enshrined in Cooperstown after all.In a sudden and surprising shift of sentiment, the baseball writers who vote to decide who should be inducted into the Hall, and who should not, appear to be backing away from their punitive approach to Bonds and Clemens, and perhaps others as well.Were Bonds and Clemens to actually end up in the Hall, it would be a striking moment for the sport and its millions of fans. No team sport in the United States has as much tradition as baseball does, nor does any other sport have a Hall of Fame that carries nearly as much prestige as the one in Cooperstown.And no team sport in this country has been as vexed by the issue of doping as baseball has. For better or worse, baseball has often served as the American battleground over the issue of doping, with the sport’s officials slow to confront the problem during the so-called steroid era and then eventually becoming more aggressive than other leagues in cracking down.All of this created considerable anguish in baseball and a seeming consensus that even players as good as Bonds, the career leader in home runs, and Clemens, an intimidating strikeout artist who won a colossal 354 games, should be kept out of the Hall if they were directly linked to performance-enhancing drugs.But that consensus is cracking. Part of the reason is that the hundreds of writers who vote are, as a whole, becoming younger and seemingly less inclined to take an unyielding stance on steroid cheats.And part of the reason appears to be the decision last month to induct Bud Selig into the Hall. Selig, who served as commissioner of baseball as the record books were being obliterated by bulked-up players, was granted entry into Cooperstown by a veterans’ committee that is separate from the writers’ bloc.Selig had long been criticized for failing to combat the doping scourge sooner. Now he was headed to Cooperstown, joining, among others, the former manager Tony La Russa, who was inducted in 2014 and who oversaw a number of highly successful teams that benefited from the presence of steroid users.All of it “just kind of struck a nerve with me,” said Kevin Cooney, a voter from The Courier Times in Bucks County, Pa.“To me, it would be hypocritical to put the commissioner of the steroid era and a manager who had connections with the steroid era in and leave out the greatest pitcher and the greatest hitter of that time,” Cooney said in explaining why he had now decided to vote for Bonds and Clemens.Another writer, Susan Slusser of The San Francisco Chronicle, posted a pointed message on social media after Selig’s induction. In it, Slusser, a former president of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America, said the induction had now compelled her to reconsider how she would vote on this year’s ballot for the Hall.She argued that if Selig was being inducted, it was “senseless” to keep out players who were accused of using drugs.As a longtime beat writer for The Chronicle, Slusser is well respected by her fellow writers. Her statement got their attention and seemed to contribute to the shift now taking place.“There is nothing good about the whole era,” Slusser said in a telephone interview. “And I just decided that if you honor the central figures of the era — the execs and managers and players and media people are all going in — then it’s putting the entire wrongs of that era on two guys.”Other voters clearly share Slusser and Cooney’s thinking, and that shift is reflected in the vote totals tabulated on Ryan Thibodaux’s BBHOF ballot tracker, which lists Hall of Fame ballots that writers have made public in advance of the announcement of the final vote totals later this month.Of the more than 150 voters who have taken the public route — representing a little over a third of the electorate — 21 voted for Bonds for the first time after previously declining to do so, and 22 did the same for Clemens.That growing support has left Bonds and Clemens closing in on the 75 percent threshold needed for induction. As of Monday evening, each had been named on 111 of the 158 ballots on Thibodaux’s site, or 70.3 percent.Based on previous voting patterns, the percentages for Bonds and Clemens are expected to come down some — to somewhere above 60 percent — when all the votes are tabulated. Still, a pathway to induction has come into focus for the two men midway through their 10 years of ballot eligibility.Last year, Clemens received 45.2 percent of the vote and Bonds 44.3. It was the best they had done to date, but still far short of where they needed to get. But if they can get over 60 percent this time, with five more years left on the ballot, they may pick up enough momentum to eventually get the necessary three-quarters of the vote. Other players have followed a similar trajectory into the Hall.Then again, other players do not carry the baggage that Bonds and Clemens do. Not only were they linked to illicit drugs, but both ended up facing criminal charges that they lied about their drug use in legal settings.Bonds was charged with perjury and obstruction of justice for statements he made before a federal grand jury and was initially convicted of the latter charge before the verdict was overturned. Clemens, whose denial of drug use led to a nationally televised hearing before a congressional panel, was ultimately acquitted of perjury and other charges in a federal trial.But even with all those unsettling facts to consider, some writers are changing their minds.Steve Buckley of The Boston Herald said he pictured himself sitting in the audience at Cooperstown for future induction ceremonies and looking out at Selig and La Russa and others who he said benefited from the steroid era and wondering why the two best players of the time were barred.“I’m not saying Bud turned a blind eye to it or that he knew it was happening,” Buckley said of the drug use under Selig’s watch. “I’m simply saying that Clemens and Bonds and others took the performance-enhancing drugs and did the steroids and all those evil things, and at the end of the day, the game did prosper, and they are on the outside looking in, and I have an issue with that.”But then there is Gordon Wittenmyer of The Chicago Sun-Times, who did not vote for Bonds or Clemens this time, either, and who said that comparing Selig to the two former stars did not make sense.He recalled that before his first vote a few years ago, when another tainted slugger, Mark McGwire, was still on the ballot, he described the voting process to his son, who was 12 at the time. Wittenmyer described each player’s biography and what he had seen from them up close as a writer. Then he explained the steroid issue.“His response was, ‘Well, Dad, isn’t that cheating?’ And I said, ‘Yeah, it was,’” Wittenmyer said. “If that’s the easy conclusion a 12-year-old draws, it really is that simple.” But how many voters still feel like Wittenmyer has become an intriguing question."
Jets Say Their Goodbyes After a Season of Losses and Bickering,"FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick has always likened the day after the last game of the season to the final day before school lets out for the summer. He felt only slightly different Monday.“Maybe it’s like eighth grade, where everyone isn’t going to the same high school,” Fitzpatrick said.After a 5-11 season, changes will be demanded of the Jets. As players arrived to collect their belongings from the team’s practice center, some exchanged goodbyes, unsure if they would be back here in the spring.Coach Todd Bowles and General Manager Mike Maccagnan are expected to return; that much is clear. But they will have to clean up a locker-room chemistry experiment that exploded as the pressure of losing intensified.The problems apparently began in Kansas City, in September, when frustration after a bad loss boiled over into a verbal spat between receiver Brandon Marshall and defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson. Cornerback Darrelle Revis, one of the team’s veteran leaders, said Sunday that the incident cast a “dark cloud” over the rest of the season.On Monday, receiver Quincy Enunwa said that the fallout hindered the team’s performance by making players, including himself, think more about individual goals than team goals.“You go into the season and you don’t want to play for self,” Enunwa said. “You want to play for team. But when team doesn’t feel like a team, then you’ve got to start playing for self.”Marshall did not agree that what happened after the Chiefs game had any lingering impact on the team’s performance. He called Richardson “a great talent” who loves football.“It doesn’t come down to one moment,” Marshall said. “It has nothing to do with production. The ball’s thrown to me, I need to catch the ball.”Marshall is one of the most engaging and thoughtful players in the N.F.L., but his outspokenness has occasionally rubbed teammates the wrong way. Enunwa said Marshall sometimes voiced his opinion in a way that some teammates misunderstood.“With Brandon, I know to hear the message, and not the delivery of the message,” Enunwa said. “That’s not easy for everybody.”Marshall has a year remaining on his contract, but the Jets will have to decide if his play is worth $7.5 million. His numbers (59 catches for 788 yards and three touchdowns) this season were much lower than his career averages.As far as his role as a team leader, Marshall said he could have done a better job tailoring the tone of his messages.“In retrospect, there may have been a time or two after games, there’s so much emotion, so if you approach a situation with calmness and a cool head it doesn’t mean the next man will,” Marshall said. “You have to be able to not only understand where you’re at, but also where the next man is at.”He added: “I think in retrospect I could work on my timing. But I’m totally fine with my approach. My only motive is to win games.”Bowles seemed to have no problem with the infighting. He was more concerned that it was picked up by the news media and that it turned into a distraction.“I was on a Super Bowl team, and we argued every day — even after we won games 45-0,” Bowles said. “It’s a matter of squashing it right where it is. That’s a sign of maturity.”Bowles would not comment on his coaching staff, although changes are anticipated there as well. And the quarterback next season will almost certainly not be Fitzpatrick, who signed a one-year deal in July but failed to come anywhere close to repeating the success he had in 2015.Fitzpatrick said he was saying his goodbyes to coaches and staff members, although it was unclear if he meant for the winter or for good. Either way, he and other Jets players were relieved to put this season behind them.“Losing takes its toll,” Fitzpatrick said. “We put so much time and effort each week into the game plan, and so much work in the off-season and all that, it’s tough on everybody when you’re losing.”"
"At Michigan, Duncan Robinson Finds a New Role and a Bigger Stage","ANN ARBOR, Mich. — East Quad at the University of Michigan is a large, newly renovated dormitory with classrooms, a theater, a coffee shop and about 850 students — equal to about 40 percent of the entire enrollment of Williams College in Massachusetts.Duncan Robinson sat in his new East Quad room in August 2014 with his mother, Elisabeth, and his sister, Marta. They had arrived early, a week ahead of the general student population and the basketball team, which was still touring Italy.After a year at cozy Williams, the empty dorm felt cavernous and overwhelming to the Robinson family. Slowly, a pinch of doubt about the bold move that Duncan was attempting bubbled to the surface.“It did not have a college feel to it,” Marta Robinson said of the deserted residence hall. “It was lonely and stark. We were moving him in, and he was very, very quiet. I remember he said, ‘I’m just worried that I made the wrong decision.’”That decision was to leave the cocoon of Williams, a top liberal-arts college tucked away in the Berkshires, and join Michigan, one of the most prominent athletic universities in the world, with a student body more than 20 times larger than that of Williams.Robinson, a lithe shooting guard with a quick release, spent one year at Williams, an N.C.A.A. Division III school, tangling with small private colleges like Colby, Bowdoin and Amherst in front of audiences that sometimes measured fewer than 300 people, and he was not even his team’s top scorer. At Division I Michigan, he would start against national powerhouses like Michigan State and Indiana, watched by 17,000 or 18,000 rowdy fans and large national television audiences.Basketball-wise, it was the rough equivalent of jumping straight from the sixth-grade Christmas pageant to Broadway.“It was definitely a leap of faith,” Robinson said after a recent game at Michigan’s Crisler Arena. “But once the door was open and the opportunity presented itself, I knew I would never be able to forgive myself if I turned it down. I was betting on myself. If I was going to go down, I was going down swinging.”But instead of going down swinging, he has gone up shooting.College basketball players’ transferring between universities was once rare, but now hundreds of players move among Division I programs each year, and even some from Division II up to Division I.Still, according to a survey compiled each year by Jeff Goodman and Jeff Borzello of ESPN, out of about 700 transfers in each of the past two years, only two players went from Division III schools to Division I.“I’ve never seen anyone do what he has done,” Goodman said. “He didn’t just jump to any Division I school. He did it at Michigan, and the incredible thing is he is making an impact there.”After sitting out a year by rule and only practicing, Robinson started 27 of Michigan’s 36 games last season and averaged 11.2 points, showing he could successfully navigate the jump from the quaint New England Small College Athletic Conference to the pressurized Big Ten.His 95 3-pointers last season were the third most in the Big Ten, and he shot 45.0 percent from beyond the 3-point line, the second-highest rate in the conference.Robinson, a senior, has posted slightly lower numbers this year. He is mostly coming off the bench now, and he is averaging 9.3 points per game, while his 3-point rate dipped to 39 percent. But Michigan still has the bulk of its season remaining, having just begun conference play.Robinson still has room for improvement, but whatever doubt he shared with his mother and sister on his first day on campus is long gone.Not that there was ever any doubt that he could shoot. Mike Crotty, Robinson’s Amateur Athletic Union coach with the Middlesex Magic, who was the director of player development for the Boston Celtics when they won the N.B.A. championship in 2008, thinks Robinson can do it at the professional level, too.“He is as good a shooter as there is in the world,” Crotty said. “I was with the Celtics when Ray Allen was there, and I know what the best shooter of all time looks like. Duncan can shoot at that level.”If that happens, it is believed Robinson will be the first player from Williams College to play in the league. There were two players from William & Mary in the N.B.A., and two from William Paterson University. But according to the Basketball Reference website, no one from Williams College has made it.A late bloomer, Robinson was not highly recruited out of high school, and most New England colleges did not show much interest. He spent a postgraduate year at Phillips Exeter Academy, the prestigious prep school in New Hampshire, and in October that year, he committed to Williams to play for Coach Mike Maker.Going to a small college was not an issue. Robinson’s sixth-grade class on the island of New Castle in New Hampshire had four students in it — not even enough to fill a basketball lineup.At Williams, Robinson began to blossom, averaging 17.1 points per game in his freshman season as he helped the Ephs reach the N.C.A.A. Division III title game in Salem, Va.It was the only time the team flew to a game that year.“It was a big deal,” Robinson said. “We were very excited about that. Bus rides were 10, 12 hours. We actually bused to Virginia earlier that year.”Now, he jets to and fro with Michigan. The Wolverines already flew to New York and Los Angeles this year and played on ESPN six times before their winter break. At Williams, the Robinson family had to stream the live conference feed when they could not get to a game.“I would get texts from people I hadn’t heard from since high school,” Marta Robinson said. “And they would be like, ‘Does your brother play for Michigan?’”As appealing as the big spotlight is, Robinson loved Williams, and so did his tightknit family, who never imagined that he would leave. But when Maker decided to take a coaching job at Marist College in June 2014, Robinson began to wonder.The day that news broke, Robinson and his sister were driving south on the Pacific Coast Highway toward the Golden Gate Bridge after visiting their cousins.“My sister was crying and asking what I was going to do,” Robinson recalled. “I said: ‘Marta, this could be a total positive. Who knows? I could end up at a place like Michigan.’ I didn’t know anything. I was just throwing it out there.”But in his mind, Robinson had already formulated a small list of top universities he would consider leaving Williams for, including Michigan, Stanford, Davidson, Duke and Harvard.Michigan, with its high academic and athletic standards, was a good fit, and Robinson had a connection. Maker was an assistant to Wolverines Coach John Beilein when they were at West Virginia from 2005 to 2007. Maker asked his former boss to screen tape of Robinson and perhaps consider him as a walk-on.“I looked at some video of him and I said, ‘This isn’t any walk-on,’” Beilein said. “So we offered him a scholarship.”Two seasons later, Robinson is out of East Quad, living in an Ann Arbor apartment with teammates and hoping to get Michigan back to the Final Four of the N.C.A.A. tournament — Division I, that is.Then, perhaps, another jump all the way to the N.B.A.“There’s areas I need to develop and grow,” he said. “But that’s a dream and an aspiration that I’m going to keep working towards.”"
"In a New Year, Knicks Show the Same Defensive Problems","The Knicks face a problem with no apparent solution. It is as if they are caught in a perpetual loop. After one ugly loss or another in which their defense puts up little resistance, the Knicks begin to ring an alarm and challenge themselves to do better. The words soon ring hollow after another team puts up huge numbers.The Knicks have shown no end to this cycle and to the question it raises: Can their defense be fixed? No, it seems.Two nights after allowing a season-worst 69 points in the first half to James Harden and the Houston Rockets, the Knicks returned home Monday night and allowed 67 points to the Orlando Magic in the first half on their way to a 115-103 loss.It was as if the Knicks had made a new year’s resolution and abandoned it after a day.The Knicks had entered the new year on shaky ground. For the first time in more than a month, they were under .500 again. One of their star players was injured. They had strung together a series of distressing defeats. Coach Jeff Hornacek and forward Carmelo Anthony declared that January was an important month for the team’s standing.Peppered after the game with question after question about the team’s defense, Hornacek appeared as if he might be ready to shake things up a bit.“I don’t think our guys aren’t trying,” he said. “Maybe we’re just not capable of it. That’s what we’re going to have to figure out. Maybe we have to play some of these other guys. We might have to mix the lineup somehow.”The explanation landed with a thud in the locker room. Anthony disagreed but did not want to discuss it in public. Joakim Noah, who led many suffocating defenses during his time with the Chicago Bulls, struggled for an appropriate response. He lowered his head and took time to choose his words.“I don’t know what to say about that,” Noah said. “I know I’m here, and I feel like this group can do a lot better.”Still, with a fifth straight loss, the Knicks are in a slump that could undermine their season. They have admitted as much, and it was clear even before the Magic thumped them.The Knicks are 16-18 and out of a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, which is larded with unspectacular teams. Two months into the season, they are in a precarious position.“We’re in that stretch now where if we can mentally bring it, it’s an important stretch for us,” Hornacek said before the game. “Obviously, we wish we were farther up the ladder, but this month has a lot of teams that are the same as us. So this is going to be a big month for us.”The Knicks’ defense was the sixth worst in the league before lowly Orlando hit 49.5 percent of its shots and scored with ease. The defense has kept the Knicks from rising and demonstrated that although the roster has current and past stars, the whole may not be as good as the sum of the parts.Now, the Knicks must navigate a critical stretch.Hornacek divides the season into thirds. The first 25 games or so are ruled by the passion and intensity of a nascent season. During the middle third, teams must fight through the doldrums, he said. The final part of the season is about positioning and staying relevant, but the Knicks must not falter before then.They will play 17 games this month — 12 of them against conference peers — and with the team’s best players battling ailments. Courtney Lee has been dogged by a balky right wrist, which has forced him out of the lineup. Anthony, who led the Knicks on Monday with 19 points, missed the second half Saturday because of a sore left knee.Kristaps Porzingis missed his second straight game because of a sore left Achilles’ tendon. While he said he thought he could have played, the Knicks held him out as a precaution.“I don’t feel it when I walk anymore,” he said. “It’s just some explosive moments that I do still feel it, and it’s still sensitive. It’s definitely getting better.”If only injuries were the Knicks’ sole problem. They are once again caught in a rut, and this time it has come at a poor moment.“We have to find some way to play some defense,” Hornacek said."
The Three N.B.A. Games to Watch This Week,"It looks like some N.B.A. teams got an early start on their New Year’s resolutions.The Washington Wizards — who less than a month ago looked like one of the worst teams in the league — ended 2016 on a tear. They have won nine of their last 13 games and vaulted into sixth place in the Eastern Conference.While the Wizards rose, lesser climbs were taking place in the West, where the New Orleans Pelicans have won five of their last seven (including victories over the Knicks and the Clippers) and the Sacramento Kings have won four of their last six to leap into eighth place.None of these teams seem bound for the later rounds of the playoffs. (The Utah Jazz, who won seven of their last 10 December games, are an exception.) But with just over a month until the All-Star break, these late-December turning points could end up redefining their seasons: The top eight teams in both conferences on Dec. 31, 2015, composed the entire postseason field last season.If that happens this season, the Wizards and the Kings will have changed their fortunes through their recent play. Maybe by the end of 2017, they will find themselves featuring heavily in a highlight reel like this one:Let’s get into some games.Have a question or a suggestion for this column? Send an email to NBAweek@nytimes.com, or bother me on Twitter: @Jonesieman.Oklahoma City at Houston, Thursday, 8 p.m., TNTThe N.B.A. starts slowly this week, as the league recovers from its biting New Year’s Eve hangover. (Too much of Michael’s Secret Stuff, I guess.)But by Thursday evening, it should be back in fighting shape, as Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder visit James Harden and the Houston Rockets.At one point in the season, the two teams appeared to be mirror images of each other. Oklahoma City lives and dies by Westbrook’s performances, and he has been putting up some of the most impressive stats in N.B.A. history, averaging more than 30 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists a game. His 16 triple-doubles have him on track to pass Larry Bird as one of the five most prolific triple-doublers in league history, joining the illustrious company of Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, Jason Kidd and Wilt Chamberlain.Harden is also having an extraordinary season: His eight triple-doubles are second to Westbrook’s, and as of Sunday, he actually had more double-doubles than Westbrook. But it is not as if the Rockets are superior to the Thunder simply because Harden is subtly winning the superstar matchup. Houston has more talent.Clint Capela, the Rockets’ 6-foot-10 third-year center, has steadily become more reliable. He is averaging close to 12 points and eight rebounds, and his scoring has made it more difficult for teams to leave the paint and close out on the Rockets’ 3-point shooters.Houston scores a greater percentage of its points from the 3-point line than any other team, which Capela helps make possible. But to be a great 3-point team, great shooters are also necessary. In his first season in Houston, guard Eric Gordon has proven crucial. Averaging more than 17 points a game, he is taking more 3s than he ever has, and his new team is benefiting.The Thunder are a significantly better defensive team than the Rockets. But Westbrook carries too much of the load on offense to make Oklahoma City a contender. He has been productive enough to keep the Thunder afloat, and there is nothing that suggests he will not be able to drive them into the playoffs.But once there, Oklahoma City will meet teams like Houston, whose skill across the court should spell doom for any one-man band, no matter how talented that man is.Knicks at Milwaukee, Friday, 8 p.m.The Knicks are barely hanging on. After looking great through the first half of December, they are in 10th place in the East after having lost eightof their last 10. After missing the postseason last year, Milwaukee is in sixth place and looks poised to return in 2017.Utah at Memphis, Sunday, 8 p.m., NBATVThe Jazz are no joke. Their offense is rated in the top 10, and their defense in the top two, per NBA.com. Gordon Hayward is a legitimate all-star, George Hill is having the season of his career and Rudy Gobert is one of the most entertaining players in the N.B.A. Memphis is able to beat any team on any night, but Utah will pose quite a challenge.How have the Wizards improved so fast?Let’s start with their best player. John Wall, Washington’s All-Star point guard, has gone into overdrive. In December, he averaged 24.5 points per game to go along with 10.7 assists and 2.7 steals, according to ESPN.Wall, the team’s leading assist man, is the key to the success of the other Wizards. His leap from nine assists a game to 10.7 coincides with a teamwide boost, from 20.9 a game in November to 24.2 in December, per NBA.com. And because Washington is passing better, it is having a far easier time scoring: The Wizards averaged almost 6 more points a game in December than in the previous month.Wall’s leadership has coincided with improvements across the board for Otto Porter Jr., now in his fourth season, as well as the new acquisition Trey Burke, whose contributions had been quiet until he broke out for 27 points against the Nets on Friday. (Burke could become an important asset for Washington, which desperately needs some scoring off the bench.)Given their improvements, you would think that the Wizards would have been involved in one of the games of the week. But Washington is rarely on national television, something that irks Wall to no end.“If you don’t have League Pass or NBA TV, you don’t see the Wizards,” he told Candace Buckner of The Washington Post last week.That has been true. But if he keeps leading his team as he has been, N.B.A. fans are going to have no choice but to see Wall and company when they make it to the postseason.That is all for now. See you all next week."
The Rangers and the Knicks Get a New Sound for the Winter Seasons,"Ray Castoldi’s 27th season as the organist for the Knicks and 25th for the Rangers has already been like no other, largely because of the handsome Roland AT-900 organ that now hunches in a tiny booth five stories above the arena floor at Madison Square Garden.Compared to a mere keyboard, which Castoldi had played at the Garden since 1989, the Roland, known generically as a theater organ, is a step up in class as well as a step back in time, to when ballparks and arenas were fitted with booming organs that provided warmer, richer, deeper sounds to sporting events.“To a lot of people, it feels like sports,” Castoldi said as he sat at the organ two hours before a recent Rangers game.Castoldi, 53, a classically trained musician with horn-rimmed glasses and a shaggy mane of dark hair, is the music director at the Garden, which means he also handles recorded music at Knicks and Rangers games. He wrote one of the N.H.L.’s most famous goal songs, “Slapshot,” which debuted in 1995 and is played after the Rangers score at home, with fans heartily singing along.Castoldi bent to the trend of playing more recorded music during sporting events, but he grew up in New York idolizing organists like Jane Jarvis at Shea Stadium and Eddie Layton, known as Limo, at Yankee Stadium. Gladys Goodding not only played at the old Garden on Eighth Avenue but also at Brooklyn Dodgers games at Ebbets Field.“There’s an organ tradition here in New York,” Castoldi said. “It’s one of the places where it started in the days before you had recorded music available.”Castoldi’s boss, Marc Bauman, the senior vice president who produces in-game entertainment at the Garden, had a chance to buy a floor model Roland from a dealer on Long Island. Although it is a digital organ that can produce many types of sounds, the Roland can, perhaps best of all, reproduce the thunderous, pipe-organ sound of a Wurlitzer.That was the sound of sports in a smoky old arena — now the Garden has it, without the smoke.“People absolutely connect to it,” Bauman said. “This brings us back from all the popular stuff you listen to everywhere else you go. Once you hear this is a much richer tapestry of sound, people say, ‘Oh, I get it.’ A large part of the audience at games are adults, and the moms and dads heard this sound when they are kids.”Castoldi is happy to report that the number of arenas with live organists is growing, to 22 at his last count. Four N.H.L. arenas now use theater organs, including the United Center in Chicago; the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul; and Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla., where the 24-year-old Lightning installed a pipe organ in 2010 for a more authentic hockey experience.“There’s like a revival going on,” Castoldi said.Castoldi does not play at every Knicks and Rangers home game, but, with the new organ in place, he has found himself playing at more games so far this season. He is also playing the new organ more often than he played the old keyboard, because, as Bauman said, it offers more bells and whistles.“I’m playing better,” Castoldi said, smiling. “There’s more variety, just more fleshing out the songs.”Seven minutes before the Rangers took the ice for a pregame warm-up against the Chicago Blackhawks last month, well before most of the crowd arrived, Castoldi got on the Roland and played “Christmas Time Is Here” and “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,” layering in the sound of bells to the tunes.The Rangers came out to the sound of recorded, pulsating music, but when they retreated to their dressing room to prepare for the game, Castoldi got back on the organ and played “New York, New York,” which Layton, who died in 2004, loved to play on the Hammond organ at Yankee Stadium.“I spent a lot of time at the Stadium stealing everything I could from the guy,” Castoldi said of Layton.Castoldi roused the fans by playing the “Let’s Go, Rangers!” chant midway through a scoreless first period, then saluted the musician Greg Lake, who died last month, by playing “Karn Evil 9,” by the band Emerson, Lake and Palmer, during the first-period intermission.After the Mets pitchers Noah Syndergaard and Matt Harvey, sitting in seats close to the ice, were shown on the big screen, Castoldi serenaded them with “Take Me Out to the Ballgame.” He also played ominously after the Blackhawks scored the first goal of the game, and fans joined in the refrain when Castoldi played “Tequila” between the second and third periods.Castoldi played “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town” again when the Rangers played the Devils a few days later, but added a twist for longtime Rangers fans between the first and second verses. He played the musical introduction for the famous chant that ends with the salty taunt of the former Islanders defenseman Denis Potvin. Many fans joined in, merrily.Castoldi said the pace of hockey games offered more chances to play than basketball games. And organ music seems to be tied more closely to hockey than basketball.The new organ has also generated interest from New York musicians who want to accompany Castoldi on their instruments at games. Shawn Pelton, the longtime drummer in the “Saturday Night Live” band on NBC, has supplied drum tracks to add punch to the sound of the organ.“You can tell in a second when something is canned,” Castoldi said.Castoldi has taken on bigger challenges. When the Garden played host to the Republican National Convention in 2004, six Liberty games were played at Radio City Music Hall, with its 4,410-pipe Mighty Wurlitzer.Castoldi described the experience as “like an awakening. I played the organ, and the organ won.”But now he has a manageable new friend in the Roland AT-900.“This is something I’ve always wanted,” he said, adding, “For me, it’s like the whole thing has come full circle.”"
"Nick Symmonds, a Polarizing Force in Track and Field, Announces Retirement Plans","Nick Symmonds has always considered himself a businessman first and an 800-meter runner second.“I’ve never really considered myself a runner,” he said. “Running was a business of mine” and “a great way for me to market products.”In a recent interview, Symmonds, 33, announced that he would retire from the track after the 2017 outdoor season. He will leave the sport as a two-time Olympian, a six-time United States outdoor champion at 800 meters and a silver medalist at the 2013 world championships in Moscow.He will also leave as perhaps the most outspoken, polarizing and essential American track and field athlete of the past decade. As a runner, his preferred style was to sit and kick. As an activist for athletes’ marketing rights, as well as an advocate for gay rights and gun control, he operated from the front, a loud, bold provocateur.His greatest compliment probably came from the sportswriter who once called him “Team USA’s official pain in the butt.”He railed against the marketing limits of a sport dominated and restricted by shoe companies, particularly Nike. He auctioned his shoulder as advertising space, a human billboard. He refused to sign a document that seemed to force American athletes to wear Nike gear even when brushing their teeth at the 2015 world championships in Beijing, sacrificing a spot on the team.Last January, a caffeinated gum company co-owned by Symmonds sued the United States Olympic Committee and USA Track & Field, accusing them of violating antitrust laws. What Symmonds sought was permission for athletes to wear logos beyond those of shoe and apparel companies on their uniforms at the 2016 Olympic trials.The suit was dismissed in federal court. Symmonds has appealed. His argument is this: If athletes are limited to wearing designated shoe company logos at track and field’s premier events, the Olympic trials and the Summer Games, why would other companies invest in a sport that struggles for visibility and credibility?“Once athletes make it to center stage, their rights are tread upon,” Symmonds said. “They can’t even mention the sponsors that got them there. It’s just a horrible place to invest money.”Perhaps no sport can match track and field’s elemental appeal. But it is also a sport ravaged by doping and hampered by a dysfunctional transition over the last three decades from amateur to professional. The top stars earn a comfortable living while many others struggle to make more than $10,000 or $15,000 a year.Symmonds has one provocative solution: for the International Olympic Committee to share 50 percent of its $4 billion-plus in quadrennial revenue with the approximately 14,400 winter and summer Olympic athletes who compete in each four-year cycle.This 50/50 sharing approximates a standard business model in American professional sports. It would amount to about $140,000 per Olympian. Currently, athletes receive nothing from the I.O.C. for participating in the Olympics.Because of the national pride involved, Symmonds said: “It’s pretty brilliant what they’ve done. They’ve created this thing where people will work for free just for the honor of it.”Meanwhile, he said, Olympic officials live privileged lives “on the hard work and labor of the athletes, and that’s just ridiculous.”But Symmonds also knows that until athletes act collectively, little is expected to change. Forming an international union seems highly unlikely. Track and field athletes are individual contractors, not teammates. Athletes in each event have their own concerns. Building a consensus is complicated by a diversity of languages, interests and national politics.“I guess I feel kind of inadequate, in the sense that we never really accomplished all the things I wanted to accomplish,” Symmonds said. “We made a few dents here and there, but the big changes never came about.“I just see track and field continuing to be a semiprofessional sport,” he said. “It makes me a little sad to see everybody fighting for scraps when we have such an incredible product that is just not marketed right and not governed right.”Yet, Symmonds can claim success in forcing athletes to look beyond mere competition, said Adam Nelson of the United States, the 2004 Olympic shot-put champion and president of the Track and Field Athletes Association, an advocacy group.“In the last decade, Nick had a big influence on what athletes believe they own and what rights they are entitled to,” Nelson said.Symmonds also faced his share of criticism, accused of posturing and self-promotion. His biggest weakness was probably also his biggest strength, a willingness to speak his mind and stand alone for what he believed, Nelson said.“It would have been great if he had found more ways to involve more athletes,” Nelson said. But, he added: “There is nothing in this world that ever gets done when you don’t align self-interest with the ultimate cause. I wish there were more athletes that had the courage to take stronger stands on issues like Nick did.”Even though Symmonds is retiring from the track, he is leaving the door open for other athletic pursuits. He would like to run a marathon, with a goal of breaking three hours. And he would like to climb the world’s highest peaks, including Mount Everest.“I think only about 10 percent of humans are physiologically able to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen, and I’m really curious to see if I am one of them,” he said.An ascent of Everest, Symmonds said, would make him the first person to have climbed the world’s tallest mountain and to have run a sub-four-minute mile.“No one’s ever done both,” he said. “That’s a daydream.”Told this, Nelson chuckled over the phone.“He’s always been someone who’s dared to dream big,” Nelson said, “and that’s a big part of why he’s been successful.”"
Jets Part Ways With Six Assistant Coaches,"Coach Todd Bowles began meting out the consequences for the Jets’ dreadful 5-11 season, firing five of his assistant coaches on Tuesday. A sixth, the offensive coordinator Chan Gailey, also will not return, saying in a statement that he told Bowles before the season that he would retire afterward.Gailey oversaw a unit undermined by poor quarterback play — the Jets’ 25 interceptions led the N.F.L. — and the absence of receiver Eric Decker, who missed the final 13 games with a torn rotator cuff. The Jets’ quarterback misery also prompted Bowles to fire the coach for that position, Kevin Patullo.Their replacements will be critical hires for Bowles, whose starting quarterback for next season, in all likelihood, is not on the current roster. The Jets are almost certain to find an experienced quarterback to give the recent draft picks Bryce Petty and Christian Hackenberg more time to develop.Also gone are the running backs coach Marcel Shipp and three defensive coaches: Mark Collins (outside linebackers), Joe Danna (defensive backs) and Pepper Johnson (defensive line), who won two Super Bowls as a linebacker for the Giants and three as an assistant coach in New England."
"Serena Williams, Rusty but Rested, Returns From a 4-Month Break","AUCKLAND, New Zealand — Half a world and four months removed from her last match, Serena Williams slowly but surely settled in as she faced her first test of the season.After hitting several wrong notes, Williams tuned her game to orchestrate a 6-3, 6-4 victory over 69th-ranked Pauline Parmentier of France on Tuesday in the first round of the ASB Classic, a WTA tournament that serves as a warm-up for the Australian Open this month.“I definitely felt that rust, but I felt like, mentally, I knew how to get it back and I knew how to get in there,” she said. “That felt really good.”Williams, 35, was playing her first match since a loss to Karolina Pliskova in the United States Open semifinals in September, having skipped the tour’s fall circuit for a second consecutive year. She had played the most selective schedule of her career — only eight tournaments in 2016 — and her sporadic play had allowed Angelique Kerber to end Williams’s three-and-a-half year reign atop the world rankings. Williams is now ranked second.Despite the costs, Williams said, the time away from her racket was necessary, restful and restorative.“Last year, I didn’t play in the fall, but I worked probably more than I ever have — and it was too much, in fact,” she said, referring to late 2015. “This year, I didn’t play, and I actually took time off from everything. I really think it made a world of difference. I just feel a little bit more refreshed than I did last year. I just learned from that mistake. I was like, ‘Serena, you’re going to take some days off and just not do anything.’ I think that was the best thing I could have done.”She added: “I just felt like I’ve been on the top for so long, so many years. After a while, you kind of need to take a step back and enjoy moments and then recharge — mentally, more than anything.”When Williams began her off-season training in earnest, she did so with a determination that impressed her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou.“You know how it is: You can wake up one day, and the motivation is not there anymore,” he said. “So she showed to herself and to everyone in the team that she was still motivated, which was very good news.”Williams and Mouratoglou decided to focus on improving in specific areas — neither would disclose them — to keep her game from stagnating.“I don’t want to come out here and have the same game,” Williams said. “I want to have some improvement.”Mouratoglou, who described Williams as “incredibly complex” and “always changing” off the court, credited her with being able to evolve on the court amid the game’s shifts across her career.“If you look at her game throughout the years, she’s adapted to so many different kinds of tennis, different players, and was able to win for such a long period because her game changed,” he said. “She does things that surprise me, even on the court sometimes. It’s great because otherwise, when you know the player perfectly and in every situation you know what’s going to happen, it can be boring. But with her, never.”One recent change in Williams’s life that surprised some was the announcement of her engagement to Alexis Ohanian, a founder of Reddit. Mouratoglou said the positive developments in Williams’s personal life would only prove beneficial on the court.“I think players need stability because everything is changing every day: countries, surface, opponents, conditions, everything,” he said. “It’s difficult, and when you have a lot of stability, you feel better. I’m happy for her because I feel that she’s happy. That’s what’s most important. And if she’s happy, there’s no reason why it wouldn’t positively affect her tennis.”Williams said she hoped it would, too.“It definitely should,” she said, laughing. “We’ll see how that plays out.”Without playing, Williams drew attention with an impassioned social media post about police violence in September, and she was also the focus of an hourlong interview special on ESPN in December.Mouratoglou said he relished the attention and the pressure that accompany working with a player of Williams’s caliber.“Being with Serena, you cannot do better,” he said. “If it was easy, everyone would do it, but it’s a tough job.”He then considered the alternative.“It’s tough also to coach players who lose every week,” he said, laughing. “Maybe tougher — and that’s the case for most of them.”For Williams, the expectation of excellence can also be a burden.“The expectation is incredible, and there are very few people, if any in sport, who go with that on a daily, daily basis,” she said. “It’s something that I feel like I’m dealing with better, in particular in the past few months, and I hope to be able to deal with it better this year.”Williams has often balked at questions about further records she might break — on top of her 22 Grand Slam singles titles, which have her tied with Steffi Graf for the most in the Open era — but she laughed ruefully in confirming that her lofty standards had not changed.“Well, you know what a successful 2017 for me is,” she said. “Unfortunately, I have the highest of goals usually, so obviously that involves winning Grand Slams. And that’s all. That’s basically what I want to do.“But you have to win tournaments like this, or do well in tournaments like this, in order to do well in Grand Slams,” she said of being in Auckland. “So these events really, really count.”Williams’s schedule last year included only the four Grand Slam events, the Olympics and three of the largest WTA events: the prominent American tournaments in Indian Wells, Calif., and Key Biscayne, Fla., and the Italian Open in Rome.Her appearance this week in Auckland for a far-flung tournament on the lowest tier of the WTA Tour — an event she had never played in before — has surprised and delighted locals. As she walked on the court Tuesday, the tournament’s announcer exhorted fans to rise for the “royalty in the house,” and they obliged.“You would never think in this point in my career that I would still go places I’ve never been,” Williams said.With the opportunity to make further history in the sport this year, Williams may reach more uncharted territory soon."
"Jean Vuarnet, a Downhill Skiing Innovator, Dies at 83","Jean Vuarnet, a Frenchman who won the gold medal in downhill skiing at the 1960 Winter Olympics using an innovative approach to aerodynamics and decades later endured the deaths of his wife and his youngest son in a doomsday cult’s murder-suicide ritual, died on Monday in Sallanches, France. He was 83.The cause was a stroke, the French National Olympic and Sports Committee announced.Vuarnet was 27 when he arrived in Squaw Valley, Calif., for the 1960 Games. He was not France’s best hope for a medal, but he was a student of skiing technique and had helped write several books on the subject. In search of extra speed, he raced the 10,154-foot course in an unprecedented way — with his knees bent in a tuck position to reduce the drag on his body from the wind.The tuck requires skiers to squat, with their backs parallel to the slope and their rear ends raised slightly above their heads.The position, which came to be known as l’oeuf (“the egg”), appeared to be revolutionary, but to some, it was more of a variation on earlier racing positions.“The tuck seems so obvious and self-evident that we forget someone had to invent it,” Steve Porino, a former downhill racer for the United States team, said in an interview. “You cannot survive without a tuck in ski racing.”Porino, now an NBC skiing analyst, added, “What the hell were we doing skiing in the upright position?”Vuarnet’s race at Squaw Valley was unusual for a second reason: He won on metal skis — not traditional wooden ones — which were delivered to him only days before he raced.In an account of the race he gave decades later to Le Figaro, a French newspaper, Vuarnet said: “I’d only gone 60 meters when I made a mistake. I was going too fast and missed my mark. I said to myself, ‘I’m lost.’”He was greeted at the end by silence from the crowd and from the loudspeaker, which was not working. “The scoreboard was frozen,” he added; the No. 7 of his rival Hans-Peter Lanig of Germany was at the top. Finally, after a lengthy wait, Vuarnet’s No. 10 appeared in first.In 2010, on the 50th anniversary of his gold-medal-winning race, a glass statue of Vuarnet, tightly tucked in his racing form, was unveiled in the Alpine town of Morzine, France, where he grew up.Jean Raoul Célina André Vuarnet was born on Jan. 18, 1933, in Le Bardo, Tunisia, but his family moved the next year to Morzine. Little information was immediately available about his mother or his father, Victor, other than that he was a doctor.Jean Vuarnet went to law school at the University of Grenoble in France, in part because of its proximity to skiing. It could not be determined if he had graduated before pursuing his amateur skiing career.After winning at Squaw Valley, Vuarnet licensed his name to a popular brand of high-end anti-glare sunglasses. He became the head of Morzine’s office of tourism and helped to develop the Avoriaz ski resort in Morzine.In 1995, his wife, the former Edith Bonlieu, who competed in the downhill at the 1956 Winter Olympics, and their son Patrick were among the 16 people whose charred bodies were laid out in a star formation around the remains of a campfire in the Vercors region of southeastern France.Each had at least one bullet wound and had been doused with incendiary fluids. All were members of a cult called the Order of the Solar Temple. A year earlier, 53 of its members had died in Switzerland and Canada in what appeared to be elaborately planned deaths.Vuarnet had two other sons, Pierre and Alain. Information about survivors was not immediately available."
Knicks’ Coaches Scramble to Fix the Defense Before It’s Too Late,"GREENBURGH, N.Y. — After the Knicks finished practice Tuesday afternoon and most of the players had walked into their locker room, the coaches remained on the court.Faced with the arduous task of rehabilitating the Knicks’ defense, Jeff Hornacek and his staff huddled near the foul line and evaluated their options. They ran pick-and-rolls, talking after each one. Presumably, they were trying to figure out the best way for the Knicks to defend that most common of N.B.A. plays.So far this season, the Knicks have not. Nor have they been very successful at dealing with other offensive schemes thrown at them. It should be no surprise that only the Nets, who are 8-25, had allowed more points per game in the Eastern Conference than the Knicks entering Tuesday and that just five N.B.A. teams had a worse defensive rating.Monday’s loss at home to the Orlando Magic — who scored 115 points, to the Knicks’ 103 — highlighted the continuing problem, which could crater what at times has seemed to be a promising season.So the emphasis Tuesday was on fixing what is wrong before it is too late, with the Knicks’ next game set for Wednesday, at home against the Milwaukee Bucks. The Knicks have fallen to 16-18 by losing five games in a row, and while injuries to Kristaps Porzingis, Courtney Lee and Carmelo Anthony have been a factor, the defense is the game-to-game culprit.Tuesday was a start in the right direction, Porzingis said, although he sat out practice as he continued to deal with a sore right Achilles’ tendon.“Today we had the type of fight that we need to have,” he said. “All practice we had it. I’m sure tomorrow we’ll come out in a different mentality and a different effort.”Hornacek said the Knicks had used the practice to watch film and to smooth out concerns and questions they had about their defensive strategies. He also clarified the comments he had made the night before, when he wondered aloud, in the wake of the loss to Orlando, if the Knicks just did not have the talent necessary for playing solid defense.On Tuesday, Hornacek put the onus back on the Knicks’ coaches. He said it was up to the staff to use players in optimal ways on defense.Inevitably, though, this latest discussion of the Knicks’ problems on defense turned to the fundamental question of effort. Good defense requires a lot of it, regardless of a player’s skill level, and the Knicks have allowed the notion to arise that whatever other problems they have on defense, they simply do not play hard enough when the other team has the ball.“When we say the effort, it’s different levels of effort,” Hornacek said. “Like I said last night, I think the guys really are trying, but defense is tough. It’s an all-out, running into guys, hustling, not stopping — it’s a lot harder than offense. So the effort they are giving, I think, is good, but we got to get it to be great.”The Knicks, by quantitative measures, have been mostly average when it comes to effort. Although they drew the third-fewest charges on defense, and deflected the eighth-fewest passes, they ranked 14th in the league in contested shots per game and 15th in contested 3-pointers, according to NBA.com.Those last two statistics have a lot to do with Porzingis, whose 1.94 blocks per game was the league’s sixth-best mark going into Tuesday’s games; the number of shots he had contested was the league’s second-highest. Unfortunately for the Knicks, Porzingis is likely to miss a third straight game on Wednesday.So Hornacek will have to continue tinkering with his lineup as he tries to seal all the leaks on defense.Although Kurt Rambis, named the team’s defensive coordinator in early November, has not been able to fix the problem, Hornacek said he was not looking to remove Rambis from that role. Nor is he trying to mix up the starting lineup in an effort to improve the results on defense, although that is something he is always monitoring, he said.“You just got to help each other out,” Hornacek said. “You got to talk. Stuff that we’ve done in this last month, it’ll work fine. We just got to keep going over it and continue to reiterate what we want them to do. Even if you do it wrong, if you have the effort — not what you think is an effort; what the coaches think is an effort — you can fix a lot of things.”"
"At Chelsea, Antonio Conte’s Personal Touch Proves a Winning One","Everyone at Chelsea agrees on the who. The players, the coaches and the platoon of staff members behind the scenes all say that, in six months as manager, Antonio Conte has transformed the club. He has given a team that seemed to have lost its shine the veneer of a champion.Nobody has any doubt about that. After all, the evidence is overwhelming: Chelsea, only months removed from a season in which José Mourinho’s second coming came crashing to a screeching halt, is purring again. Conte’s team sits 5 points clear at the top of the Premier League. Beat Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and not only will that lead stretch to 8, but a record will be claimed, too: It would be Chelsea’s 14th consecutive win, the best single-season run in the history of the Premier League.Nobody has any doubt that Conte is responsible. What they cannot quite agree on is how.There are as many different explanations as there are players on his squad and staff members at his disposal. Defender Gary Cahill stresses the tactical shift, the switch from a four-man back line to a 3-4-3 formation. Striker Diego Costa, revitalized and repurposed up front, pinpoints Conte’s more human touch. “Every time, he is making more jokes with the players,” Costa said.Pedro, a winger, believes the answer is simpler still. “He put trust and belief in all of the players, and we started winning matches,” he said. “Quite easily, he just turned things around.”None of those accounts are wholly satisfactory, of course; none offer a full picture of Chelsea’s eye-catching reversal. But neither are any of them wrong. Conte has turned around Chelsea not with one grand gesture but with countless small ones. Only Pedro erred slightly: Whatever Conte has done, it most certainly has not been easy.Conte’s work as Chelsea’s manager started long before his first day in the job. In April, after he had accepted the Chelsea job but while he was still preparing Italy for the summer’s European Championship, he made a number of brief visits to London on his days off.He visited Cobham — Chelsea’s training center, in a well-heeled, cosseted corner of Surrey — to speak with players, asking them if they wanted to remain at the club and detailing his plans for the season ahead. But he also sought advice from members of London’s Italian soccer community. He met a handful of his countrymen — agents, coaches, scouts — for coffee or lunch, picking their brains on his new team and his new league, often making notes at the table.When he eventually did take charge, after Italy’s exit in the quarterfinals of the Euros in France, the personal meetings continued. He spoke with, among others, Costa, goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and midfielder Eden Hazard, who was subdued by injury and constricted by defensive duties under Mourinho. Conte not only offered the platitude that he wanted them to stay but also informed them that, no matter what they felt they needed to improve — extra training sessions, more analysis — he and his team would be there to provide it. He promised that he or one of his assistants would be present at Cobham at any hour of the day to help them. His office door remains open to any player who feels he needs an individual meeting.That personal touch is critical to Conte’s managerial style. He makes no secret that he is a family man: In his autobiography, “Testa, Cuore e Gambe” — “Head, Heart and Legs” — he devotes touching, emotional chapters to his wife, Elisabetta, and his daughter, Vittoria. Both will move to London early this year, joining Conte at the apartment Elisabetta picked out in Chelsea Harbour, close to the Italian school they chose for Vittoria.Even now, with both in Italy, he speaks to Vittoria every night before games and talks to both on FaceTime on the team bus, cooing with affection. Family, Conte has always made clear, comes first.He has always tried to inculcate that same sense of loyalty in his professional life. Since his arrival at Chelsea, Conte has assiduously tried to turn away from the hierarchical model of his predecessor, Mourinho, and forge a more familial atmosphere. That, too, has not been easy.When midfielder Willian lost his mother this season, Conte allowed him as much leave as he felt he needed and made plain that the other players were feeling their teammate’s pain. “We are all supporting him,” Conte said.He has instituted a supper club, encouraging the players and the coaches to go out for dinner together when their schedules permit. He is adamant, though, that the sense of unity has to be felt throughout the whole club.Once, when he managed Juventus, Conte brought his players together to thank the groundskeepers for maintaining the club’s fields through a harsh winter. At Chelsea, he has gone out of his way to make everyone feel part of the team’s success. He bought everyone at the club a bottle of wine for Christmas, the gifts appearing on desks one morning with a personalized note from Conte, and he spent hours exchanging small talk and signing autographs at the staff Christmas party. He even attended a party for the players’ children at a trampolining center just to meet their families.The players have welcomed his affection, but his kindness is not without purpose. “I ask a lot,” Conte once wrote of his management style. “So I know when to say thank you.”His players, certainly, did not find the transition to his methods easy. There was the day, during a preseason training camp in Austria, when they walked into the room for lunch to find nuts, sliced fruit and seeds in place of the selection of chicken, salad, pizza and sandwiches they were expecting. Many assumed they were in the wrong place.Training, too, took some getting used to. Conte’s sessions can be long and arduous, concentrating on shape and movement. “As a player, when I got the ball, I did not know what to do,” Conte said in 2014. “I was not Zidane or Del Piero. I stopped, looked around. I want to give people who, like me, are not as good technically the ability to store solutions.”That involves a focus on shadow play, games of 11 against none that Conte regularly stops to issue instructions or even to manhandle players into the right position. The idea is that the players should memorize as many maneuvers as possible, to cut down on thinking time. In the early days, though, the players found the exercise stifling, repetitive. Only when Conte switched to his 3-4-3, and his squad saw the benefit, did the low-level murmuring stop.Conte’s voice easily filled the gaps: He talks incessantly, so much during practice that Hazard, for one, has admitted that he occasionally switches positions just to have a break from the flood of instructions coming his way. But the talking continues in the dressing room before games as Conte takes players aside, offering hints and tips right until the moment the players line up in the tunnel.Conte never stops cajoling, correcting, castigating. He demands as much from his players as he gives himself, and that, as he has said, is “everything I have.” That combination has transformed Chelsea into something completely different: a sleek, focused unit, rather than the disparate individuals they appeared to have been last year.It may bring them a record at Tottenham and a title at the season’s close. It has not, though, been easy."
Keep Your Eye on the Balls to Become a Better Athlete,"MONTREAL — The acid-yellow spheres on the screen don’t look anything like the linebackers that the Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan tries to avoid each week. Nor do they resemble an English Premier League soccer player streaking down the field, or a puck hurtling across the ice in a National Hockey League game. If anything, they look like finely sheared tennis balls.The beauty in the design of NeuroTracker — the video game aimed at heightening cognitive agility the way lifting dumbbells develops muscles — is allegedly its simplicity. Just by asking the eyes to track spheres as they bound around a 3D screen, athletes can prepare their brains to perform in a way that no other film room could replicate.At least, that was Jocelyn Faubert’s goal when he created NeuroTracker out of his optometry research laboratory at the University of Montreal in 2009. He made it in the mold of Lumosity, a wildly successful brain-gaming app. Instead of targeting baby boomers, however, Faubert designed NeuroTracker for the sports arena.Faubert calls these underappreciated cognitive skills the “gymnastics of the brain.” But until NeuroTracker, there had been little evidence of a good way to isolate and enhance those skills away from the practice field.“It forces you to use certain networks — attention-based networks, memory networks, motion-processing networks,” Faubert said of NeuroTracker. “All of this simultaneous demand — that’s what you do in real life.”Critics, however, call the program digital snake oil. They believe that sports teams, desperate to gain any edge, might be buying into a gimmick.“I have to be extremely skeptical of any training program that promotes the development of these generic visual, perceptual, cognitive functions,” said A. Mark Williams, chairman of the department of health, kinesiology and recreation at the University of Utah.Still, the program has spread to more than 550 elite training facilities around the globe, representing a vast and diverse sporting landscape. Ryan, who is second in the N.F.L. in passing yards and touchdowns this season, said he trained with NeuroTracker at least three times a week.“I use it all year-round,” said Ryan, a top contender for the N.F.L.’s most valuable player award this season.Manchester United quietly spent $80,000 to install a NeuroTracker setup in its facility. U.S. Soccer has tested more than 7,000 youth players on it since 2014. The same program is used by hockey teams including the Vancouver Canucks, and by the IMG Academy, where football prospects train before the N.F.L. draft.Athletes can play it while dribbling a basketball or standing on a balance board. Scores can be posted, promoting competition. There is nothing invasive or messy. With a pair of 3D glasses, players can practice anywhere: in the locker room, at home, in the car.“We set ours up right next to the training room,” said Leonard Zaichkowsky, the former director of sports science for the Canucks. “Guys would try and sneak in and practice.”As teams and players began to rouse to its potential, NeuroTracker’s applications seemed to stretch as far as the imagination could take them. Not only could it be a training tool for athletes in such disparate sports as taekwondo, speedskating and rugby, it was a concussion assessment device; a means to stem the effects of aging; an aid to children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; a rehabilitation exercise for stroke patients. Independent studies piled on the claims. One found that NeuroTracker could be advantageous to doctors performing laparoscopic surgery.NeuroTracker’s parent company, CogniSens, also just started selling a cloud-based, slightly different version of the program, called NuTrain, to regular consumers for $229 a year.“It’s kind of crazy,” Faubert said. “We were addressing questions, asking certain things. And now it’s all over the world.”But as it grew into a sort of performance panacea, the number of skeptics has grown, too, including those who point out that a carefully executed placebo might produce the same resounding reviews — only to suffer when the effect ultimately wears off.The critics contend that it is the game’s simplicity that allows users to perceive results that might not always be there, filling the void the way a minimalist painting can inspire deep introspection.They point to the fallibility of a simulation that boasts extraordinary benefits for elite quarterbacks, soccer midfielders and hockey goalies, players in distinct and unrelated sports. The incredulity is tied to the fissures in the foundation of the brain-gaming industry, which has faced mounting scrutiny about what many believe to be dubious claims, scant scientific evidence and deceptive marketing.In seven years of expansion, NeuroTracker has grown into the most successful brain-training game in sports. But the fundamental question remains as present as ever: Does it really work?One afternoon in October, Faubert pointed out the small room near his office that held the original NeuroTracker: a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment, known simply as the Cave. It was aptly named — the room was cool and dark, except for the lambent glow from a 9-foot by 9-foot projector screen at the distant end of a shadowy three-walled cubicle.Faubert, who is 57 and bald, with dark, prominent eyebrows and white hair buzzed tightly at the sides, is an evergreen optimist with charismatic energy. His ability to distill expansive concepts into digestible bites is somewhat uncommon in neuroscience circles. So is his attire: bluejeans, suede jacket, thick leather boots.His approach to answering complex questions about the human brain’s unique ability to handle a jumble of stimuli enveloping the senses was also uncommon. In 2001, as a researcher studying the neuroscience of vision, he spent $800,000 building the Cave into an immersive, sense-engrossing environment for analyzing real behavior, incorporating gigantic projection systems and mirrors. Participants could move around, spend time, feel as if they are elsewhere — rudimentary virtual reality.Faubert’s initial investigations involved questions related to peripheral vision, posture or balance. But he added spinoff programs, including a simple exercise featuring eight yellow spheres that was rooted in the multiple-object tracking experiments of the psychologists Zenon W. Pylyshyn and Ron W. Storm in the 1980s. With a few tweaks, and 3D glasses, Faubert thought the program might have some other scientific uses.Motivated partly by his own curiosity, Faubert started asking athletes to visit the lab to try tracking the spheres. Among the earliest participants were Jennifer Heil, an Olympic skier, and Jean Pascal, a boxer. It turned out they were remarkably adept at following multiple objects at once.When Faubert started seeing how quickly they improved at the game, he grew more intrigued. “That’s really the signature for me,” Faubert said. “It’s not so much where they start, it’s where they go.”Eight numbered spheres bounce randomly around a cube, which the player sees through 3D glasses. At the outset, four of the spheres will glow red, indicating that those are the spheres to keep an eye on. But they will be red for only a second. Momentarily they turn yellow again, only to fall in with the other foils, all of them dispersing and colliding, like billiard balls sent scattering across a table.After eight seconds, a prompt asks you to recall the numbers of the spheres that had once been red. It is no more intricate than a three-card shuffle performed on a street corner. But the task of following four fast-moving objects simultaneously is a remarkably rigorous test, challenging visual and perceptual capabilities, and such cognitive systems as spatial awareness, concentration and working memory.Faubert increases the speed incrementally, intensifying how quickly the balls bounce, thus making them harder and more deceptive to follow. He has turned his program into a game: For each correct response, you can advance a level, intensifying the speed. When you respond incorrectly, you are demoted a level: The speed decelerates. At the end of an eight-minute trial, you are given a total score.Jean Castonguay, a corporate lawyer with a background in managing start-ups, caught wind of it and saw a business opportunity. He offered to move the program out of the laboratory and into the marketplace. He incorporated CogniSens, found nearby office space, lined up customers and helped come up with a catchy name. (NeuroTracker was originally called 3D-MOT, for 3-dimensional multiple-object tracking; players on Manchester United called it “ball-tracker”).Most teams were not willing to discuss their use of NeuroTracker — which has only one paid endorser, Aaron Cook, an Olympic taekwondo athlete — likely out of fear that their competitive advantage would be reduced. But the Atlanta Falcons were an exception, allowing Ryan to respond to questions.The Pro Bowl quarterback, who personally visited the lab in June 2015, said that NeuroTracker had improved his spatial awareness, the type of vision needed to scan the field for open receivers.“That’s key as a quarterback, to be able to see things and how they relate to each other really quickly,” Ryan said. “I think that’s exactly what NeuroTracker helps you do.”He considered it as crucial to his performance as lifting weights or training agility.“We spend a lot of time working on our bodies,” Ryan said. “It’s equally important to have your mind operating on a high level.”In fact, with a professional setup costing $6,000, NeuroTracker boasts that in only 12 training sessions lasting five minutes, athletes will begin to notice sustainable benefits to their on-field performance.“They will see it in their play,” said Castonguay, who is the lead investor in the company.These supposed benefits have varied. One of the earliest customers was Zaichkowsky, a longtime sports psychologist at Boston University who was hired by the Vancouver Canucks to introduce a sports science program in July 2010. He persuaded the front office to set up a NeuroTracker cave in the practice facility, at a cost then of around $40,000.“Conceptually and scientifically, it made a lot of sense,” said Zaichkowsky, now a member of CogniSens’ science board.Matt Fast, a professional golfer, was hoping to improve a different type of sustained attention when he began using NeuroTracker on the Web.com tour in 2014. He felt that when he played the chaotic ball-tracking game in the morning, he putted significantly better later in the day.“Everything would be blacked out except for what your eyes were looking at,” Fast said. “The times that I’ve putted the best were when I was using it. I totally believe in it.”Some were intrigued by NeuroTracker’s potential for data collection and as a scouting tool, including Jared Micklos, the director of the U.S. Soccer Development Academy. In the fall of 2014, he signed a three-year agreement with the company to test NeuroTracker on youth players at the Development Academy combine in June and December. He said the data was beginning to generate some interesting revelations about differences among positions.Now they can begin to track how players progressed from age 14 to 17, particularly those who have gone on to higher levels, like the national team.“Is there a correlation of the score?” Micklos said. “Are these high scores? If that’s the case, then, yeah, continuing to test might make sense.”Caroline Calvé, a Canadian snowboarder, said that if she had not retired last year she would still be using NeuroTracker. Before the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, Calvé started using the program along with other mental-training products to help her concentration, which she said was a mess during the 2010 Games in Vancouver.“It gave me the time to practice that focus,” Calvé said, adding: “It is tough to measure. It’s tough to say, ‘Is that why I did better? Is it because suddenly I felt I had more control so I gained more confidence?’ It’s so hard to tell.”Whatever the motivation, however, Calvé could not argue with the results. She jumped from No. 20 in 2010 to No. 6 in the parallel giant slalom in 2014.“The fact that I was practicing that focus was something that, yes, I feel helped me,” she said.When Nintendo started Brain Age in 2005 — a video game built around puzzles, testing nothing as it relates to Mario or Luigi, but rather the speed at which players could complete mental agility tasks like speed-counting, word memory and Sudoku — it was advertised as a method for “flexing your mental muscles.” It was based largely on the work of a renowned Japanese neuroscientist, and it sold well. A commercial race to bring cognitive-training applications into the mainstream ensued. By 2013, Lumosity, one of the most successful contenders, had reached 50 million members on the basis that playing its games could increase work or school performance.But the notion that practice at one task could effectively bolster abilities in another — called transfer — has long been disputed. In 1906, the psychologist Edward L. Thorndike found that rigorous practice helped students’ ability to estimate the areas of rectangles, but it did not help them estimate the areas of other shapes. Another century’s worth of research has continued to reshape and redefine, expand and restrict this line of thinking. Sir Charles Sherrington, the Nobel Prize-winning neurophysiologist, also believed that “acquisition of a habit is not transferable beyond its application.” K. Anders Ericsson’s seminal study on expertise — the so-called 10,000 hours rule — emphasized training that was specific to the skill. This meant that memorizing an extraordinary amount of numbers is not likely to yield improvement in your recall of names. Practicing Tetris can improve your ability to play Tetris, but it probably won’t help you get better at juggling.With NeuroTracker, Faubert has made some effort to rebut this, but not everybody has been persuaded. Williams, at the University of Utah, challenged the notion that tracking bouncing objects in a simulation could train or quantify anything other than a person’s ability to track bouncing objects in a simulation.“I’ve never seen a soccer player chasing multicolor balloons around on the field,” Williams said. “It’s just not what soccer players do.”What soccer players do, he said, is read patterns of play, anticipate what might happen next based on movements of teammates and opponents, and identify familiar sequences as they unfold. This “inside” knowledge, built up over time, promotes the effectiveness and efficiency that Ericsson argues are the hallmarks of expertise.Williams is not alone in his skepticism. In an exhaustive review published in the October issue of the journal Psychological Science in the Public Interest, researchers criticized the sweeping claims made throughout the $1.3 billion brain-gaming industry related to “cognitive improvement.” The researchers concluded that the evidence was “limited and inconsistent” that commercial brain-training software could enhance cognition outside the laboratory in the ways the companies described. (Last January, Lumos Labs, the maker of Lumosity, settled Federal Trade Commission charges of deceptive advertising for $2 million.)CogniSens was one of 30 companies that the lead author, Daniel J. Simons, used to support the study’s analysis, naming it as one of a dozen companies that cited no peer-reviewed evidence from intervention studies. Castonguay said he emailed Simons to explain that they had, in fact, published multiple studies supporting NeuroTracker’s work, but did not provide links on their website. (The website now lists 12 supporting papers and studies.)One of the studies was a paper by Faubert in the January issue of Psychology of Sports and Exercise that described a significant improvement in passing accuracy among players on the University of Montreal’s men’s soccer team after just 10 sessions of NeuroTracker. Those judging the accuracy of the passes, however, were the coaches — a subjective method of evaluation, even if they were doing their best to be truthful.Another often-cited study was conducted by researchers at the Institute of Exercise Physiology and Wellness at the University of Central Florida. Working with the Orlando Magic, they tested 12 players using NeuroTracker before the 2012-13 season and compared the results to their basketball statistics at the end of the year. They found that the players who scored better at NeuroTracker wound up with better numbers in assists and steals, and fewer turnovers.The authors did not mention that the Magic had a new coach that season, Jacque Vaughn, who promoted a more aggressive, up-tempo style of play than his predecessor, Stan Van Gundy, which could have accounted for the statistical uptick.Castonguay said it could be hard to get the sort of access needed for studies involving professional athletes. But, he said, “one thing is clear: We are the most evidence-based cognitive intervention in the world. No one comes close to us.”Faubert wrote an in email that perceptual-cognitive transfer is one of the “hard questions to answer” in sports, saying it is difficult to form “a broad conclusion on the efficiency or inefficiency of the training.” He added that “we and others have been building evidence for the fact that it does play a role, but many scientific questions remain.”Rob Gray, an associate professor in the Perception and Action Lab at Arizona State University, who hosts a popular podcast on sports-science topics, fretted that NeuroTracker removes too much of any sporting context to show the type of drastic transfer needed to go from excelling inside your living room to scoring more goals in the Premier League.“One of the big problems I have is that NeuroTracker’s motion is completely random and unstructured,” Gray said. “The whole point of watching a basketball scene if you’re a point guard is that it is structured. Picking up that structure that’s specific to your sport is highly important.”That so many successful teams and savvy athletes, like Ryan, would swear by NeuroTracker does not come as a total surprise.“If you practice anything long enough, you will get better at it,” Williams said. “If you get better at it, it improves self-confidence, self-esteem, so you feel as if you’re improving. This is essentially a placebo effect.”Some supporters feel that the NeuroTracker’s real problem might be that it is ahead of its time.“There’s finally an appreciation of the importance of the mind with the body in high-performance work,” said Zaichkowsky, the sports scientist. “We’ve never had the acceptable methodology to train it.”But that is where opinions about those methodologies diverge.Daniel M. Laby runs the Sports and Performance Vision Center at the State University of New York’s College of Optometry. The center has a small office space with basketballs and soccer balls strewn across the floor, near an indoor putting mat. Laby calls it his playroom.His job, though, involves testing the cognitive training equipment that is geared to sports. The room appears to be shrinking. It is getting harder to gauge what is useful, what is too early, what is junk. The products keep flowing into his office.“All the other routes to advantage have basically been exhausted,” Laby said. “Teams are looking for an advantage. That advantage is now felt to be in this area of sport science, and specifically in this cognitive-neural-vision realm.”The problem, Laby said, is that a genuine understanding of that realm is still nascent.Faubert noted this from the seat of his own exploration, his laboratory, as he explained the intuition that led him down the path to NeuroTracker. An athlete’s mental processing capability is like “that little sandwich part between all the physical abilities of an athlete, their know-how about the game,” he said. lThere is never a play that is exactly the same. For that uncertainty, athletes have to rely on something unpracticed, untrained. It might just be spatial awareness or concentration. It might be something only the eight yellow spheres can determine.“That capacity seems to be more important than people understand,” Faubert said. “I don’t know how important. But there’s no way these elite athletes would be so much better than the others, even amateur players, if it wasn’t important. That means it is critical. But how?”He let the question linger. One could almost see the balls scattering around his mind."
"Many Roles for Clemson’s Turnipseed, but One Goal: ‘Make Us Better’","Thad Turnipseed had a simple question when Clemson Coach Dabo Swinney, his old college teammate, tried to lure him to the Tigers’ staff in 2013: What do you want me to do?“He said, ‘Thad, I don’t care what you do,’” Turnipseed said in a telephone interview this week. Come, Swinney urged his old friend, and make us better.“‘I don’t care if you don’t do anything for a year,’” Turnipseed said Swinney told him. “‘Just come. Learn. Be around. When you see something that can make us better — make us better, go to the next thing.’”So Turnipseed went. In a matter of days — “I don’t know if it was the first week, the second week,” he said — he had his new title: director of recruiting. “A couple months later, I was director of recruiting and external affairs,” he said. “I think that’s what the title says now.”The fact that Turnipseed can be so casual about the label underscores the jack-of-all-trades role he has taken on with the Tigers, who enter Monday’s national championship game against Alabama looking to avenge last year’s title-game loss to the Crimson Tide.The fingerprints of Turnipseed, a 45-year-old former construction worker, are all over both teams: Before Swinney lured him to Clemson, Turnipseed spent 11 years in Tuscaloosa in a variety of behind-the-scenes roles as Coach Nick Saban laid the foundation for a program that is one win from his fifth national championship in eight years. On Monday, Turnipseed will get his second shot at delivering Swinney’s first title.Turnipseed is the rare figure who has endeared himself to both men, adapting to their personalities and the culture of their programs: the N.F.L.-style preparation of Saban, and the more-fun-the-better philosophy championed by Swinney.On the day of his initial visit to Clemson back in 2013, Turnipseed, a father of four, said that Swinney was “hugging every player, he’s asking about their extended family by name.”“Just a totally different atmosphere at Clemson than it was at Alabama,” Turnipseed added. “I’m not saying better. I’m just saying different.”“That atmosphere at Clemson, for a guy with young kids, a young family, that was the right fit for me at the time,” he said.Turnipseed, a former Alabama football player whose career ended early because of knee injuries, was the owner of a construction and flooring business in 2003 when Mal Moore, the Crimson Tide’s athletic director, came to him with a not-so-modest request.“Mal Moore sees me at a basketball game, asks me for a donation for this new capital campaign he was going to kick off,” said Turnipseed, who played at Alabama during Moore’s years as an assistant coach there. “I said, ‘Mal, I can’t give that much to you, but I’ll come build it for you.’ I said it just jokingly, and the next thing you know, within a week I was selling my company, getting ready to go to Alabama.”He started as the director of capital projects, working his way up to roles as associate athletic director for special projects and, more important, as Saban’s director of football external affairs. The catchall job titles forced Turnipseed to perform many duties; he helped to design and oversee more than $200 million in athletic projects, including stadium renovations and expansions, and helped to build a room in Saban’s house dedicated to recruiting.At Clemson, Turnipseed was tasked with building the Tigers’ recruiting department, which has added positions with new-media-era titles — assistant director of football operations and creative media, director of new and creative media, coordinator of digital content — not to mention dozens of student helpers. These seemingly amorphous roles are all aimed at spreading Clemson’s message in forward-thinking ways, using social media to connect with recruits from a distance while also monitoring their behavior for potential red flags.Since he arrived, Clemson’s recruiting class rankings moved from No. 13 to No. 4 to No. 6 nationally, according to Rivals.com. Better players have yielded better results: Swinney’s Tigers are 27-2 over the past two seasons.“I certainly don’t think that it’s any surprise to me that the things that he’s responsible for, because of the pride in performance that he has as a person, that he wouldn’t do a fantastic job of,” Saban said in a teleconference on Tuesday. “I know he’s impacted their recruiting in a very positive way.”Turnipseed, a linebacker on the Crimson Tide’s 1992 national title team, said he endeared himself to Saban — who was hired by Moore in 2007 — early on because of his experience as a former Alabama football player. He has joked that his job titles were simply code for “keep Nick happy,” as he did virtually everything for Saban that did not involve the X’s and O’s of football. That included not only multimillion-dollar stadium projects, but also acting as a buffer for Saban and making sure the coach had influential people in front of him at speaking events.It was around the time of Moore’s death, in 2013, that Swinney, a receiver on that 1992 Alabama team, made a push to hire him at Clemson. Turnipseed had aspirations of becoming an athletic director himself but seemed to have hit a professional ceiling at Alabama. So he made his own recruiting visit to Clemson to see Swinney.“His pitch to me was this: ‘Thad, you’ve done everything you can do at Alabama. The one thing you haven’t been a part of is a staff. You might like it and stay forever, but worst-case that will help you be an A.D. anywhere you want to go,’” Turnipseed said. “And he was right. And it’s funny how you plan your life and God will change it, because I always thought I’d be an A.D.; now I’m thinking it’s pretty good to be on a football staff. I really enjoy the relationships with the players.”"
Chelsea’s Streak Ends at 13 With Loss to Tottenham,"LONDON — Dele Alli bolstered his growing reputation by putting a stop to Chelsea’s 13-match winning streak, scoring two goals on headers on Wednesday to give Tottenham Hotspur a 2-0 home victory over the Blues, the Premier League leaders.Defense has been the bedrock of Chelsea’s three-month hot streak, but Alli found space to score nearly identical goals, one in each half, after connecting with crosses from Christian Eriksen.Alli, 20, who has now scored seven goals in four games, helped hand Chelsea its first loss since its last trip to north London, at Arsenal in September, and prevented the Blues from earning a league-record 14th successive win in a single season.“This league is very tough,” Chelsea Manager Antonio Conte said. “Now it’s important to restart. After 13 wins in a row, it’s difficult to accept defeat.”Chelsea still leads Liverpool by 5 points, but Tottenham is now only 7 points behind in third after a fifth successive victory.“It’s a big statement for us, but we are happy to stay under the radar,” said Alli, whose team had its hopes for its first title since 1961 ended by Chelsea last season.Conte established the winning run that sent Chelsea to the top of the standings when he switched to a three-man defense, stemming a wave of goals that peaked in a 3-0 first-half collapse at Arsenal in late September.But the defense is now leaking again, having conceded four goals in the last two matches after letting in only two in the previous 12. Tottenham matched Chelsea’s formation and gave it few chances while proving more cohesive and solid at the back, frustrating the Blues’ forward line.Alli said, “I didn’t get on the ball as much as I would have liked to.” But he ultimately did not need to.Tottenham Coach Mauricio Pochettino had described Alli on the eve of the game as the “most important player to emerge in English football in recent years.” Signed two years ago from third-tier Milton Keynes Dons for 5 million pounds (about $8 million at the time), Alli lived up to his manager’s exalted praise on Wednesday with his mastery of the attacking spaces.Chelsea appeared more likely to score on the counterattack in the first half, but Tottenham used a break to devastating effect just before halftime.Kyle Walker set up Eriksen, and as the cross floated into the penalty area, Alli, left unmarked between Victor Moses and César Azpilicueta, coolly nodded the ball past goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.Chelsea was assertive at the start of the second half, but Tottenham preserved its lead. Goalkeeper Hugo Lloris blocked a low shot from Diego Costa, and a low header by Eden Hazard was off target. Moses appealed for a penalty kick after he was clipped by Tottenham midfielder Mousa Dembélé, but his pleas were dismissed.Spurs then punished Chelsea’s porous defending again in the 54th minute, with a replica of the opening goal.Walker did the running down the right flank before laying the ball off for Eriksen, who picked out Alli between Moses and Azpilicueta. Alli once again found the target from near the back post with his header.“We were short of the levels we set ourselves, for whatever reason that may be — a few misplaced passes and not moving the ball as quick as we have been,” Chelsea defender Gary Cahill said. “They are a top-quality opposition, and we got punished for being short.”"
"Milt Schmidt, Hall of Fame Center for Bruins, Dies at 98","Milt Schmidt, a Hockey Hall of Fame center who propelled the Boston Bruins to two Stanley Cup championships and became one of the franchise’s most revered figures, died on Wednesday at a hospice facility in Needham, Mass. He was 98.The cause was a stroke, his daughter, Nancy Sommer, said.Schmidt, who the National Hockey League said had been its oldest living player, spent 16 seasons with the Bruins before serving as their coach and general manager. He led the N.H.L. in points in the 1939-40 season and won the Hart Trophy as the league’s most valuable player in 1951. He was a three-time first-team All-Star, in years when the N.H.L. had six or seven teams.A superb skater and an outstanding stick-handler, the rugged Schmidt is best remembered as the center, and the key figure, on the Bruins’ so-called Kraut Line of the late 1930s and 1940s: three childhood buddies of German descent who had played together in junior hockey and the minor leagues.Schmidt and his linemates, left wing Woody Dumart and right wing Bobby Bauer, had grown up together in Ontario, and each signed with the Bruins’ organization in the mid-1930s. While playing for the Providence Reds of the American Hockey League in the 1936-37 season, they were linked by their coach, Albert Leduc.Schmidt recalled in a 2002 interview for the Hockey Hall of Fame: “He said: ‘All of you fellas come from Kitchener-Waterloo. There’s a lot of people of German descent from there. We gotta get a name for ya — the Kraut Line.’”The line made its debut in the last game of the 1936-37 season, and the three went on to finish atop the N.H.L. in points in 1939-40: Schmidt had 52 points in a 48-game season; Dumart and Bauer each tallied 43. The linemates spurred the Bruins to a Stanley Cup championship in 1939, teaming with stars like Eddie Shore and Dit Clapper and the outstanding rookie goaltender Frankie Brimsek. The Bruins won another Stanley Cup title in 1941, with all but Shore still in the lineup.Schmidt was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961. Dumart followed him in 1992, and Bauer was elected posthumously in 1996.“Schmidt was the fastest playmaker of all times,” Art Ross, his longtime general manager, was quoted as saying by Sports Illustrated in 1957. “No player ever skated at the tilt Schmidtty did and was still able to make the play.”Milton Conrad Schmidt, a son of German immigrants, was born on March 3, 1918, in Kitchener, previously known as Berlin in recognition of its large German population. (Its name was changed with the coming of World War I.)The glory years of the Schmidt-Dumart-Bauer line — sometimes known as the Kitchener Kids — essentially ended on Feb. 10, 1942, when the linemates combined for 10 points in an 8-1 Bruins rout of the Montreal Canadiens at Boston Garden. That was the last game for Schmidt, Dumart and Bauer before they entered the Royal Canadian Air Force together.At game’s end, players from both teams hoisted the linemates on their shoulders, with the crowd roaring in tribute as they headed off to World War II. Schmidt, Dumart and Bauer played together on a Canadian military hockey team and then served together at an air base in northern England.The line passed into Bruins history when Bauer retired in 1947. But the linemates were reunited on March 18, 1952, when Bauer returned for a single game on a night the fans honored Schmidt and Dumart. Bauer teamed with Dumart for assists on the 200th goal of Schmidt’s career in a victory over the Chicago Blackhawks.Schmidt retired as a player in December 1954, when he was named the Bruins’ coach. His career totals were 229 goals — the most in Bruins history at the time — and 346 assists.Schmidt coached the Bruins until 1966, with the exception of the 1961-62 season, and then moved into the front office. He engineered a one-sided trade with Chicago to obtain Phil Esposito and served as general manager when the Bruins, led by Bobby Orr and Esposito, won Stanley Cup championships in 1970 and 1972.Schmidt became the general manger of the expansion Washington Capitals in 1974 and later coached them. He left both posts midway through the team’s second season.In addition to his daughter, Schmidt, who lived in Westwood, Mass., is survived by a son, Conrad; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. His wife, the former Marie Petersen, died in 1999.Schmidt was the last survivor of the Kraut Line. Bauer died in 1964 and Dumart in 2001.In 1996, when Schmidt received the Lester Patrick Trophy, awarded by the N.H.L. for outstanding contributions to hockey in the United States, he reflected on his life.“When you’re a boy, maybe 8, 9, 10 years of age, back home in Canada, listening to hockey — I guess it was a radio or a crystal set — you’d be dreaming about what it would be like to win various trophies, such as the Stanley Cup, the M.V.P.,” Schmidt told The Boston Globe. “Gee, you might have thought, what a thrill that would be. My goodness. A kid from Kitchener, and all the dreams came true.”"
New Stat for a Slugger: Back Page Appearances,"Late in October, while the postseason was underway, two top Mets officials traveled to Manhattan to meet with Yoenis Cespedes’s agents: Brodie Van Wagenen and Kyle Thousand.Cespedes was about to become a free agent and the Mets wanted to keep him right where he was — in the middle of their lineup. Cespedes was interested in staying in New York, too. The issue was how much money that would take.Van Wagenen and Thousand made their case to Sandy Alderson, the Mets’ general manager, and John Ricco, the team’s assistant general manager, that it should be a lot of money, but their presentation was not a standard one. In an era in which data in sports has exploded, Van Wagenen and Thousand attempted to calculate Cespedes’s overall dollar value to the Mets, while not relying solely on his baseball statistics.With the help of an analytics firm in Chicago, they came up with a dollar figure for the impact Cespedes had on the field, social media, team television revenues, and ticket and merchandise sales.They even put a figure, $3.2 million, on the value of the approximately 50 tabloid back pages that had featured Cespedes over the course of 2016. Cespedes playing with flair, Cespedes hitting game-changing home runs, Cespedes driving exotic cars in spring training, Cespedes arriving for a workout on horseback. If it went on a back page of The New York Post, The Daily News or Newsday, it counted in the calculations.From all this — which Van Wagenen and Thousand presented in a 100-page book — they came up with a bottom line: Cespedes was worth $34.7 million to the Mets in 2016, or $7.1 million more than the team had paid him.The message was clear. The Mets, who play in a big market but are restrained in their spending, could afford an expensive — at least for them — new multiyear contract for Cespedes, arguably the most dynamic baseball player in New York. They would make it back, and more.In the end, the Mets, the two agents and Cespedes agreed on a new four-year, $110 million deal.It was not a huge contract by baseball standards, but for the Mets it was a big one. So the question is whether the analytics that Van Wagenen and Thousand used influenced the Mets to pay Cespedes, who will be 35 in the last year of the contract, more than they might have otherwise.That is hard to say. The Mets, after all, knew how important Cespedes was to their club. In one and a half seasons with him batting third or fourth, they had gone to the postseason twice, including the 2015 World Series. Without Cespedes in the lineup, the Mets were nowhere near as dangerous.When Alderson was asked recently about the strategy employed by Van Wagenen, an agent with CAA Sports, and Thousand, of Roc Nation Sports, he said he was intrigued by their presentation.“I think the general concept that some players are worth a little more than just the sum of their plate appearances is valid,’’ Alderson said. “It has to be taken into account.’’If nothing else, the collection of back pages made an impression on Jeff Wilpon, the Mets’ chief operating officer, who brought them up at a news conference announcing Cespedes’s re-signing.Van Wagenen says he believes he and Thousand are onto something new and have even given their approach a name — value above replacement — which is a nod to a popular advanced statistic called wins above replacement, better known as WAR.Van Wagenen said he wanted to give teams “a different way to look at players,’’ saying, “Whether or not teams are ready to look at it this way or not, time will tell.’’He added that Cespedes was the first player for whom they had tried the approach, but that it would be done for others.Agents battle one another for clients and are not exactly members of a mutual admiration society, so it was unsurprising that several, when asked about the approach used by Van Wagenen and Thousand, said they were not sure it was all that new. They also suggested — perhaps again no surprise — that Cespedes should have gotten a bigger contract.In any case, it appears that the Mets had never before received such a presentation, one in which Van Wagenen and Thousand predicted that Cespedes would earn the club $160 million over the next four years even with season-by-season variances in his on-field numbers.Whether he earns that much for the Mets is anyone’s guess — Alderson indicated he was skeptical about the methodology used to arrive at that figure — but spring training is nearing and not long after that Cespedes will be back in Queens, ready to attract attention, and back pages, with his home runs and jaw-dropping throws from the outfield.“He obviously helps put butts in seats,’’ Wilpon acknowledged. “People want to see him.’’That is commonly known as star factor, or as Van Wagenen and Thousand might put it, value above replacement."
"Pets, Car Repairs and Mom: How College Football Players Use Their Stipends","CLEMSON, S.C. — Clemson safety Van Smith drives a BMW, but the car is long past its days as a ride of luxury. It is a 1999 sedan with 300,000 miles on its odometer. Like many college students, Smith holds his breath every time he turns the key in the ignition — hoping the car starts. One day in November, it didn’t.“The starter went out in the middle of campus,” Smith said. “It cost $400. I had to get it towed up the street. Not cheap.“So, yeah, the $388 stipend we get? I need that.”Smith was referring to the $388 monthly stipend that Clemson players receive during the academic year. The payments, approved by the so-called Power 5 conferences in 2015, were created to supplement players’ athletic scholarships to meet what is known as the full cost of attendance. They vary, sometimes widely, from college to college, but they are paid to almost every player in major college football, including the ones from Clemson University and the University of Alabama who will play for the national championship on Monday.The stipends, which are meant to cover costs not included in a traditional athletic scholarship, have been allowed since before last season. The move came after the so-called Power 5 conferences, acting with the autonomy newly granted them by the N.C.A.A., voted to enlarge the grant-in-aid given to scholarship athletes to include the full cost of attendance. That figure is the more expansive measurement that every college already calculates, and it encompasses expenses like rent, cellphone bills and trips home.The decision to introduce the stipends after years of objections from the N.C.A.A. came in response to outside pressure — from essays to lawsuits — criticizing colleges for not sharing more of the money they earned off their athletes. But it also came because of the continually rising amount of cash produced by innovations like the College Football Playoff itself, which is currently in the third year of a 12-year, $7.3 billion deal with ESPN. (That contract allowed the playoff to return $425 million to the 20 Football Bowl Division conferences and the few remaining independents in 2015-16, money they added to the hundreds of millions of dollars they already divide up every year for the television rights to their regular-season games.)How the players use the stipend money is up to them. Before his car repair, Smith used part of his to cover the $100 fee his younger brother needed to play football at his high school. Tigers right guard Tyrone Crowder said he decided to spend some of his on a pet but, unable to keep a cat or dog where he lives, he bought a fish tank instead. “Fish are relatively cheap,” he said.University of Washington defensive tackle Greg Gaines uses his stipend to keep his 2002 Mercury Mountaineer running. His teammate Chico McClatcher, like several other players interviewed over the past month, said he saved his stipend to pay for Christmas presents. Huskies running back Myles Gaskin and right tackle Kaleb McGary said they liked the feeling of having a little cash on hand to give to someone living on the streets in Seattle, a city with a significant homeless population.“The stipend,” McGary said, “means I might have a few extra dollars and I can run in the store and buy bread and some peanut butter and jelly for somebody on the street.”Clemson linebacker Dorian O’Daniel ticked off expenses not covered by his athletic scholarship. Car repair bills, gas and groceries were all on the list. The new stipend, he said, means he does not have to call home and ask for money to solve every inconvenience.“It’s not enough,” O’Daniel said. “I know, beggars can’t be choosers, but it’s still not enough. But I’m thankful for what I get.”Clemson defensive end Clelin Ferrell, the defensive most valuable player in the Tigers’ 31-0 victory over Ohio State in the Playoff semifinals on Saturday, has his stipend check sent to his mother, Faye, a veteran of the first Iraq war, who lives in Richmond, Va.“My mom was, ‘Are you sure you want this sent to me?’ ” said Ferrell, whose father died when he was 13. “And I was like, ‘Yeah, Mom.’ Money is not a big thing with me. I will tell her how much money I need from that check, and she will send some back.”For some players, the stipend takes care of rent and food, and that’s it. At Washington, freshmen receive $300 a month because they are required to live in a dorm. Older players who choose to live off campus are eligible to receive $1,600 a month to cover rent, groceries and utilities.“My roommate and I pay $2,000 a month for an apartment,” McGary said. “I’m paying the extra for sleep, so I can be close to class and don’t have to go as far as these guys who live 15 minutes away in a cheaper place.”Gaskin, the Huskies running back, said: “The stipend money is not enough, if you really look into it. It is definitely under the poverty line in Seattle, because of the rents in Seattle. It hurts your pockets to live close to campus because of the rent, so the money forces you to make a whole lot of decisions. You have to be smart with your money.”That leaves little room for splurges on things like clothes. Ferrell said his favorite brand of clothing right now is “Clemson,” a style choice echoed by Washington defensive lineman Elijah Qualls.“I love the University of Washington,” Qualls said, “but I would like to wear something without a W on it. Something that is not purple.”Some of Qualls’s check covers the expenses of his dog, a Husky named Storm. When he was in Atlanta for a week to play Alabama in a Playoff semifinal, the extra money came in handy: It allowed him to pay friends to take care of Storm while he was away.The rest of his money goes toward housing and the upkeep of his car, a 2007 Dodge Charger with 200,000 miles.When the full-cost-of-attendance stipends were approved two years ago, there was worry among some college administrators that athletes would waste the money on frivolous purchases. But Georgia running back Nick Chubb said he saves his money every month, and his teammate Jeb Blazevich said he was surprised to learn how many Bulldogs send the money home to their families as soon as they receive it.“That blew me away,” said Blazevich, a tight end from Charlotte, N.C. “That’s the thing that got me to love this team so well, just seeing these guys’ heart and sending the stipend home. These guys are good guys, and they want to do well by their family.”He added: “People can be changed by money, but these guys are helping their mom out with a phone bill, or making a car payment. Wow.”"
A Bathroom Bill Could Cost Texas Some Sports Events,"When Texas officials unveiled a bill Thursday that would require people to use some bathrooms corresponding with their genders at birth, it drew unavoidable comparisons to a similar law passed last year in North Carolina. It also raised the prospect of a new confrontation with college sports officials and professional sports leagues, which pulled several prominent competitions from North Carolina in light of its law and now could face pressure to back away from one of the country’s largest and most sports-mad states.The North Carolina law, known as House Bill 2 or HB2, curbed anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, leading to protests, boycotts and criticism from business interests in the state.The Texas bill, which was revealed by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick at a news conference on Thursday, is known as Senate Bill 6. It would require transgender people to use bathrooms in government buildings and public schools and universities based on their “biological sex,” overruling any contrary local rules. While it faces similar pushback from business groups, the bill has the support of the state’s attorney general.North Carolina’s law had significant consequences for sports in that state. Its passage prompted the N.B.A. to withdraw this season’s All-Star Game from Charlotte; led the N.C.A.A. to move all of its playoff games in several sports — including first- and second-round games in its most prominent event, the Division I men’s basketball tournament — out of the state; and compelled the Atlantic Coast Conference to relocate several championships, including one in football.Texas could face similar actions should the bill pass.Most notably, Houston is set to host the Super Bowl on Feb. 5. It is almost impossible for the N.F.L. to move the sports world’s single biggest annual event, which is planned years in advance and involves millions of dollars in commitments, on such short notice. But the N.F.L. has penalized host cities before.In 1990, the league voted to hold the 1993 Super Bowl in Arizona, but after state lawmakers refused to make Martin Luther King Jr. Day an official state holiday, the game was moved to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. In 1992, Arizona reversed course and recognized the holiday, and the state has hosted several Super Bowls since.The N.F.L. has already awarded additional Super Bowl hosting rights through 2021; none of those games is scheduled to be played in Texas.Aside from the Football Championship Subdivision title game, which features James Madison against Youngstown State on Saturday in Frisco, Tex., the N.C.A.A. has a little more time to consider what to do with its events. Those include this season’s women’s basketball Final Four, which is set for early spring in Dallas, and next season’s men’s Final Four, currently scheduled for the Alamodome in San Antonio.Following the North Carolina controversy, the N.C.A.A. recently began quizzing current and prospective host cities, asking them “to specifically outline how they will protect participants and spectators from discrimination,” including details on how they would mitigate any local discriminatory laws or rules that permit the refusal of services to members of any group. The N.C.A.A. did not comment Thursday.One of the justifications the N.C.A.A. cited for its decision to remove its championship events from North Carolina was the fact that at least five states — New York, Minnesota, Washington, Vermont and Connecticut — had banned state employees and representatives from some travel to North Carolina.Like the North Carolina-based A.C.C., which moved some of its championships out of the state, the Texas-based Big 12 is a major conference that could now face similar decisions. The Big 12 is set to stage its first football championship game in several years in December at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, and it holds championships for a variety of other sports in Texas.“We will track the bill’s progress through the Legislature, and at an appropriate time discuss its impact with our member institutions,” a Big 12 spokesman said Thursday."
N.B.A. Two-Minute Report Detects Problems on Play That Beat Knicks,"A day after a last-second loss to the Milwaukee Bucks, the Knicks received a bit of additional sting in the form of the N.B.A.’s report on the last two minutes of the game.On Thursday, the league office released its report on the calls and noncalls by referees in the game’s last two minutes, something it does for any game in which the teams are within 5 points with that amount of time remaining. For the Knicks, who lost by 105-104 to Milwaukee on Giannis Antetokounmpo’s jump shot at the buzzer on Wednesday, it was only more salt in the wound.The report said Antetokounmpo had technically committed an offensive five-second violation. With 7.8 seconds left, he took an inbounds pass and began dribbling near the baseline with his back to the basket, starting the five-second count. He turned to shoot with 2.2 seconds left, which would have been a violation.The 6-foot-11 Antetokounmpo sank the shot over Lance Thomas to give the Bucks the win and the Knicks a sixth straight loss. The foul was detectable only with the help of a stopwatch, the report said, and thus was not ruled an incorrect noncall by the referees.But that final play was messy in other ways. The report also found that the Knicks’ Carmelo Anthony had committed a defensive three-second violation with 4.8 seconds left by standing in the lane without guarding anyone — though that was deemed “incidental or immaterial” to the possession’s outcome and thus was not ruled an incorrect noncall. The report also said the referees had been right not to call a loose-ball foul on the Knicks’ Joakim Noah and the Bucks’ Greg Monroe for briefly engaging near the basket during the shot.That final possession came after the Knicks’ Derrick Rose had fumbled an inbounds pass from Anthony while being guarded by Antetokounmpo. After the loss, Rose intimated that a foul should have been called. Instead, the report said the referees had been correct to avoid assessing a foul against Antetokounmpo and in overturning the initial ruling, which had given the ball to the Knicks."
"Chris Berman Steps Back, Back, Back, but Not Away, from ESPN","Chris Berman, the longtime ESPN broadcaster and six-time national sportscaster of the year, will give up many of his on-air responsibilities, the network said Thursday.In his new role, Berman, who joined ESPN one month after it went on the air in 1979, will make occasional broadcast appearances and will serve as a spokesman for the network at some events.Although Berman, 61, will be a less visible presence after the Super Bowl, he will continue to offer opinions and perspective on N.F.L. events and appear weekly on “Monday Night Countdown.” He will also handle play-by-play duties for ESPN Radio during the baseball divisional playoffs, and participate in the annual ESPY Awards.“It is all good, I get to stay here and be involved with football and baseball and the ESPYs and some things still to be defined,” Berman said. “This has kind of been in the works in my head and in this place’s head, and we finally figured it out.”Best known for his work on ESPN’s anchor show “SportsCenter,” Berman has been the face of ESPN for more than three decades, and has made some of its most memorable calls. He said one stood out: Cal Ripken setting baseball’s consecutive games played record in 1995.“That stood as more than even a baseball accomplishment,” Berman said. “It was like America: go to work every day for 14½ years and not call in sick. That’s a night I still get tears speaking about.”James Harden scored 26 points and Nene made two free throws with 0.7 seconds remaining to lift the Houston Rockets to their sixth straight win, 118-116, over the visiting Oklahoma City Thunder.Houston overcame Russell Westbrook’s 49 points, though he struggled down the stretch as Oklahoma City dropped its third straight game.The Rockets had a 14-point lead early in the fourth quarter before their offense stalled, and the Thunder went on a 20-7 run to cut the lead to 107-104 with under 6 minutes left. The Thunder took a lead but Harden tied the score 116-116 with two free throws with under 2 minutes to go.The teams combined to miss seven shots after that, with Westbrook missing three in that span, before Nene’s free throws.PACERS TOP NETS Jeff Teague had 21 points, 15 assists and 7 rebounds, and Myles Turner finished with 25 points and 15 rebounds as the Indiana Pacers beat the visiting Nets, 121-109. The Nets have lost four straight and nine of 11 over all.Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill was ruled out of Sunday’s playoff game at Pittsburgh and the backup Matt Moore will start in his place for the fourth straight game.The Dolphins announced that Tannehill would sit out after determining that he was still not ready to practice because of a sprained left knee.Moore, a 10-year veteran, will be making his first career postseason start. If the Dolphins beat the Steelers, Tannehill could be ready for a divisional playoff game at New England on Jan. 14.Edgardo Alfonzo, the former star infielder for the Mets, will manage the Brooklyn Cyclones, the Mets’ Class A short-season affiliate, for the 2017 season.Alfonzo, 43, spent eight of his 12 seasons in the major leagues with the Mets. From 1995 to 2002, he hit .292, with 120 home runs and 538 R.B.I., and became a fan favorite for his clutch hits. In 2000, he hit .324 with 25 home runs and 94 R.B.I. and helped propel the Mets to the World Series.Alfonzo began coaching with the Cyclones in 2014 and served as the bench coach last season. He will replace Tom Gamboa, who retired.  JAMES WAGNERTop-seeded Andy Murray struggled to beat Nicolas Almagro, 7-6 (4), 7-5, in the Qatar Open quarterfinals while the defending champion Novak Djokovic dispatched the qualifier Radek Stepanek, 6-3, 6-3, in Doha.Murray, a two-time champion at the tournament, trailed 3-1 in the first set and squandered a 2-1 lead with a service break in the second set.In the semifinals, Murray will play third-seeded Tomas Berdych. Djokovic will face Fernando Verdasco.Jimmy Walker, last year’s winner at the P.G.A. Championship, shot an 8-under-par 65 to take the first-round lead in the SBS Tournament of Champions in Kapalua, Hawaii.Jim Herman, Justin Thomas and Ryan Moore were two strokes back."
James Harden Meets Russell Westbrook in a Battle of Perpetual Motion,"At the end, they embraced. After spending so much of the evening jostling for position and searching for daylight, James Harden of the Houston Rockets and Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder, two players in perpetual motion, finally stood still long enough to hug each other. It was a sign of mutual respect between former teammates.“He’s a problem, man,” Harden told David Aldridge of TNT after the game. “He never gives up, never quits.”The Rockets had outlasted the Thunder for a 118-116 victory at Toyota Center in Houston on Thursday night — a game that once again showcased the dynamic offense that these two players, both leading M.V.P. candidates, have produced this season. Westbrook finished with 49 points, 8 rebounds and 5 assists, while Harden collected 26 points, 8 rebounds and 12 assists as the Rockets (28-9) won their sixth straight.Perhaps the only surprise was that neither player had a triple-double, but such is the high bar they have set for themselves. Westbrook has 16 triple-doubles this season. Harden has nine, and he is less than a week removed from assembling one of the most ridiculous stat lines in league history: 53 points, 17 assists and 16 rebounds in a win against the Knicks last Saturday.Harden was less explosive against the Thunder — he shot just 6 of 16 from the field — but was a pass-first facilitator for his teammates throughout, and especially on the one possession when it mattered most. With little time remaining in a tie game, Harden felt two defenders converge on him near the 3-point line. So he threw a dart to teammate Nene Hilario, who was fouled with seven-tenths of a second remaining. Hilario made both free throws, and the Rockets emerged victorious — despite having given up an 18-point lead.“No matter if it’s fourth quarter with three seconds to go or first quarter with 10 minutes to go, I’m going to make that pass,” Harden told reporters. “And my teammates know that.”Harden and Westbrook, who were teammates on the Thunder for three seasons, from 2009 to 2012, now personify the sort of plutonium-fueled offenses favored by many of the league’s elite teams: lots of transition opportunities, lots of 3-pointers, lots of points.Scoring across the league is up this season — ESPN’s Zach Lowe detailed many of the factors — and one of the central figures in the movement, Rockets Coach Mike D’Antoni, had a courtside seat for Thursday’s game.In hindsight, D’Antoni was ahead of the curve when, as coach of the Phoenix Suns from 2003 to 2008, he had his players run at every opportunity. In later coaching stops with the Los Angeles Lakers and the Knicks, he had far less success. But with the Rockets this season, he got another opportunity. He has made the most of it.If the first half of the Rockets’ season is viewed as a referendum of D’Antoni’s offensive philosophies, well, it is difficult to see how they could be playing much better. On pace to demolish the league record for 3-pointers in a season, the Rockets are second in scoring behind the Golden State Warriors.More than just scoring in bunches, though, the Rockets are winning with balance and efficiency. Consider their effort against the Thunder (21-16). All five starters scored at least 10 points, and Eric Gordon, who is leading the league in 3-pointers this season, came off the bench to score 22 points.“We’ve got a bunch of guys who can make a lot of shots,” D’Antoni told reporters.The Thunder, meanwhile, were highly reliant on Westbrook, who was outstanding and sank a career-best eight 3-pointers. But he also attempted 34 of his team’s 91 shots.Without Kevin Durant, who left for the Golden State Warriors last summer, Westbrook has been carrying an almost impossible load for the Thunder this season. On Thursday, he seemed fully capable of pulling off another feat — at least until Harden found a teammate for the winning play."
Is Zaza Pachulia an All-Star? Many Fans Seem to Think So,"In the N.B.A.’s All-Star voting this season, a lot of names you might expect are at the top. LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, James Harden and Russell Westbrook have each cracked 400,000 votes.And so has Zaza Pachulia.For the second year in a row, Pachulia, the 32-year-old Golden State Warriors center from the Republic of Georgia, is getting vote totals that far exceed what his on-court performance would seem to deserve.Last season, when he played for the Dallas Mavericks, Pachulia finished fourth in Western Conference frontcourt voting behind Kobe Bryant, Durant and Kawhi Leonard, missing election by only 14,000 votes. This season, he ranks second behind Durant and is nearly 100,000 votes ahead of Leonard.It is a startling show of support for a player who is averaging 5.2 points a game this season and has never averaged more than 12.2 in his N.B.A. career.Last season’s surprise push for Pachulia was led by celebrity endorsers like the rapper Wyclef Jean, the teenage internet personality Hayes Grier and the president of Georgia, Giorgi Margvelashvili.Pachulia does have a following, and fans enjoy his occasional goofy celebration and unfamiliar accent. His memorable first name is probably also a factor. And don’t count out simple mischief. The stakes are a lot lower than in an important political election, so why not cast a “funny” vote?The situation is reminiscent of the N.H.L. All-Star Game last year, when a journeyman  enforcer named John Scott rode a wave of good-humored fan support to an improbable berth on the team. Amid discomfort from the league and some purist fans, he was traded and sent to the minor leagues. But he was allowed to play in the All-Star Game and scored twice to win the Most Valuable Player Award. The N.H.L. has since tweaked its rules to make minor leaguers ineligible for the game.A rule change in the N.B.A. means that despite his support, Pachulia will almost certainly not be suiting up as a starter for the game on Feb. 19 in New Orleans.Fan voting, formerly the sole criterion to determine starters, now accounts for only 50 percent. Media voting and player voting have been added and will count for 25 percent each. It is hard to see Pachulia finishing very high among either of those groups. And with coaches choosing the reserves, Pachulia probably won’t make the bench either."
U.S. Says Russians Were Behind Cyberattacks on Antidoping Agency,"United States intelligence officials have determined that last year’s cyberattacks on the World Anti-Doping Agency originated with the Russian government, perpetrated in apparent retaliation for what President Vladimir V. Putin deemed to be an American-led effort to defame Russia for widespread doping.That conclusion was published Friday in a declassified intelligence report ordered by President Obama. The report centered on Russia’s efforts to affect the 2016 American presidential election at Mr. Putin’s direction, while also referring to Russia’s related “influence efforts against targets such as Olympic athletes and other foreign governments.”“A prominent target since the 2016 Summer Olympics has been the World Anti-Doping Agency,” the report said.WADA, the global regulator of drugs in sports, commissioned numerous investigations into systematic Russian doping last year. In July, the agency recommended that Russia be barred from the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro for its state-sponsored doping program, which persisted for years and spanned disciplines.Weeks later, the regulator discovered that its database containing the private medical information of international athletes had been breached. A group identifying itself as Fancy Bear — a Russian cyberespionage group that forensics experts had tied to the Russian government — published the records of athletes who had received special clearance to take typically banned substances for medical reasons.In Friday’s report, American intelligence officials concluded that the Fancy Bear hacking had originated with Russia’s main military intelligence unit, the G.R.U., which had also begun working to influence the American election in March.Many of the records stolen from the doping regulator related to American athletes, including Simone Biles, the gymnast who won numerous medals in Rio, and the tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams. The release of the records was an apparent attempt to discredit the athletes and paint the United States as hypocritical, Friday’s report stated.On Friday, Catherine MacLean, a spokeswoman for the antidoping agency, pointed to the organization’s statement in September condemning the criminal activity and noted that the agency had “asked the Russian government to do everything in their power to make it stop.”Russian news media and sports officials have repeatedly invoked the stolen records in recent months, arguing that they are evidence of legalized doping and what they perceive to be the preferential treatment of Western athletes. Regulators and Olympic officials have repeatedly defended the affected athletes, noting that they followed proper procedure and received formal clearance.“Russia never had the opportunities that were given to other countries,” Vitaly Smirnov, a former top Russian sports official appointed by Mr. Putin to reform the nation’s antidoping system, said last month, referring to the hacked records as evidence. “The general feeling in Russia is that we didn’t have a chance.”"
"Even With Mr. Whammy, Nets Are No Match for LeBron James and the Cavs","LeBron James, playing for a Cleveland Cavaliers team well ahead of the pack in the N.B.A.’s Eastern Conference, blew once on his hand, then delivered a flawless free throw during warm-ups before Friday night’s game against the Nets.Players often say that practice cannot match game conditions, and this was never truer than in the case of James’s free-throw shooting at Barclays Center. That is because James’s shots, before a 116-108 victory over the Nets, occurred before the arrival of Bruce Reznick, 80, a retired lawyer from Brooklyn and a longtime Nets fan known as Mr. Whammy. Reznick was still en route to the arena via car service at the time with his wife, Judy, known as Mrs. Whammy.During the Nets’ games, Bruce Reznick stands a few feet in front of his seat behind the basket, jumps up and down and casts a spell on visiting team’s players to make them miss free throws.The antics between Reznick and James represent the longest-standing tradition in the relatively short history of James’s visits to Brooklyn. In 2015, James reportedly asked to have Reznick returned to his seat. The Cavaliers denied this, and James declined to comment at the time. Reznick called James a “crybaby,” and his exile was short-lived.Even after bringing a long-sought championship to Cleveland, James still did not have much to say about his Brooklyn foil.“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” James said before Friday’s game. When provided with a description, he said, “That older guy. Yeah, I’ve got no rivalry with him. You’re trying to create a story there.”Reznick does not see it that way. And considering James shot 62.5 percent from the free-throw line in 2015-16 at Barclays Center, well below his mark of 73.1 percent that season, Mr. Whammy may have a point.“I consider myself not just the rival of LeBron James but of every opposing player who comes through Barclays Center,” Reznick said, posing for selfies with fans after having arrived for Friday’s game. Sure enough, the Cavs finished just 8 of 18 from the free-throw line whenever they shot them on Reznick’s end of the court.Reznick and James faced off with 5 minutes 19 seconds left in the first quarter. “I know you can miss! Look at me! Gotta miss!” Reznick shouted, waving his arms next to the basket and jumping as James’s first shot rimmed out.But James has plenty of other things on his agenda, including the continued building of the Cavaliers as they defend their title. They made quick work of the Nets Friday, building a sizable cushion with a 13-0 run just before halftime.By the third quarter, the Cavs extended their lead to 24 points. The Nets fought back to cut the lead to single digits in the fourth, but ultimately saw their record fall to 8-27, a mirror image of Cleveland’s 27-8.And the Cavs, it appears, are about to get even better. Kyle Korver is reportedly headed to Cleveland from the Atlanta Hawks, and although the trade has yet to happen, James and his teammates sounded as if they had already begun counting the baskets that are sure to follow when James, who is second in the league on 3-point assists, teams up with Korver, a career 42.9 percent shooter from that distance.When a reporter pointed out Korver’s accuracy, James said: “It’ll go higher than that. We’ll get him the ball. He’s on the court for a reason.”Korver would help cover the loss of J. R. Smith, who is recovering from an operation on his thumb. The rest of Cleveland’s problems are short term. Kyrie Irving missed three games with a tight hamstring but returned on Friday night. James battled the flu. And Kevin Love lost 10 pounds after a bout with food poisoning that left him considering a trip to the hospital at 5 a.m. on New Year’s Day.Love did not offer a timetable for returning to sea bass, the offending dish on a team flight, saying instead he would stick with “chicken soup and the BRAT diet,” referring to a banana, rice, applesauce and toast regimen that helps alleviate stomach ailments.While the Cavaliers continued their pursuit of Korver, who would add an All-Star to a team that few think can be caught in the Eastern Conference, the Nets and Coach Kenny Atkinson found themselves playing Cleveland on the second night of a back-to-back, part of a stretch that takes them to three cities between Thursday and Sunday.On top of the busy schedule, key players such as Jeremy Lin and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson were either missing or hampered by injury, further limiting an already thin roster.“I think we look at these situations like we’re going to compete,” Atkinson said before the game, “but we’re going to see if we can steal a couple things.”He added: “Whether it’s an out-of-timeout play, the type of defense they’re playing, I feel like you can always pick up something. Maybe it’s a little more coach-driven, because we’re watching a lot more tape than the players, but Caris LeVert having to defend LeBron tonight, what a great learning experience.”James finished with 36 points. But Levert, a rookie guard who finished with 19, was not going it alone. He had some help.“I wish LeBron James, and every player who comes in here, good luck, good health, except when they come to Barclays Center,” Reznick said. “But here, they have to miss the shots.”"
"Willie Evans, Who Was Barred From a Bowl Game Because of His Color, Dies at 79","Willie Evans, who, as a standout halfback in 1958, helped the University of Buffalo secure its first invitation to a bowl game, only to be barred with a teammate from playing in it because they were black — a decision that so outraged the team that it refused to participate — died on Wednesday in Buffalo. He was 79.His wife, Roberta Evans, said the cause was injuries sustained in a fall.Evans, a varsity athlete in several sports in high school, had little experience with football before he started at the University of Buffalo (now the State University of New York at Buffalo) in the mid-1950s.Coached by Dick Offenhamer, known for his grueling training regimens, the Buffalo Bulls of Evans’s day were a close-knit, hard-hitting bunch. Evans, 6 feet tall and 182 pounds, played on the freshman team for most of 1956 but soon became a force on the varsity squad.The Bulls favored a punishing ground attack, and Evans led the team in rushing for the next three seasons. He scored nine rushing touchdowns and ran for 1,559 yards during his college career, averaging 6.36 yards per carry, a record that stands at the university.In 1958, with Evans carrying the ball 70 times for 530 yards, Buffalo went 8-1, beating a favored Harvard team, 6-3, and shutting out Bucknell, 38-0.“Willie Evans burst through right tackle for 47 yards and a touchdown with the game less than five minutes old, and the issue was never in doubt thereafter,” The Associated Press wrote about the blowout against Bucknell that November.That season the team won the Lambert Cup, awarded to the best small-college program in the East. A few days later, Buffalo received an invitation to play in the Tangerine Bowl in Orlando, Fla.But Orlando was in the segregated South, and the Orlando High School Athletic Association, which controlled the stadium, forbade blacks and whites to play together. Evans and Mike Wilson, a reserve end and the team’s only other black player, would not be allowed to play. It was a situation that the University of Buffalo team had not encountered in the Northeast.Offenhamer left it to the players to decide what to do. According to several accounts, they deliberated for only seconds before unanimously deciding to reject the offer. Their choice made national news.“My teammates were the real heroes,” Evans told The Buffalo News in 2011. “If you look back, it was not an easy thing to do.”Buffalo went 8-1 the next season, but the team was not invited to another bowl game that year. The university’s next shot at one did not come until 2009, when Buffalo lost to the University of Connecticut, 38-20, at the International Bowl in Toronto.Before that game’s kickoff, Evans and some of his teammates were invited onto the field, where they received a standing ovation from the more than 40,000 spectators.Willie Roy Evans was born on Dec. 1, 1937, in Buffalo, to James R. Evans and the former Anna York. He lettered in cross-country, basketball and track and field at what was then Emerson Vocational High School. But he did not play football until his senior year, because the school did not have a team until then.Evans worked as a tailor for a time after high school and was offered a track scholarship to Purdue University in Indiana, but he lost the scholarship because of an injury. The University of Buffalo also recruited him for track, but he wound up on the football field.He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in physical education in 1960 and was drafted by the Buffalo Bills of the newly formed American Football League. He was cut without playing in the Bills’ inaugural season.After working in insurance for a few years, he joined the Buffalo public school system, where he taught and coached cross-country, tennis, basketball, swimming and football. He earned a master’s degree in educational administration from Buffalo State College in 1988 and then worked as the director of physical education for the city of Buffalo.In addition to his wife of 44 years, the former Roberta Rozek, Evans, who lived in Buffalo, is survived by four sisters, Clara Small, Brenda Kendrick, Antoinette Sims and Paula Evans; two sons, Alan and Neal, both members of the jam band Soulive, and two daughters, Rachel and Rebecca Evans, all from his current marriage; a son, Rodrick, from an earlier marriage; and three grandchildren.Evans and some of his teammates remained close throughout the years, he told The Boston Globe in 2008, but the lost bowl game rarely came up when they got together.“No reason to harbor any bitterness about it,” he said. “I think we all felt that we had a very successful collegiate experience.”"
N.H.L.’s Emergency Goalies Are Ready to Answer the Call,"Tom Fenton was in a barber’s chair when he got the call. Nathan Schoenfeld was giving his 5-week-old twin boys a bath. Eric Semborski was at a suburban rink, teaching youngsters to play hockey.Within hours, each was wearing a mask, pads and an N.H.L. uniform as an emergency goaltender, to wait on the bench, just in case.Calling up someone with a bit of playing experience and saying, “Get your gear together, we need you,” is a storybook scenario for amateur athletes everywhere, and it is incredibly rare in American professional sports. But it has already happened a handful of times this season in hockey, most recently when the Carolina Hurricanes’ longtime equipment manager, Jorge Alves, made history as the first emergency goalie to play in an N.H.L. game in the modern era.“To actually get out there, all of a sudden the lights seemed brighter,” said Alves, who played at the end of Carolina’s game at Tampa Bay on New Year’s Eve. “The lights were brighter out there, and it was just like, ‘O.K., this is crazy.’”Alves, a 37-year-old former minor league goalie and a Marine, faced no shots. And he could not have cared less as he happily joined an exclusive club of emergency goalies. He had watched weeks earlier as Semborski, a program coordinator and youth hockey coach at the Philadelphia Flyers’ practice center, dressed for the Chicago Blackhawks on Dec. 3 when their goaltender, Corey Crawford, needed an emergency appendectomy.Semborski, 23, a former Temple University goalie, did not play against the Flyers, but he was on the bench in a No. 50 jersey with his name on it. He said facing shots from Patrick Kane and Co. during warm-ups had been “the best 15 minutes of hockey ever.”The emergency goalie situation might seem a bit odd, but it used to be chaotic, with a nebulous protocol. Then on March 3, 2015, the Florida Panthers were in a bind: Roberto Luongo left a home game against Toronto with an unspecified upper-body injury, and then his backup, Al Montoya, sustained a groin injury.Play was stopped while the goaltending coach Robb Tallas, a 41-year-old former N.H.L. goalie, prepared to go in — as did forward Derek MacKenzie as a last resort. The N.H.L. was asked if Tallas could actually take the ice, a question that created confusion. The problem resolved itself when Luongo rushed from a nearby hospital to return to the game.The N.H.L. instituted a rule for the following season requiring each team to have a list of local emergency goalie options for themselves and for visiting teams. And the lists have been needed.Matt Hewitt, a goalie at the University of British Columbia, got the call to be the backup for the Vancouver Canucks on Oct. 18 after hearing rumors on a group chat with his teammates that Ryan Miller might not be able to dress. His coach told him, “You’re going up to play in the big leagues.”Hewitt said, “I kind of just woke up not knowing anything, and all of a sudden here I am — I’ve got to get ready to gear up for the Canucks.”While Hewitt was at least an active goalie at the time, Fenton — who played for American International College — had not been in goal in months when the Coyotes called him for help in December 2010.Fenton was getting his hair trimmed at a Supercuts in White Plains when his phone kept vibrating. He finally answered the sixth call from the president of a local youth hockey organization, who said: “Pick up your phone, you dumb idiot. You’re going to play for the Phoenix Coyotes at Madison Square Garden.”Driving a friend’s S.U.V., Fenton made his way into Manhattan, parked in a public lot, dragged his equipment into the Garden and enjoyed what he considers one of the best days of his life — even though he did not play in the game. Near the end, Fenton said, the Coyotes’ captain, Shane Doan, tried to persuade the referees to give the backup goalie a penalty just to get him on the scoresheet.Fenton had to settle for a game puck.The Coyotes turned to Schoenfeld, a financial adviser and son of the former coach and player Jim Schoenfeld, last February. An injury to Anders Lindback took Schoenfeld from a Presidents’ Day off with family to the rink, where he got to back up Louis Domingue and enjoy the camaraderie of a winning locker room.“I was sitting there, and I stayed fully dressed,” he said, because his 2-year-old son was coming down to get some photos.“And I’m just listening to the guys talk, and Shane Doan gives me the M.V.P. belt,” Schoenfeld said, referring to a team award. “When that happened, that was kind of the icing on the cake of the whole thing.”Dave Ayres, who drives a Zamboni among his other duties as the manager of operations for the Mattamy Athletic Centre at the old Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, has dressed twice for the American Hockey League’s Marlies. Ayres had been pranked so many times before by the Marlies’ equipment staff that he did not believe he was really needed for a game last season in Rochester, N.Y., until the Maple Leafs assistant general manager Kyle Dubas told him: “Dave, no, we’re serious. We need you. So get your stuff in the truck — get driving.”Ayres arrived 20 minutes before warm-ups.In 2008, Brett Leonhardt got a few hours’ notice that Washington’s Jose Theodore was hurt. A website producer at the time after playing at Division III Neumann University, Leonhardt was the backup only until Semyon Varlamov could make it to the rink. But he said of warm-ups: “It’s like the greatest memory of your life.”Leonhardt backed up for an entire game in 2013, too, and is now the Capitals’ video coach.Another one-time emergency goalie is now living out his dream.Carter Hutton, who went undrafted, was playing during weekends on an A.H.L. amateur contract and studying at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell when the Flyers made him the backup for one game in March 2010.Hutton said he thought that exposure had helped him land a contract with the San Jose Sharks, and he is now a veteran of 88 N.H.L. games and serves as the full-time backup for the St. Louis Blues.Hutton happened to be on the ice for Hewitt’s big day and got to congratulate him.“It is very surreal, but make sure you soak it in, but still work hard and you never know,” Hutton said. “It’s such a unique situation where you get a guy, just a local guy or someone in the area that can play to be up there, and you’re one situation away from stepping on the ice to play in the N.H.L.”"
"In College Football, Taking Hits on Twitter Is Part of the Game","Clemson linebacker Ben Boulware is his team’s top tackler and a lightning rod for criticism on Twitter. Some of the posts curse him; others he laughs off.But one was way out of line. Boulware’s father had to contact the police after one person picked on the linebacker’s little sister.“Is it really that serious?” Boulware said. “You have to find my little sister and say something to her? It’s football. Sorry that I ruined your day so much, that I tackled your quarterback too hard. It’s ridiculous.”The bigger the stage, the more fans talk about and taunt college players behind a Twitter handle. It is a fact of life, circa 2017, and Boulware has made it to his sport’s biggest stage: the national championship game against Alabama on Monday night.“I hear it every day,” Boulware said. “I don’t care. If they want to take five minutes out of their day and tweet at somebody you don’t know, you’re a loser. Go do something with your life. Talking negative about somebody, it’s just so lame. Don’t you have something better to do?”Is the best option to shut up? Snipe back? Engage with the fan? Go dark?Boulware’s father, Jamie Boulware, contacted the Anderson County Sheriff’s Office after his daughter Bailee, a Clemson junior, received a threat. He said he had been told that it was not likely anything would come out of it.The Twitter fallout has lightened up since a 42-36 victory over Louisville on Oct. 1, Jamie Boulware said. He asked a couple of the offenders to visit him at the family tailgate so they could talk, but they did not take him up on it.“It’s a shame that these days people can say things like that without consequences,” he said.Most players try to restrain themselves from firing back.Clemson has a policy banning the use of social media during the season — a plan voted on by the players. Alabama Coach Nick Saban lets players know that what they say on social media is part of their “brand,” for better or worse.“This is sort of something that we’re constantly trying to address with players so that they can brand themselves in a positive way,” Saban said.Former players can only marvel at what their successors have to deal with. Greg McElroy, a former Alabama quarterback, said he did not think he would have been mature enough to handle the starting job as a freshman like Jalen Hurts, partly because of social-media critics.“I definitely couldn’t have handled it as an 18-year-old, especially if I was an 18-year-old in 2016,” said McElroy, now an analyst for the SEC Network. “It’s only been six years since I finished, and the world’s changed quite a bit in a very short period of time. It’s a tall order, for sure, and it does take a remarkable amount of maturity.”And restraint.Washington quarterback Jake Browning avoids some of the in-season attention, good or bad, by staying off Twitter. His last post before the Huskies’ semifinal loss to Alabama last weekend came on Aug. 7: “Hello fall camp. Goodbye Twitter.”Ohio State guard Billy Price, whose team lost to Clemson in the semifinals, said he “could get a false start, and I get crucified on Twitter.” He said it was a splash of reality because players have gotten so much in-person praise during their careers.“That’s the cold, hard truth of it,” Price said. “Especially in this program, because the truth comes at you fast. It’s hard, especially as a young guy when you’re not ready for that.”Players rarely hear nasty criticism until college, he said, “because you’re in high school and you’re around your hometown and people love you.”He added: “You go to Walmart, and people love you. You see the little old lady at church that loves you, and you give her a hug and say, ‘Hi, Mrs. Smith.’ But once you come here, the truth comes out. You got beat. You lost. Just get better. That’s what it comes down to.”Washington wide receiver Dante Pettis grew up seeing and hearing people criticize his father, Gary Pettis, a former major league outfielder who won five Gold Gloves and is now the Houston Astros’ third-base coach.“If that’s what they think, that’s what they think,” Dante Pettis said. “Maybe they’re jealous of where we are; maybe they wish they could be here. But at the end of the day, we know what we’re doing is good, so that’s all that matters.”Alabama tailback Damien Harris, one of the Crimson Tide’s more frequent online posters, said one user had said he hoped Harris would have a career-ending injury.Harris got some backlash in September after posting comments about a presidential debate, and it became a topic in his political communications class.“People were all like, ‘Stick to football,’” Harris said. “‘You don’t know what you’re talking about.’ So I’m like, ‘Since I play football, that means I can’t be involved in something that affects me?’ That stuff didn’t make sense. Just like everything else, you read it and then you move on.”Washington running back Myles Gaskin said he tried not to spend much time looking at responses to his posts. His solution: Block the worst offenders.“It’s definitely part of the game,” Gaskin said. “People are going to say what they’ve got to say, but at the end of the day, true fans of U.W. and anybody that supports this university, I feel like they’ll only give us constructive criticism. They’ll always have our backs.”He added: “Anybody that is out there saying mean stuff, I know you’ve got something better to do. Don’t bother me with it.”"
"Jeff Teague Keeps Pacers Rolling, Past Knicks","INDIANAPOLIS — Jeff Teague is providing the boost behind Indiana’s surging offense.“Jeff, to me, is the M.V.P. of this five-game win streak,” the veteran center Al Jefferson said after Teague and Paul George each scored 19 points to lead the Pacers to a 123-109 victory over the Knicks on Saturday. “He’s getting everyone involved and setting the tone.”Teague, who was 9 of 9 from the free-throw line, also had eight assists. The Pacers have scored more than 120 points in each of their last three games and at least 111 throughout their current streak, their longest of the season.Thaddeus Young had 16 points and 9 rebounds, C. J. Miles added 15 points off the bench, and the Pacers extended their streak of regular-season home wins over the Knicks to nine.“We have guys who can put the ball in the basket,” Pacers Coach Nate McMillan said. “In this winning streak, we have established that we can run the offense and focus on making the right plays.”Carmelo Anthony and Brandon Jennings each scored 17 points for the Knicks, who lost for the seventh time in eight games. Kristaps Porzingis made four 3-pointers and finished with 16 points.The Pacers used a 14-2 run at the start of the second quarter to pull away. A Teague 3-pointer with 49 seconds to go in the first half put the Pacers ahead by 60-40 before Porzingis answered with a 3-pointer of his own. Miles then scored to give Indiana a 62-43 halftime lead.The Knicks’ trip to Indiana fell on the second night of a back-to-back. The Knicks overcame an 18-point deficit on Friday at Milwaukee, ending a six-game skid, but a 29-point hole against the Pacers was too deep for them to escape.“We didn’t come out with enough energy, and they were playing real good basketball,” Porzingis said. “Once you get down big like we did, it’s tough to get back into the game.”Miles made a 3-pointer at the start of the fourth quarter, giving Indiana a 99-70 lead, and Jefferson drained two free throws to make the score 103-80. The Knicks then went on a 14-2 run, closing the gap to 11 when Mindaugas Kuzminskas dunked with 4 minutes 57 seconds left."
"N.F.L. Playoffs: Schedule, Matchups and Odds for the Next Round","The N.F.L. wild-card round did its job, eliminating those teams that limped into the playoffs while setting up more exciting matchups for the second weekend. Aaron Rodgers, fresh off another dominant performance, travels to Dallas to try and knock off the N.F.L.’s rookie sensations. Elsewhere, the Seahawks’ Legion of Boom faces a high-powered Falcons offense, the Patriots will take the Texans for a test drive on their way to the Super Bowl, and a banged-up Ben Roethlisberger leads the Steelers into Kansas City.Here’s a quick look at how the final 8 teams match up:No. 3 Seattle Seahawks (10-5-1) at No. 2 Atlanta Falcons (11-5)When: Saturday, 4:35 p.m. Eastern, FoxSpread: Falcons -4.5 pointsIt looked like a vintage Seahawks performance in the wild-card round, with the defense holding Detroit to 6 points as Thomas Rawls rumbled for 161 rushing yards, setting a franchise playoff record. But against the dynamic Atlanta offense, the absence of All-Pro safety Earl Thomas will be felt a lot more.No. 4 Green Bay Packers (10-6) at No. 1 Dallas Cowboys (13-3)When: Sunday, 4:40 p.m. Eastern, FoxSpread: Cowboys -4 pointsFor much of the season the Cowboys were the best and most consistent team in the N.F.L., but since the Packers and Aaron Rodgers closed the season with six consecutive wins, and then kept it going with a convincing wild-card win over the Giants, it is hard to argue there is a team playing better. The Cowboys are quite a challenge, though. If Green Bay works too hard to stop Ezekiel Elliott they may get burned by quarterback Dak Prescott, or vice versa.No. 3 Pittsburgh Steelers (11-5) at No. 2 Kansas City Chiefs (12-4)When: Sunday, 1:05 p.m. Eastern, NBCSpread: Chiefs -1 pointDespite a solid record, the Steelers of this season were not quite up to their celebrated predecessors, especially on defense. But in an easy wild-card win over Miami, Pittsburgh looked reborn into a hard-hitting unit capable of immense disruption. That being said, the Chiefs have come a long way since the Steelers crushed them 43-14 in Week 4, and have one of the few defenses that may slow down Le’Veon Bell and Antonio Brown, while also being a threat to score any time Tyreek Hill touches the ball.No. 4 Houston Texans (9-7) at No. 1 New England Patriots (14-2)When: Saturday, 8:15 p.m. Eastern, CBSSpread: Patriots -16 pointsThe Texans looked great in shutting down Oakland’s Connor Cook, but will face a quarterback this week with a bit beefier of resume. Tom Brady is a legitimate candidate for Most Valuable Player despite missing the first four weeks of the season because of a suspension, and even though the Patriots’ game plan is weakened significantly with the season-ending injury to Rob Gronkowski, they still have enough offensive options that the game seemingly borders on unfair.In a wild-card matchup billed as a top offense against a top defense, offense asserted itself, and the Green Bay Packers rolled to a 38-13 victory over the Giants.It was a slow start for Aaron Rodgers, but after the Packers finished the first quarter having been outgained by the Giants to the tune of 105 yards versus 7, the Packers’ quarterback found his way, throwing for four touchdowns and 362 passing yards.The matchup bordered on boring for much of the first half, with the Giants taking a 6-0 lead, but then took a number of dramatic turns, with Rodgers shredding the Giants’ secondary, including completing yet another Hail Mary to add to his collection. His latest came on a 42-yard heave to Randall Cobb as time expired in the first half, with the ball somehow finding its way past the entire Giants defense before landing in Cobb’s arms at the back of the end zone.While the Hail Mary led to the Packers leading 14-6 at halftime, the Giants looked like they could be on the comeback trail when they smothered the Packers on a few short running attempts in the third quarter leading to a turnover on downs. The Giants then capitalized on the Packers’ failure to convert with Eli Manning’s 41-yard touchdown to Tavarres King that made it a 14-13 game.Despite the Giants’ brief resurgence, the Packers’ offense was almost unstoppable even after losing Jordy Nelson for the game thanks to a hit to the ribs that he took in the first half. Nelson, the team’s top wide receiver, had just 1 catch for 13 yards, but Cobb more than made up for his absence by catching 5 passes for 116 yards. He tied the playoff record with 3 receiving touchdowns, and Davante Adams was nearly as good, contributing 7 catches for 107 yards and a touchdown.In a televised interview, Rodgers did not mince words when describing his struggles up until the final three minutes of the first half.“I was bad in the first half,” Rodgers said. “I was struggling to find a rhythm, they were covering really well, I took some sacks.”Rodgers cited his own problems with holding onto the ball in the pocket too long with creating some of the problems, but was in a jovial mood despite enduring five sacks from the Giants’ hard-hitting defense.The Packers’ defense, meanwhile, held tough holding the Giants to a pair of field goals despite a huge early yardage deficit, and then closed the game out strong. Manning finished the game having completed 23 of 44 passes for 299 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception, never looking comfortable on Green Bay’s side of the field. Giants receiver Odell Beckham Jr. struggled against a banged-up Packers secondary, dropping two passes in the first quarter and failing to have an impact in the second half.After a wild-card weekend of games that were seemingly never in doubt, much was made about the potential competitiveness of this game, and it delivered for the most part despite the lopsided result.The Giants had finished the season tied for the second best record in the N.F.C., but were forced to go on the road because the Packers were division champions. The cold weather at Lambeau Field was no problem for a Packers’ offense that was the hottest in the N.F.L. over the course of a six-game winning streak that culminated with the team winning the N.F.C. North on the last day of the season. During the streak, Rodgers threw 15 touchdowns and 0 interceptions, and including today’s game he has now thrown 22 touchdowns since his last interception.On a cold day in Pittsburgh, going up against a team loaded with big names, the Miami Dolphins’ improbable and tenacious season came to a close with the star-laden Steelers rolling to a 30-12 wild-card round victory that was never in doubt.There were few surprises in the game plan, as the Steelers employed their tried-and-true approach to offense, with Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell collecting two touchdowns each.Initially, Ben Roethlisberger deftly used Bell and his various other receiver options to soften up the Miami defense just enough to create openings for Brown, who used his catch-and-run ability to race for touchdowns of 50 and 62 yards.With a lead opened up, and all eyes on Brown, the Steelers turned to Bell, who in his first career playoff game rushed for a franchise-record 167 yards. He topped the previous mark of 158, set by Franco Harris in Super Bowl IX.The Steelers amassed 367 yards on 54 plays, with Roethlisberger completing 13 of 18 passes for 197 yards, letting Brown and Bell essentially steal the show.The offensive output, combined with a turn-back-the clock game by the team’s defense, overwhelmed the Dolphins, who had survived losing the team’s starters and quarterback and running back during the season to finish with a surprisingly good 10-6 record and the No. 6 seed in the A.F.C. playoffs.The Dolphins endured a scare at the end of the first half when Matt Moore, who took over the starting quarterback position when Ryan Tannehill was injured in Week 14, took a brutal helmet-to-helmet hit from Steelers linebacker Bud Dupree, and was forced to leave the game. Moore cleared the N.F.L.’s concussion protocol and returned one play later, but it was just one of several big hits he took during the game, including sacks by James Harrison and Mike Mitchell, both of which resulted in fumbles recovered by Pittsburgh.Moore ended up completing 29 of 36 passes for 289 yards. He was sacked five times, fumbled twice and threw one interception.The game was a far cry from Miami’s 30-15 upset of Pittsburgh in Week 6 that started a four-game losing streak for the Steelers. In that game, Jay Ajayi made a name for himself with 204 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns, but in the rematch Bell outgained his Dolphins’ counterpart in rushing yards 167 to 33, with Ajayi exiting late in the game with a shoulder injury.With the win, Pittsburgh will now travel to Kansas City to face the Chiefs in the divisional round, and the Houston Texans will travel to New England to face the Patriots.■ The Houston Texans rolled past the Oakland Raiders, in a 27-14 game that was never in doubt. Brock Osweiler deserved some praise after his re-emergence, but the lopsided score had just as much to do with Connor Cook’s inability to overcome his lack of experience. The rookie, making his first career start, attempted a remarkable 45 passes and only completed 18, though the number climbs to 21 if you count his three interceptions. Cook got no help from Michael Crabtree and Amari Cooper. He targeted the standout wide receivers 17 times and they came away with just 4 receptions. The Texans are still waiting for the Steelers-Dolphins result to find out their opponent in the divisional round.■ The Seattle Seahawks located the team’s missing running game just in time for the playoffs, and Thomas Rawls steamrolled the Detroit Lions with 161 yards on 27 carries. Rawls’s performance may not have had the highlight reel aspect of Marshawn Lynch’s Beast Mode days, but it set a franchise record for rushing yards in a playoff game. Rawls, despite limited playing time over two seasons, now has three of the top-20 rushing performances in Seahawks history. Lynch’s best game is ranked 21st. Seattle’s defense also looked playoff-ready, smothering the high-powered Lions in a 26-6 laugher. The Seahawks will face Atlanta in the divisional round."
How Clemson Can Beat Alabama (Praying Is Optional),"TAMPA, Fla. — If a football team averaged barely one touchdown per game, you would call it a pretty bad team.But what if that was just by its defense and punt returners? You would call it a championship contender — or the 2016 Alabama Crimson Tide.Alabama’s defense and special teams have been light-years beyond anyone else’s, conceding only one more touchdown to opposing offenses than they have scored themselves. In 14 games this season, the Tide have 15 touchdowns from interception returns, fumble returns and punt returns — in other words, on 15 occasions, Alabama has scored a touchdown when its offense was not on the field.“I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Clemson Coach Dabo Swinney, whose Tigers face Alabama (14-0) on Monday night in the College Football Playoff championship game. “They’ve got 15. They’ve created a word, they’ve done it so much — NOTs.” He used an acronym for nonoffensive touchdowns.There have been six touchdowns on interceptions, five on fumbles and four on punts. Da’Ron Payne returned a fumble for a score against Mississippi, which was among the teams that ceded the fewest fumbles this season in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Eddie Jackson, who later sustained a season-ending injury, returned a punt 79 yards against Tennessee — the only punt-return touchdown the Volunteers allowed this season. Ryan Anderson intercepted Washington’s Jake Browning on Dec. 31 for that star quarterback’s only pick returned for a score this season.So it was no wonder that when Swinney was asked on Saturday how to beat Alabama — he has come as close as anybody recently, falling in last year’s title game, 45-40, thanks in part to a 95-yard kickoff return by Alabama — that he knew the first order of business: “You can’t let them score on defense or special teams.”The question of how to beat Alabama is the default one as Monday night approaches, simply because the Tide, who are going for their fifth title in eight seasons, have lost just one game in the past two seasons. Victory would give them a 27-game winning streak, the 10th longest since World War II, with no obvious end in sight.But there just may be a playbook.“Clemson might be the only team in college football that can beat Alabama,” said the CBS college football commentator Gary Danielson. (“I don’t think they will,” he added.)A Clemson win would almost certainly begin with a positive turnover margin. In Alabama’s one loss this season or last, a fluky 43-37 defeat by Ole Miss in September 2015, the Rebels benefited from five turnovers and gave up none of their own. And there would be no nonoffensive touchdowns — no NOTs.“You cannot allow that to happen,” said the new Purdue coach Jeff Brohm, whose Western Kentucky team lost to Alabama this season, 38-10, giving up a 55-yard touchdown off an interception. “When it does, you’re behind the eight ball.”Second, Clemson (13-1), probably the only team that resembles Alabama in both talent and depth on its offensive and defensive lines, needs to win at the line of scrimmage — or, failing that, play Alabama to a draw.“We need to play well up front, and we need to limit the explosive plays,” said Brent Venables, Clemson’s defensive coordinator.The alternative, the Clemson quarterbacks coach Brandon Streeter suggested, is to treat Alabama as the Germans did France’s imposing Maginot Line during World War II — by going around it. They could try to get the ball to the perimeter, or at least make it look as if that is where the ball is going, rather than try to break through a front seven that has held opposing teams to 62 rushing yards per game — more than 35 fewer than the second-best team in the F.B.S.“Misdirection,” Streeter said. “Sometimes it looks like we’re going east and west, but maybe those are just motions or speed motions that makes it look like it, and then we’re getting up the middle.”Clemson’s offensive backfield is usually a hive of activity before the snap, with motions and shifts that may or may not lead to handoffs, swing passes or designed runs for quarterback Deshaun Watson, the dangerously mobile two-time Heisman Trophy finalist.“Our offensive line has done a great job this year of handling our base plays,” Streeter added. “What we can do to help them is make it look a little different, so it’s not just ‘Here’s the formation,’ and they can line up to it and attack it the way they’ve seen it on film.”Clemson’s offense is dynamic. Several of its skill players seem bound for the N.F.L., and Watson, gifted though he is as a runner, is actually a greater threat throwing the ball. And so Brohm, who played quarterback for six N.F.L. teams, had two words of advice for the Tigers: Go deep.Even though the Crimson Tide excel most at defending the run, they usually line up to defend the pass with two safeties and cornerbacks who slow receivers getting off the line. Shorter completions, Brohm suggested, might be more trouble than they are worth.“We tried to throw it over their heads,” Brohm said. “We didn’t hit one.”Danielson concurred.“They’re going to challenge you to throw the ball,” he said.That could be a winning strategy, he added, noting the physical similarity between Clemson’s star wide receiver, Mike Williams, who missed last year’s title game with an injury, and Dallas Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant.“Mike Williams has one of those Dez Bryant-type bodies that, in one-on-one coverages, is good for throwing the ball,” Danielson said.Against Alabama’s offense, Clemson will hope to get to Jalen Hurts, the Tide’s true freshman quarterback, who completed just seven passes for 57 yards in the semifinal against Washington.Clemson’s coaches and players shied away on Saturday from anything more than euphemistic acknowledgments of Hurts’s limitations — “The surrounding, supporting cast really helped Jalen Hurts have the kind of year that he has,” Venables said — perhaps fearful of doling out bulletin-board material. However, working in-game for the first time with the new Crimson Tide offensive coordinator, Steve Sarkisian, Hurts is the clear weak link in an offense otherwise filled with stars.Alabama’s game plans “protected the quarterback,” Danielson said, “not making him make throwing decisions.”So, Clemson’s recipe: Commit no turnovers (even as Watson’s 17 interceptions stick out like a bad bruise); overwhelm the defense (which gave up 11.2 points per game); throw the deep ball (past defensive backs who are likely to end up in the N.F.L.); and frustrate a composed young quarterback (who actually threw fewer interceptions per attempt this season than Watson).And Swinney had one more idea for how to accomplish the task in front of him: “We’ve got to find a way to get a couple of them NOTs.”"
Steelers Crush Dolphins to Set Up a Clash With the Chiefs,"PITTSBURGH — The Miami Dolphins won the coin toss Sunday and kicked off to the Pittsburgh Steelers, a decision that in retrospect seemed a tad misguided. But then it was not as if electing to receive would have been a wiser choice.A more prudent, if somewhat unorthodox, strategy would have been doing something else entirely with the football. Hiding it, for example. Maybe beneath the Dolphins’ parkas.Because without the ball, the Steelers’ offense could not score.And if the Steelers’ offense could not score, then the Dolphins might actually have stood a chance of winning Sunday’s playoff game at Heinz Field instead of absorbing a comprehensive demolition. The 30-12 defeat, which reaffirmed Pittsburgh as a formidable A.F.C. contender, held less suspense than a romantic comedy.All of 2 minutes 45 seconds elapsed before Pittsburgh scored on an exquisite catch-and-run (50 yards) by Antonio Brown. That preceded another exquisite catch-and-run by Brown (62 yards), which preceded a scoring rush by Le’Veon Bell, who accounted for all 78 yards on that drive (excluding a 5-yard penalty), all on runs, 10 in a row. It was as if the Steelers kept giving him the ball because they had grown bored of demoralizing Miami through the air.Finishing with 167 yards, Bell set the team single-game postseason record in his playoff debut. He missed the playoffs two seasons ago with a hyperextended knee. Last year, a torn knee ligament sidelined him.The Steelers have been eagerly waiting for their redoubtable trio of Bell, Brown and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who completed his first 11 passes for 188 yards, to play in the postseason together. They combined for all four touchdowns, scored across the first seven series (one was a kneel-down before halftime), in a performance that showcased Pittsburgh at the apex of its intimidating might.“We can attack in different ways,” Bell said.All of them are devastating. Especially those that involve Brown, who turned two short passes into long touchdowns, and Bell. Not since Barry Sanders, perhaps, has the N.F.L. seen a running back as destructively patient as Bell. He takes the handoff.Then he waits.“I’m standing back there and I’m watching, and I’m like, ‘Uh, are you going to go any time here?’” Roethlisberger said of Bell.The length of Bell’s pause varies from play to play, but it allows him to survey the field, set up his blockers and find creases. Accelerating through, he leaves defenders in his wake, then drags them through it.“He’s a man for all situations or circumstances,” Coach Mike Tomlin said.When Miami’s defensive coordinator, Vance Joseph, was asked last week how he prioritized containing Brown, Bell and Roethlisberger, he chose Bell first.“If you can’t contain Bell, you can’t contain A. B.,” Joseph said, using Brown’s nickname.The Dolphins, overwhelmed by the challenge, did neither. The burden of preparing for the Steelers now belongs to the Kansas City Chiefs, who will host Pittsburgh on Sunday afternoon in a rematch of a Week 4 game. The Steelers won by 29 points that night, but there is folly in perceiving past as prologue.The Dolphins’ resurfacing in the postseason after an eight-year absence elicited much joy not only in South Florida, but also in western Pennsylvania, where the Steelers seethed all week, eager to avenge an October rout. That win ignited Miami’s recovery from a 1-4 start and foretold the steamrollering that running back Jay Ajayi, who rushed for 204 yards that day, would administer to defensive game plans. Even thinking about that defeat angered the Steelers’ defensive coordinator, Keith Butler, who said it “really challenges your manhood.”The Steelers pride themselves on playing a physical style. Shoved around that day, they vowed to inflict pain Sunday.“We just wanted to get out there and be as physical and as violent as we could be,” safety Mike Mitchell said. “Like I said, our mind-set was to tee off on them. It wasn’t to wrap up and make tackles.”Ajayi exceeded 200 yards twice more during the regular season. He never came close Sunday, smothered by Pittsburgh’s front. He finished with 33 yards on 16 carries.“We always can get better, but we was cooking today,” defensive end Stephon Tuitt said. “It was fun to cook.”The essence of Mitchell’s proclamation — “The goal was to tee off on them; I can’t say that enough” — permeated the rest of the defense, which nearly turned Miami’s suboptimal quarterback situation even more dire midway through the second quarter.Starting a fourth consecutive week in place of the injured Ryan Tannehill (knee), Matt Moore left the pocket and, after releasing a pass, encountered linebacker Bud Dupree. He did not hit Moore so much as nearly dislodge Moore’s head from his body.“You just see a sack,” said Dupree, who had not yet seen a replay.Moore crumpled to the field and lay there as a skirmish that began near the Miami sideline expanded closer to midfield. It seemed to take less time for Moore to be examined for a concussion, and other injuries, than he spent on the ground. He missed one play.“I got checked out, I felt fine,” Moore said. “It was more of my jaw than anything else. I felt good. I came back in, and I was fine.”On that drive, the Dolphins kicked a field goal to draw to within 20-6. But on their next two series, on either side of halftime, Moore was strip-sacked, losing the ball — and, soon enough, the game for the Dolphins.Pittsburgh, which has won eight straight, has not lost since Nov. 13, when Dallas pilfered a late victory that earned the wrath of Roethlisberger, who demanded afterward that the Steelers play with more discipline and accountability. Those elements returned, and so did the A.F.C. North crown, borrowed for a year by Cincinnati.The Steelers reached this stage of the playoffs last season before losing at Denver. They did not have Bell, or even Brown, who sat with a concussion.Now they have both. And Roethlisberger, who said he would play next week despite an injured ankle encased afterward in a walking boot. And a healthy offensive line. And a snarling defense.But still.“I’m not excited about this,” guard Ramon Foster said after the win.Why?“It’s bigger than this week,” he added, referring to the coming game against the Chiefs."
Purdue Ends Wisconsin’s Nine-Game Streak,"Caleb Swanigan had 18 points and 13 rebounds on Sunday to help No. 20 Purdue win at home over No. 13 Wisconsin, 66-55, and end the Badgers’ nine-game winning streak.The Boilermakers (14-3, 3-1 Big Ten) have won nine of 10 over all and three straight against the Badgers.Ethan Happ had 17 points and Nigel Hayes had 10 for the Badgers (13-3, 2-1).Wisconsin trailed, 40-36, with 14 minutes 35 seconds to go when D’Mitrik Trice missed an open layup. The Boilermakers responded with a 12-0 run and led by at least 11 the rest of the way.MISSISSIPPI STATE BEATS LADY VOLS Blair Schaefer made a go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:39 left as No. 4 Mississippi State capitalized on its superior depth to win, 74-64, at Tennessee (10-5, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) and stay undefeated. Mississippi State (17-0, 3-0) is one of only three remaining unbeaten Division I women’s teams, along with No. 1 Connecticut and No. 18 Virginia Tech.Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria ended a long wait between ATP titles, beating third-seeded Kei Nishikori, 6-2, 2-6, 6-3, to win the final of the Brisbane International in Australia and claim his first tournament victory since 2014. Dimitrov lost the Brisbane International final to Andy Murray in 2013. He won three titles in 2014 and reached the Wimbledon semifinals as he rose to a career-high ranking of No. 8.Not even a broken gate rolling down the course could stop the Olympic slalom champion Mikaela Shiffrin from winning a women’s World Cup race in Maribor, Slovenia. In light snowfall, she was leading the field by 0.19 of a second when a gate that she had just passed correctly broke and flew down the hill. Shiffrin skied over it but managed to stay on the course. She fell 0.09 of a second off the lead but accelerated in the bottom section to take the win, 0.19 of a second ahead of Wendy Holdener of Switzerland.Joel Embiid scored 20 points, and the Philadelphia 76ers earned their 10th victory, matching their total from last season and beating the host Nets, 105-95. The 76ers broke it open with a 17-2 surge in the fourth quarter to win the matchup between the N.B.A.’s two worst teams. Brook Lopez scored 26 points for the Nets, who have lost six in a row.Chelsea cruised into the fourth round of the F.A. Cup with a 4-1 victory at home over Peterborough United, even though the team’s captain, John Terry, received a red card. Terry, who was handed a rare start, was given the red card for a foul on Lee Angol, but Chelsea progressed thanks to two goals by Pedro and goals from Michy Batshuayi and Willian.Tottenham Hotspur joined Chelsea in the fourth round by winning at home over Aston Villa, 2-0, but Liverpool faces a replay at fourth-tier Plymouth Argyle after a lineup of second-stringers was held to a 0-0 draw at Anfield.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSEMESSI RESCUES BARCELONA Lionel Messi saved Barcelona from its second straight defeat by scoring on a 90th-minute free kick in a 1-1 draw at Villarreal in the Spanish league. Three days after losing to Athletic Bilbao, 2-1, in a first-leg match in the Copa del Rey, Barcelona had failed to score until Messi produced a superb strike from the edge of the penalty area.In a surprise move, California fired Coach Sonny Dykes after four seasons that produced just one bowl appearance. Dykes finished his tenure with a 19-30 record, including 10-26 in the Pacific-12. The offensive coordinator Jake Spavital will serve as interim coach.Justin Thomas of the United States bounced back at just the right time to hold off Hideki Matsuyama of Japan and win the SBS Tournament of Champions in Kapalua, Hawaii. Thomas closed with a four-under-par 69 and ended Matsuyama’s bid for a fourth straight victory."
Seeing the Upside as FIFA Votes on Expanding the World Cup,"FIFA has been here before. Accused of trying to fix something that is not broken, criticized for abandoning the tried and tested for the unwieldy and unwanted, told it is sacrificing quality for quantity, warned that it is greed that tends to kill off the goose that lays the golden eggs.More than once, in fact: In the late 1970s, when its upstart new president, João Havelange, vowed to end Europe’s hegemony on World Cup places and include more teams from Africa and Asia. In the 1990s, when he repeated the trick, expanding the tournament from 24 to an apparently cumbersome 32.Both decisions were met with acrimony from those — primarily in Western Europe — who saw their privileged position under threat. The tournament’s appeal was predicated on its air of exclusivity, FIFA was told. The new inclusions would not be up to scratch. The competition would lose its luster, and with it would go the fans.Ever since Gianni Infantino, FIFA’s current president, in October raised the specter of another expansion, in 2026 — to 48 teams from the current 32 — the complaints have been the same. His air of quiet confidence ever since suggests he knows what the outcome will be, too. The World Cup’s history is littered with spurts of growth. What is expected to happen when FIFA’s governing council meets in Zurich on Tuesday simply will be the latest.As a rule of thumb, with anything FIFA does, it is wise to locate the self-interest and work backward from there. Such is the price the organization pays for decades of boiler-room horse-trading, of cash-filled envelopes and thinly veiled nepotism, followed by years of dawn raids and arrest warrants and corruption charges. Few are predisposed to believe it is capable of acting, as the slogan goes, for the good of the game.In this case, it would be relatively easy, too. The prime beneficiary of Infantino’s plan would appear to be Infantino himself: Expanding the World Cup, particularly to benefit the countries of Africa and Asia and the Caribbean, is an act of patronage straight from the playbook written by Havelange and perfected by Sepp Blatter, whom Infantino succeeded. It would place much of soccer’s developing world in Infantino’s debt, cementing his position and securing a power base.Infantino is not the only one, however, who would do well from an expansion. FIFA sent a 65-page document to its council members in recent weeks, analyzing five possible options for future World Cups: the current 32-team format; a 40-team competition consisting of eight groups of five or 10 groups of four; a 48-team tournament with a play-in round before a 32-team group stage; and a 48-team tournament with 16 groups of three teams and an extra knockout stage.Though the document explicitly stated that FIFA must make a decision purely for “sporting” reasons, rather than commercial ones, it is hard to believe it is a coincidence that the most likely model to be adopted — with 16 groups of three — is also the one that is projected to swell FIFA’s coffers by as much as a billion dollars.That is an extra billion dollars that could be rerouted to confederations, and on to member nations, across the world. It is money that would be used, in theory, to bolster infrastructure and improve facilities, to spread a little of the wealth generated by the world’s biggest sporting event to every corner of the globe. That is, after all, how all FIFA money is spent, in theory.And yet that does not adequately explain Infantino’s confidence. He has heard the usual rumblings of discontent from the European Club Association, the body that looks after the interests of the biggest professional teams in Europe, and even from Germany’s soccer association, the DFB, suggesting that there are considerable problems with all of the proposed models, and he has batted them all away.“There are only upsides,” Infantino said last year — implying that he is not only sure he has the support, but that he is in the right, too.In his technical report from the 1966 World Cup — one of the old-style tournaments: 16 teams, dominated by Europe and South America, with just one team from Asia and, after a boycott, none from Africa — Switzerland’s coach, Alfredo Foni, wrote that the tournament “will have attained its aim only when the five continents are effectively represented, football being the most universal of sports.”That is what the alterations of the last 40 years have aimed to do: address the longstanding imbalance between soccer’s traditional powers and its emerging nations. It is — whether for the right or the wrong reasons — what Infantino’s measures are intended to build on.There are 54 member nations of UEFA, Europe’s confederation. Thirteen of them, as well as Russia, as host, will qualify for the 2018 World Cup. There are 56 member nations of CAF, the African governing body. There are only five spaces available to them. Asia’s 47 national federations have only four guaranteed spots, as many as are allocated to South America, which boasts only 10 members.Though the concentration of quality in Europe and South America is unquestionably far higher, the idea that the World Cup should be only for the very best teams is one that has traction only in isolated spots. Elsewhere, it seems elitist; exclusive in its most pejorative sense.It is hard to argue that either Africa or Asia is “effectively represented” at the World Cup. The tournament, in its current guise, struggles — in Foni’s words — to “attain its aim” of showcasing a universal sport.That is not to say that there are not problems with Infantino’s preferred option. The qualification process in Europe and South America, certainly, would be stripped of what little drama it currently has, though many might observe that that is no great loss. FIFA itself has acknowledged that having an odd number of teams in each group is less than ideal; the suggestion that tied games in the group stages might be settled by penalty shootouts is anathema to most fans.And by abolishing simultaneous kickoff times, the risk of corruption in the final group games is undeniably increased. It does feel messy and drawn out compared with the neatness of the current tournament format.But it is telling that even in those places where any move from FIFA is greeted with the most intense suspicion, there is a degree of acceptance. UEFA’s delegates to the FIFA council met Monday morning, intending to settle on a joint plan of action. They do not, though, oppose expansion on principle. If anything, it is in the interests of the established powers in every confederation: It makes it all but impossible for them to miss out.The fine detail, of course, will be harder to iron out. One proposed model would see Europe given 16 guaranteed spaces, Africa nine, Asia eight, North America and South America six apiece and Oceania one, with two others decided through intercontinental playoffs. Like UEFA, most confederations are planning to wait until they see exactly what is in it for them before giving their wholehearted approval.There is, though, a consensus that the time has come for another change, that the World Cup must start to reflect the world — both real and sporting — of the 21st century, not that of the late 20th. That is what the World Cup does: It expands and grows and blossoms and becomes something else. The World Cup has not existed as it is forever; nor should it expect to. There is nothing wrong with the current format. But sometimes, hard as it is to admit, FIFA is right to change."
Hall of Fame Odds Slip for Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens,"The chances that Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens will soon be inducted into baseball’s Hall of Fame have diminished somewhat in recent days as more writers have disclosed how they voted on the 2017 ballot.As of Monday afternoon, 184 votes had been made public on the Hall of Fame vote-tracking site operated by Ryan Thibodaux. With candidates needing to be named on 75 percent of ballots cast to win induction into the Hall, Bonds stood at 65.2 percent and Clemens at 64.7. The official, final vote totals, which will most likely exceed 400 ballots, will be announced on Jan. 18.Just a week ago, with nearly 160 votes made public, Bonds and Clemens each stood at 70.3 percent, close enough to reach out and touch a Cooperstown plaque. But based on patterns in previous votes, there was a distinct possibility that the numbers for Bonds and Clemens would start to slip a bit. And they have.Still, if Clemens, Bonds or both ended up with more than 60 percent of the final vote — and there is still a good chance of that happening — it would represent a big jump from their support in the 2016 vote, when Clemens was named on 45.2 percent of the ballots and Bonds on 44.3.And with five more years of eligibility on the ballot, Bonds and Clemens would have a shot to build on that momentum, as others have in the past, and actually gain entry into Cooperstown despite their well-known links to performance-enhancing drugs.On the newly disclosed ballots, no voters flipped their support to Bonds or Clemens. Voters can include as many as 10 former players on their ballot, and as of last week, 21 voters who had previously declined to support Bonds supported him this time. Twenty-two writers did the same for Clemens.For now, at least, Bonds and Clemens remain stuck on those numbers.Some of those who have changed their minds and decided to support Bonds and Clemens have cited Bud Selig’s recent induction into the Hall of Fame by a veterans committee, which is separate from the writers who vote. Selig was baseball’s commissioner for nearly a quarter of a century, including the period in which the use of steroids and other performance enhancers flourished.Although Selig eventually led a crackdown on such substances and made baseball more aggressive than other sports in policing them, he has repeatedly been criticized for not getting baseball to act sooner.And in the minds of some writers, that failure is not appreciably worse than the fact that Bonds and Clemens were so prominently linked to performance-enhancing drugs. If Selig is in the Hall of Fame, they reason, then Bonds and Clemens should be, too.Based on the current results of the Hall of Fame tracker, both Jeff Bagwell and Tim Raines are in strong position to be inducted when the final vote totals are revealed. Each continues to be named on 90 percent of the ballots made public so far. Raines is in his 10th and final year on the ballot. Bagwell is in his seventh."
"Ryan Moore, Ryder Cup Standout, Finally Makes Most of His Promise","KAPALUA, Hawaii — When Ryan Moore defeated Lee Westwood to earn the clinching point for the United States in its victory over Europe at the Ryder Cup in October, the last thing on Moore’s mind was his golf ball.It was sitting inches from the hole after his short putt had been conceded as cameramen, teammates, friends and family streamed onto the 18th green at Minnesota’s Hazeltine National Golf Club to congratulate Moore, the final man chosen for the team by its captain, Davis Love III.More than two decades earlier, Love made the winning putt to secure the 1993 Ryder Cup for the Americans at the Belfry in England. Lost in the celebration, he forgot to pick up his ball, and to this day, he does not know what happened to it.With that memory in his mind, Love picked up Moore’s ball and said, “You’re going to want this.” Later that night, Moore gave the ball back to Love as a show of appreciation.“He’s the only reason I was on the team in the first place,” Moore said last week at the winners-only Tournament of Champions in Maui, where the PGA Tour resumed its 2016-17 season after a six-week break. “The fact that this was his team and his doing, I wanted him to have the clinching ball.”The moment was poignant for both men, but it was also telling. Long thought of as a lone wolf because he is quiet and often keeps to himself at tournaments, Moore cut a likable figure on an American team of big personalities. And in his push to make the team, and his success at the event, he has also proved capable of handling a big stage and fulfilling the potential he showed as a ballyhooed amateur more than a decade ago.Last season, Moore, now 34, had his best year to date on the tour, racking up nine top-10 finishes, including a win, a second place and a third place on his way to a career-best $3.7 million in earnings. His four-hole sudden-death playoff loss to Rory McIlroy at the season-ending Tour Championship in September sealed Moore’s selection to the Ryder Cup team.One week into 2017, Moore has continued his fine form, finishing tied for third in Maui against an elite group of 31 other winners from last year.Getting to this point, though, took longer than expected.When he turned professional in 2005, Moore was the most decorated amateur since Tiger Woods after having won the 2004 N.C.A.A. individual title during his junior year at Nevada-Las Vegas, and the United States Amateur, the Western Amateur and the United States Public Links that summer. Playing on sponsors’ exemptions, he earned enough money to become the first player since Woods in 1996 to go directly from college to the tour in the same season, without having to go to qualifying school.But the following year, Moore had surgery on his left wrist and missed two months. The injury continued to linger, and other maladies soon cropped up, including problems with his shoulder and left ankle. They led him to alter his swing and change his mentality.“Golf is so much about confidence; it’s hard when you’re injured and it’s hard to gain and keep confidence,” Moore said. “I had to manage my expectations a little bit. It became ‘Let’s keep my job, not try to win four times a year.’“It’s hard going from the amount of success I had for that long to losing it, losing that feel and that confidence and hitting the ball where I want to hit it and pick a course apart, to feeling like I was just trying to avoid trouble. You have to find confidence other ways.”An impressive ball-striker before the injuries, Moore got by with a strong short game, collecting five wins between 2009 and 2016. But it was not until more recently that he elevated his commitment and, consequently, his play.Jeremy Moore, one of Moore’s three siblings and also his manager, said Ryan had not approached golf like a career until the past five years.“Something clicked,” Jeremy Moore said. “He realized these guys are really good, and if he wanted to reach his potential, he had to make some changes.”Among them were his coach (Troy Denton, a former roommate from college), his caddie (J. J. Jakovac) and his trainer (Brian Chandler), who was added last year. Moore also stopped tinkering with, and changing, equipment, something he had done often throughout his decade on the tour.When asked about the biggest difference in Moore these days, Jakovac, who has been with Moore for five years, said: “Sticking to a plan. He can get sidetracked pretty easily, but I’ve never seen him not tinker with clubs so much over the last year.”Still, there was plenty of doubt about whether Love would use one of his four captain’s picks on Moore. Once on the team, though, Moore fit right in.“I remember him standing up telling everyone how thankful he was that we had trust in him, and just saying he’s going to put his heart on the line,” Jordan Spieth said.Moore went 2-1 for the week in what ended up being a 6-point victory for the Americans.“I think it was a great team for him because he doesn’t have a ton of super-close friends, but when you get to know him, he’s a cool, laid-back guy,” Jakovac said. “He was a good addition to that team, too, because they already had their strong voices.”It also changed Moore’s perspective on the Ryder Cup after he had been passed over so many times before, including 2014, when he was left off despite just missing an automatic spot.“I appreciate it more,” he said.Love has plenty of appreciation for Moore — not just for helping the United States win the Ryder Cup, but for the gesture of giving the ball back to him.“It meant a lot to me,” said Love, who has the ball at home on his dresser until he finds a more permanent place for it. “It meant a lot to me the way the whole thing happened. Getting to call him to tell him he was in was one of the highlights of my career.“What Ryan did was the reason we were a team. I was looking out for Ryan, and Ryan was looking out for me.”"
"National Antidoping Groups, Citing Doping, Want Russian Athletes Barred","National antidoping organizations from 19 countries have again called for severe sanctions against Russia for its doping offenses, saying its athletes should be barred from all international competitions until it complies with antidoping rules.The national antidoping groups have limited, if any, authority to discipline athletes; most of the sports bodies that wield such authority — including the International Olympic Committee — have been disinclined to levy such drastic punishments. The International Paralympic Committee and global track and field officials, however, have barred Russia’s entire delegations.Antidoping officials met in Dublin this week, a month after the release of a report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency that showed how Russian officials orchestrated a vast doping program at the Olympics and other competitions that involved or benefited 1,000 athletes in 30 sports.In a statement from their conference, the antidoping officials called their proposals an urgent response to “the devastating evidence of widespread systemic corruption exposed by the second McLaren report” — a reference to the WADA-commissioned report, produced by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.The antidoping officials also called for the removal of all international competitions from Russia and a moratorium on the scheduling of new competitions there. Russia is preparing to host in 2018 the world’s biggest sports competition, the World Cup, organized by FIFA, soccer’s governing body.The McLaren report described a doping program coordinated by Russia’s sports ministry that corrupted the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the 2013 track and field world championships in Moscow and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, among other events.After months of emphatic denials about the doping accusations, Russian officials told The New York Times in interviews last month in Moscow that they were no longer disputing that the doping scheme existed. Their only remaining objection, they said, was to any suggestion that President Vladimir V. Putin and his closest associates were involved.Outside the Olympics, the international governing bodies for individual sports have autonomy over disciplining athletes for violations like doping. Thomas Bach, the president of the I.O.C., decided against a blanket ban for Russian athletes at last summer’s Rio Games, instead reversing the presumption of innocence for Russian athletes and deferring to the sports federations to reinstate individual athletes."
Jorge Posada in Danger of Falling Off Hall of Fame Ballot,"In the center of a sun-filled atrium, at the far end of the plaque gallery at the Baseball Hall of Fame, you will meet the first class of inductees from 1936. Only five players made it then: Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, Christy Mathewson, Babe Ruth and Honus Wagner. Even Cy Young, with his 511 career wins, had to wait.In the eight decades since, only 46 more players have been elected by the writers on the first try. Those inductees are mixed with all the rest, along the side walls. They are immortals in equal standing because not every Hall of Famer is obvious at first. In a sometimes clunky election process, most candidates need years to build a case.Jorge Posada’s might be over just as it starts. In his first appearance on the ballot, Posada, the stalwart catcher of the Yankees’ recent glory years, is in danger of falling off without future consideration. Posada has been named on just eight of the 190 ballots made public so far, as compiled by Ryan Thibodaux. That comes to 4.2 percent, just shy of the 5 percent he will need to survive for another year. Results will be announced next Wednesday.“I hope Jorge hangs in for a while,” said Mark Newman, a former Yankees senior vice president. “Maybe he’ll be an acquired taste.”Posada made his first professional stop in Oneonta, N.Y., in the shadow of Cooperstown, in 1991. He had been drafted as a middle infielder the previous summer, in the 24th round, from Calhoun Community College in Alabama. The Oneonta manager, Jack Gillis, thought he profiled better as a catcher.“The first practice day, we were working in the bullpen on catching,” said Newman, then the Yankees’ coordinator of instruction. “Jorge had a great arm stroke and perfect spin on the baseball — that 12-6 rotation — and his hands were good because he was an infielder. He was a below-average runner, but he had a plus arm, his feet were pretty good, and he was a switch-hitter with potential for power.”By the end of the decade, Posada had teamed with Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams as homegrown cornerstones of a championship lineup. At the same spots where the Yankees once had Yogi Berra, Phil Rizzuto and Mickey Mantle, they had Posada, Jeter and Williams. Both groups wound up with a dazzling collection of rings.“When you look at those guys’ offensive production relative to their positions,” Newman said, “that was a huge, huge factor for us in building great offensive teams.”Jeter was the captain, and Williams had seniority. But inside the clubhouse, Posada held major influence. The Yankees reached the postseason in every year of his career except 2008, when he was down with a shoulder injury.“The biggest thing for me was his leadership in the clubhouse and with the pitching staff,” said John Flaherty, who backed up Posada from 2003 to 2005. “There was a toughness about him. He wasn’t afraid to get in your face if he saw something he didn’t like. He kind of set the tone the years I was there. The other guys got a lot of the credit, but in that clubhouse, you knew who the leaders were.”Another ballot newcomer, Jason Varitek, filled the same role in the same seasons for the Boston Red Sox. But Posada far outranks Varitek offensively, and Posada’s case rests mainly on the rarity of such thump from a longtime catcher.Posada had a .374 career on-base percentage and a .474 slugging percentage, for an O.P.S. of .848. Among catchers with at least 1,000 career games, just five have a higher O.P.S.: Mike Piazza, Mickey Cochrane, Bill Dickey, Roy Campanella and Gabby Hartnett. All are in the Hall of Fame.This is not to say that Posada should be there, too. But it should make voters think hard about his worthiness. Players must be retired for five years before they appear on a ballot, and maybe that is enough time to ponder a candidate. The problem is the process.The Hall of Fame limits voters to a maximum of 10 selections, even if voters think more than 10 candidates are worthy. The writers have asked the Hall of Fame to raise or eliminate that arbitrary limit, with no success.It is hard to consider Posada one of the 10 best candidates in the current, crowded field — and despite his high on-base percentage, advanced metrics do not work in his favor. He collected just 42.7 wins above replacement, by the calculation of Baseball-Reference.com, placing him below J. D. Drew, Mike Cameron and 15 others on this ballot.The metrics dock Posada for his defense; he never won a Gold Glove and twice led the majors in passed balls. But he was the primary catcher for four World Series winners, which should count for something. Some starters preferred other catchers, but if Posada’s defense truly hurt the Yankees, it was hard to tell.He honored the position and its legacy at Yankee Stadium, drawing inspiration from Thurman Munson. He inspired Munson’s widow, Diana, to follow baseball again, many long and painful years after her husband’s fatal plane crash in 1979.“I started getting the fever back, and he’s the one that inspired that,” she said in 2015, after the Yankees retired Posada’s No. 20. “I think he and Thurman would have been great buds. They have that same kind of grittiness that I love, yet that gentle side that nobody knows about.”Munson won a Most Valuable Player Award, made seven All-Star teams, excelled in the postseason and was captain of the Yankees, a powerful impact in just 11 seasons. Yet he reached just 15.5 percent of the vote in his first year on the ballot, which turned out to be his peak. Munson lingered on the ballot for 15 years, then the maximum the Hall allowed, without ever again reaching 10 percent. A later Yankees captain, Don Mattingly, also lasted 15 years but peaked at 28.2 percent.Some fans and reporters cite bias in favor of New York stars, but those examples easily debunk that myth. Gil Hodges peaked below two-thirds of the vote, Roger Maris below one-third. And none of these New York stars ever reached even 12 percent: David Cone (peaked at 3.9), Ron Guidry (8.8), Keith Hernandez (10.8), Jerry Koosman (0.9), Graig Nettles (8.3) and Williams (9.6).Hernandez and Guidry spent nine years on the ballot before dropping off, Nettles four, Williams two, Cone and Koosman one. Other stars with less time in New York also disappeared after just one appearance, including Kevin Brown, Kenny Lofton and the highly underrated John Olerud.Perhaps Posada belongs in that group, the so-called Hall of Very Good. But just 17 catchers are enshrined, the fewest for any defensive position besides third base, which has 16 alumni in Cooperstown. Even if Ivan Rodriguez makes it this time, on his first try, catchers are still underrepresented.The job description is to squat for nine innings, block errant pitches, absorb foul tips, prepare game plans, guide a pitching staff — and still find a way to hit. Yet voters award no extra points, it seems, for degree of difficulty.For Posada, there was an added expectation: win every year. He handled the demands better than almost any other catcher ever has. He might not have done enough to pave a path to Cooperstown, but he deserves more time on the road."
Baylor Falls Flat in Its First Game as No. 1,"Nathan Adrian broke out of a shooting slump with a career-high 22 points, and No. 10 West Virginia beat No. 1 Baylor, 89-68, on Tuesday night in the Bears’ first game in program history as the top-ranked team.Baylor (15-1, 3-1 Big 12) committed a season-high 29 turnovers and never led in its second true road game of the season. West Virginia (14-2, 3-1) started the second half with an 11-3 run and at one point led by 26.KANSAS 81, OKLAHOMA 70 Frank Mason scored 19 of his 28 points in the second half, and No. 2 Kansas rallied to beat host Oklahoma.

She was recruited out of Lawrence North High School in Indianapolis and averaged 3.6 points in 11 games this season.Dennis Schroder had 19 points and 10 assists, Dwight Howard added 14 points and 16 rebounds, and the Atlanta Hawks won their season-high seventh straight game with a 117-97 victory over the Nets at Barclays Center. Brook Lopez scored 20 points for the Nets, who have lost seven straight and 12 of their last 13.JAZZ 100, CAVALIERS 92 Gordon Hayward went blow for blow with LeBron James in the second half to help Utah beat Cleveland in Salt Lake City. Hayward had 22 points and went back and forth with James during the decisive third quarter, during which James brought the Cavaliers back from a 15-point halftime deficit before Hayward drove the lead back to 14.BUCKS 109, SPURS 107 Michael Beasley scored a season-high 28 points in place of an ill Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Milwaukee rallied to win at San Antonio.

All-Star Game are brimming with top-shelf talent, although they lack an unusual fan-picked favorite like John Scott.The rookies Auston Matthews and Patrik Laine were among the 40 players selected for the N.H.L.’s All-Star weekend, which will be held Jan. 27-29 in Los Angeles. The game format will again be a three-on-three tournament featuring teams from each of the N.H.L.’s four divisions.The Pacific Division won the tournament last year, but the weekend was dominated by the unlikely story of Scott. A journeyman enforcer, he scored two goals in the tournament and was voted the most valuable player after a grass-roots online campaign by fans to vote him in as a captain.HURRICANES 5, BLUE JACKETS 3 Jordan Staal scored a go-ahead goal on a deflection with 16 minutes 10 seconds to play, and host Carolina beat Columbus, which has a league-best 60 points but has lost three of four.Manchester United closed in on the final of the English League Cup by beating injury-hit Hull, 2-0, in the first leg of their semifinal thanks to second-half goals by Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini. The second leg is at Hull on Jan. 26, and United is a huge favorite to reach the final for a ninth time.COSMOS COULD BE ON THE MOVE The Cosmos have a new owner and will most likely be moving from Long Island to New York City.Rocco B. Commisso, chief executive of Mediacom Communications Corporation and a former soccer player at Columbia, bought a majority ownership stake in the team, in the second-tier North American Soccer League, and will become the club’s chairman.The Cosmos have been playing at Hofstra’s Shuart Stadium. Commisso said the team had started discussions to play at MCU Park in Brooklyn, home of the Mets’ Class A team in the New York-Penn League, or at Columbia, which renamed its soccer stadium after him in 2013.Frida Hansdotter, the defending World Cup slalom champion, convincingly won the last race in the discipline ahead of next month’s world championships.Hansdotter lost almost four-tenths of a second off her commanding first-run lead but still finished 0.58 of a second ahead of Nina Loeseth in Lachau, Austria.Mikaela Shiffrin, the reigning Olympic champion, posted the fastest second-run time to share third place with Wendy Holdener, 0.78 of a second off the lead.A Michigan doctor accused of sexually abusing gymnasts was sued by 18 women and girls, the latest legal action over alleged assaults, mostly at his clinic at Michigan State.The lawsuit against Dr. Larry Nassar, Michigan State, U.S.A. Gymnastics and a Lansing-area gymnastics club was filed in federal court in western Michigan. It makes claims of civil rights violations, discrimination and negligence.Rachael Denhollander, a 32-year-old former gymnast, said she was assaulted by Nassar while seeing him for wrist and back injuries at age 15 in 2000. She said she did not file a complaint at the time because she believed her “voice would not be heard.”Almost five months after the Rio de Janeiro Olympics ended, another venue is struggling to find a use. Rio’s city hall said that the Deodoro Olympic Park, which was to be used as a park and recreation area after the Games, had been closed.Deodoro was the second-largest venue cluster during the Olympics. It held equestrian, rugby and field hockey events, among others."
Proposed Football League Envisions a No-College Path to the Pros,"The sports landscape is littered with failed professional football leagues, such is the dominance of the N.F.L.Yet the sports agent Don Yee, who represents New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, thinks he may have found a model that will work: a league for 18- to 21-year-old players who skip college to play professionally right away.Most fledgling leagues, like the defunct U.F.L. or the X.F.L., had rosters filled with castoffs who had gone undrafted out of college or who had bounced around pro teams. The quality of play was uneven, while games often overlapped with the N.F.L. and N.C.A.A. calendars, making it hard to gain attention.Yee and his investment group see their new Pacific Pro Football league, which is expected to start in summer 2018, as more of a development league filled with players who want to immediately start playing a pro-style game while getting a paycheck, rather than risking injury on a college team and receiving no compensation.“Most other leagues usually took players who were deemed not good enough for the N.F.L.,” Yee said. “We’re now trying to go to the head of the line at the buffet instead of getting the picked-over ones.”Despite the long odds of success, Yee is not the only person trying to get a football league off the ground. In April, a new spring league will roll out in West Virginia, where players “who may have been overlooked by the N.F.L., C.F.L. and other professional leagues” can pay $350 to showcase their talents in a six-game season, the league’s website says.The N.F.L. also has toyed with starting a developmental league. In October, Commissioner Roger Goodell said the team owners had discussed the idea of working with 300 to 400 players to make them “ready to play as quickly as possible,” though nothing concrete emerged from the discussions.Other leagues already employ teenagers who skip college. Major League Baseball clubs draft young players and send them to their academies or minor league affiliates. Many N.H.L. teams have players as young as 18 on their rosters. Players can join N.B.A. teams if they are 19 and a year removed from high school. (In 2001, the N.B.A. started its own development league, where the players can be 18.)N.F.L. teams can draft only players who are three years removed from their high school class’s graduation, a rule the league said is intended to protect younger, less physically developed players.“The physical, mental and emotional demands of our sport would make it almost impossible for someone to have success in the N.F.L. at an earlier age,” said Brian McCarthy, a league spokesman.Richard Lapchick, the director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, or Tides, said that the N.F.L. had an incentive not to undercut college football, which he said was a “great feeder system.”Even with an alternate league, college football, where players get scholarships but are not paid, would remain a strong draw for high school players because of the potential exposure, he said. He added that requiring athletes to spend more time in college makes it more likely that they will be prepared for life in the N.F.L. and after they retire from the game.“I don’t know how broad the interest in academic development is by the pro leagues, but someone who has a broader range of interests has a more balanced life and has the potential to be a better athlete,” he said.Yee acknowledged that his venture was risky, something his advisers have echoed. Fans already have a lot of options for watching college and professional football, and just paying for the necessary training facilities and transportation could be enough to bankrupt a new league.“I’ve danced with at least three of these groups before, but money was always what killed them,” said Jim Steeg, who is an unpaid adviser to Yee and ran the Super Bowl for the N.F.L. for decades.Steeg estimated that between $5 million and $7 million would be needed to cover the costs of each team for one season, along with a comparable sum to run the league office.Still, Steeg was encouraged that Yee was starting small and aiming for a unique pool of players, and that he had already received funding from an “angel” investor. Yee said he hoped to attract enough money in the next phase of fund-raising to cover the cost of a first season.The league would have four teams based in Southern California, both to reduce expenses and because the region has so many young players. The league would have a six-game schedule plus playoffs, and finish before the college season begins. Players would be paid an average of $50,000 in salary and benefits, including workers’ compensation, a 401(k) plan and free community college tuition.Yee wants to partner with companies in the area to create internships for the players to prepare them for when their football days are over.In addition to Steeg, Yee said he was being advised by, among others, the former N.F.L. coach Mike Shanahan; Mike Pereira, who was in charge of officiating for the N.F.L.; and the ESPN analyst Adam Schefter. Ed McCaffrey, a former Denver Broncos wide receiver, is a co-investor.Having enough money to get a league off the ground is one challenge. Finding a way to publicize it is another. With television already cluttered with dozens of games each week, the chances of a new league finding space on a widely distributed cable network are remote.Yee said that internet giants like Amazon and Netflix were looking for sports content to distribute. It is far from clear, however, whether one of those companies will pay Yee’s league to show games."
Lawsuit Accuses Michigan Doctor of Sexually Abusing Young Gymnasts,"Eighteen women and girls have filed a federal lawsuit alleging that a Michigan doctor sexually assaulted them and that U.S.A. Gymnastics and other organizations that employed him failed to address their concerns and prevent further abuse, some of it dating back to the late 1990s.In the civil suit filed against Dr. Lawrence Nassar on Tuesday in Federal District Court in western Michigan, the plaintiffs are seeking relief for injuries related to sexual assault, nonconsensual touching, abuse and molestation. They say the abuse occurred while they were participating in gymnastics, swimming, figure skating, track and field, field hockey, basketball and soccer.Most of the plaintiffs were minors when the abuse occurred, according to the suit, which alleges that Dr. Nassar “sexually assaulted, abused and molested” the athletes, including by “digital vaginal and anal penetration.”The lawsuit is the latest legal action against Dr. Nassar. In November, he was charged in Ingham County, Mich., with first-degree sexual conduct with a person under 13, and in December, he was indicted in federal court in Grand Rapids, Mich., on child pornography charges.Matthew R. Newburg, Dr. Nassar’s lawyer in those state and federal criminal cases, said by email on Wednesday that his client has pleaded not guilty in those cases. “We are still receiving discovery and continue to review the reports as we receive them,” he said.Stephen Drew, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the new civil case, said on Wednesday that some of the 18 women had raised red flags as far back as 2000. The suit also names as defendants the places where he had worked or had treated athletes: U.S.A. Gymnastics, Michigan State University and Gedderts’ Twistars Gymnastics Club U.S.A. in Michigan.The plaintiffs said that Dr. Nassar had been recommended to them as a “renowned orthopedic sports medicine physician” while working at the university from about 1996 to 2016, and for the United States gymnastics team from 1986 to 2015. He also provided medical care at Twistars, which has locations in Dimondale, Mich., and DeWitt, Mich.The lawsuit alleges that some of the plaintiffs had complained about being abused while being examined in a room alone with Dr. Nassar, or that he had positioned himself in such a way as to block the view of parents or chaperones.Mr. Drew said that some of the women and girls had not come forward sooner because they thought they would not be believed.“They need this addressed; they have been holding this in for years,” he said, adding that the impact on the plaintiffs has been “traumatic.”Adam C. Sturdivant, another lawyer, said that two or three more people were expected to join the civil lawsuit within a week. Mr. Newburg said that Dr. Nassar does not yet have a lawyer for that case.The lawsuit alleged that the three organizations had failed to properly supervise Dr. Nassar, were negligent in retaining him and did not address concerns from the athletes and their parents.A statement from U.S.A. Gymnastics on Wednesday did not directly address the latest lawsuit, saying that it was pending litigation. But the organization, the sport’s national governing body, said it found the “allegations against Dr. Nassar very disturbing.”“When we first learned of athlete concerns regarding Dr. Nassar in the summer of 2015, we immediately notified the F.B.I. and relieved him of any further assignments,” the statement said. “U.S.A. Gymnastics has fully cooperated with the F.B.I. in its investigation. We find it appalling that anyone would exploit a young athlete or child in this manner, and we are grateful to the athletes who have come forward.”The reports of sexual abuse in the sport cast a shadow on the gymnastics federation just as the U.S. Olympics team, which brought home 12 medals from the 2016 Games, was preparing for a post-Olympics market push.Jason Cody, a spokesman for Michigan State University said on Wednesday he could not comment on the pending litigation but the university was “deeply disturbed” by the criminal charges.He said in an emailed statement that the university had started an internal review and had found no evidence of any complaints about Dr. Nassar before Aug. 29, 2016, other than one in 2014 that was investigated. But, he added: “The criminal investigation into Larry Nassar is a top priority for M.S.U. Police.”John Geddert, a former Olympic coach and the owner of Twistars gymnastics school, did not return telephone messages left at the center’s two Michigan locations on Wednesday. The lawsuit said Dr. Nassar had been recommended to athletes there. The suit said a parent of a gymnast in 1997 had complained to Mr. Geddert about the doctor, but that the concerns “went unaddressed.”Mr. Drew, the lawyer, said some of the plaintiffs in Tuesday’s civil case were emboldened to come forward after an investigation published by The Indianapolis Star in August on allegations of sexual abuse by coaches of young athletes. The article included allegations that U.S.A. Gymnastics had routinely failed to notify law enforcement officials about sexual abuse claims.A second report by The Star, published in September, said two women had accused Dr. Nassar of sexually abusing them. One former gymnast, Rachael Denhollander, filed a police complaint that month against Dr. Nassar, who through his lawyer denied any wrongdoing.The other woman, a medalist on the 2000 United States Olympic team, filed a civil lawsuit against him and named U.S.A. Gymnastics as a defendant.Ms. Denhollander then joined the civil suit filed on Tuesday and is the only plaintiff to reveal her identity. That lawsuit said Dr. Nassar’s abuse of Ms. Denhollander occurred when she was a 15-year-old gymnast in 2000 and was sent to his office at M.S.U. several times for wrist and back injuries.Dr. Nassar is currently jailed in Michigan and cannot be contacted, according to Mr. Newburg.In a news conference on Tuesday, Ms. Denhollander said, according to The Indianapolis Star: “The reality of sexual abuse is that a pedophile is only as prominent as people around him allow him to be.“I will do everything in my power to make sure Larry Nassar is prosecuted for his crimes and can never harm another child.”"
Cowboys’ Dak Prescott Can Handle Any Kind of Pressure,"FRISCO, Tex. — What would it take to distract the Dallas Cowboys rookie quarterback Dak Prescott? On Wednesday, running back Ezekiel Elliott tried to find out.As Prescott spoke to reporters in the locker room — four days before his first playoff start, and at the center of a group so large that Prescott likened it to a Black Friday shopping crowd — Elliott lobbed balled-up pieces of tape at Prescott, again and again.When Prescott wouldn’t flinch, Elliott tried shooting straw wrappers at him, again and again. When Elliott finally connected, he celebrated with a shout: “Boom!”But Prescott never lost focus, never acknowledged Elliott, the Cowboys’ other prized rookie. He just grinned and kept talking.Green Bay will surely throw more complicated — and more dangerous — things at Prescott on Sunday when the Packers visit the Cowboys for an N.F.C. divisional playoff game, but in one way, Elliott’s antics provided a perfect snapshot of Prescott’s remarkable season.Nothing seems to faze him.Spitballs. Winning streaks. Criticism after a tough night. Praise after a great day.“I don’t know,” Prescott said when asked to describe the last time he felt nervous about a game. “That’s a good question. I’m sure sometime in college or another.”Asked to describe the moment, Prescott said he had been lying. That moment hadn’t happened at all.“I mean, I was just kind of saying that, you know, to throw an answer out there,” he said, laughing.This is the leader the Cowboys will follow onto the field against the Packers, a rugged 6-foot-2, 226-pound 23-year-old sturdy enough to shrug off defenders and steady enough to throw 23 touchdown passes and only four interceptions.That he has done it all as a surprise starter is remarkable. But the fact that he has done it in Dallas — for a team owned by a man who can’t seem to stop talking about how great Tony Romo is, or how ready Romo is to reclaim the quarterback spot if Prescott somehow relinquishes it — has made Prescott’s rookie performance even more striking.Last month, that owner, Jerry Jones, was talking so much about Romo that a former Cowboys quarterback, Troy Aikman, stepped up to question him on a Dallas radio program, saying Jones’s comments “just dumbfounded” him.Just the thought that an owner would praise a player who could replace you might fluster another quarterback — and certainly another rookie — but not Prescott. He remained in his bubble, leading the Cowboys on an 11-game winning streak, through a disappointing road defeat against the Giants and to a 13-3 record, tying a franchise mark.So how does an N.F.L. team happen upon a player like Prescott, whom the former Cowboys coach Dave Campo on Wednesday called “ice-cold” and “business all day long”?Before they drafted him, in the fourth round, the Cowboys stuck Prescott in a classroom and threw different plays and different coverages at him, seeing how he would respond to changing situations and to criticism if he answered wrong. They tried to trick him into making mistakes, or into panicking. And then they studied his reactions.All the while, their spies worked the periphery, grilling teammates and coaches and ex-teammates and former coaches and even personnel like Mississippi State’s equipment manager — anyone who might have known details about Prescott that other people hadn’t seen.In the end, the Cowboys decided they had found their man.“I guarantee you that nobody expected him to turn out like this, as good and as poised as this,” Campo said. “When you take a player, you have no idea; you really don’t. You just ask people you trust about him. But you never ask the head coach because he might love his players, kind of like Jerry Jones loves Tony Romo.”Jones, whose affection for Romo and other veterans is deep, and well known, acknowledged this week that he never expected Prescott to be this good this fast. When he spoke to my colleague Ken Belson on Monday, Jones said all of his hype about Romo being healthy enough to retake the starting job wasn’t meant to scare Prescott into playing harder, or designed to motivate the team.Jones also said he was pretty sure his comments about Romo didn’t affect Prescott at all.“I never thought it would,” he said. “He’s not fragile.”Jones added: “What it got to show was his unique makeup. He’s got an uncommon approach to preparing, unique stability and unprecedented leadership, and he exudes confidence to his teammates and coaching staff.”Prescott’s teammates saw that early on, probably earlier than Jones did.Even before Mark Sanchez signed with the Cowboys in early September — with Romo injured and ruled out for the start of the season — Sanchez had watched Prescott play in the preseason. When Sanchez saw him in person, he was even more impressed. When his father called and asked about Prescott, Sanchez gushed.“Pop, this kid can play,” Sanchez recalled saying.Of course, he can play, too, Sanchez said. Everyone at the N.F.L. level can play. “But he’s got something,” Sanchez said.The coolness under fire? Sanchez can’t explain that.“Listen, it’s not like he’s lying on the couch and I’m writing down his thoughts and that kind of stuff,” said Sanchez, 30, who has served as a mentor. “Let’s not make it bigger than it is; we’re just playing ball.”Prescott can’t say exactly why he is so cool, either. Maybe he was born that way. Maybe he learned to be like that somewhere on the road to Dallas. To delve into the reasons behind it, to try to pinpoint it, might take too long to discern, or to explain.So let’s just enjoy it. Perhaps for this one game on Sunday, perhaps for a few more."
Jim Furyk Will Lead Next U.S. Ryder Cup Team,"Jim Furyk was appointed Wednesday as the United States captain for the 2018 Ryder Cup in France, where the American team will try to win in Europe for the first time in 25 years.Furyk was a unanimous choice by the Ryder Cup committee. A former United States Open champion, he played on nine consecutive Ryder Cup teams, starting in 1997, and he was an assistant captain to Davis Love III last year at Hazeltine in Chaska, Minn., as the United States won the competition for the first time since 2008.A runner-up two years ago, Vance Joseph is John Elway’s pick this time around.“It’s official,” Elway, who runs the Broncos’ football operations, wrote on Twitter. “Excited to announce Vance Joseph as head coach of the Denver Broncos!”Joseph, 44, built a reputation as one of the N.F.L.’s best secondary coaches as he worked his way through the ranks with San Francisco, Houston and Cincinnati before serving as the Dolphins’ defensive coordinator this season.Joseph impressed Elway in 2015, when Gary Kubiak got Denver’s job, and the Broncos then tried to hire him as their defensive coordinator, a move the Bengals blocked.BILLS NAME RYAN’S REPLACEMENT The Buffalo Bills, who fired Rex Ryan last month, reached an agreement to hire Sean McDermott as their coach. McDermott, 42, has been the Carolina Panthers’ defensive coordinator for six seasons.Jason Demers scored the tiebreaking goal early in the second period, Roberto Luongo stopped 29 shots, and the Florida Panthers held on for a 2-1 victory over the Islanders at Barclays Center.

"Building a Stadium, Rebuilding a Neighborhood","ATLANTA — As fans stream into the Georgia Dome on Saturday to watch the Falcons play the Seattle Seahawks, they will pass a construction site next door.There the team owner and home improvement magnate Arthur Blank is building the Falcons’ new home, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, a $1.5 billion palace with eye-popping features: a 30-story-high retractable roof shaped like petals, the N.F.L.’s largest video board and enormous windows that face the Atlanta skyline.The view through the windows at the other end of the building tells a very different story, one that many fans go out of their way to avoid: English Avenue and Vine City, two of the poorest neighborhoods in the Southeastern United States. Home to drug dealers, swaths of empty plots and abandoned houses, they are part of the Westside, where 42 percent of the households are in poverty and the unemployment rate is twice that of the rest of Fulton County.The stadium’s place in that chasm between rich and poor is an uncomfortable reminder of the disconnect between the vast wealth of the N.F.L. and the cities to which they extend open palms. Immensely wealthy team owners, backed by a $13 billion-a-year league, routinely push local lawmakers to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies that, they claim, will pay for themselves through the creation of new jobs, new tax revenue and the intangible prestige of professional sports (the new stadium will host the Super Bowl in 2019.)The Falcons have been no different, getting a minimum of $200 million in hotel-motel taxes out of the city for the construction of the stadium, and potentially hundreds of millions more for its upkeep.But rarely does such public investment do much good for the areas around these mammoth stadiums. Such venues effectively blot out a part of the neighborhood when not in use, reducing foot traffic and fraying the fabric of the community. Even when stadiums do draw big crowds, ticket holders spend little of their money at local businesses.While some owners try to offset these problems by donating money to local charities or buying land to make way for new homes and shops, Blank wants to rebuild the neighborhoods where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Julian Bond and other civil rights leaders once lived.Blank's plans are ambitious not only because of the neighborhood’s history and decay, but also because he said he hopes to effect real change in the lives of his neighbors — though critics say it will be on his terms.So far, his foundation, the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation, has donated $20 million to pay for, among other things, a job training center called Westside Works, new parks, a youth leadership program called American Explorers, and homes for police officers willing to live in the area. Blank’s investments have been matched by groups including Invest Atlanta, the city’s development arm, more than doubling the amount raised.And Blank has also committed to spending millions more while also getting the team’s sponsors to strengthen their ties to the community.“Sometimes, these stadiums and facilities are built and not much happens around them; stuff takes place on the inside but not much on the outside,” said Blank, a co-founder of Home Depot. “It’s not about how many buildings you build, but how you change the quality of life of the people living there.”Stadiums and arenas on their own are rarely economic engines, though some are part of larger developments, like Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Teams like the Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco Giants are also very involved in their communities. Blank, though, is using philanthropy on a large scale as a development tool, something that could make the Westside safer and more prosperous, but could also benefit his stadium.“There are very few owners who make this type of investment in the community, in conjunction with a new stadium or in general,” said Alisha Greenberg, who runs Rounding Third, which tracks sports philanthropy. “Few owners are as involved and committed as Arthur Blank is: his passion for it, his commitment for it and the time he’s given.”While Blank’s spending on the Westside so far is significant, it is still just a fraction of what the city is spending on the stadium. Although some residents appreciate his efforts to create jobs and fight crime, others fear they will ultimately be pushed out.Indeed, speculators have bought up hundreds of parcels of land hoping to turn a quick profit, and rents have risen by about 20 percent since the stadium plan was announced in 2012, according to a Georgia Tech study.“This is not a sports stadium. This is a development deal, and unless you understand that, you can’t really get a grasp of what’s happening here,” said State Senator Vincent Fort, whose district includes English Avenue and Vine City. “The stadium deal is nothing but an engine for gentrification.”If the city “put as much money into the neighborhood as they’re putting into the stadium, I’d shut up and go away,” he added. “But that’s not going to happen.”The chief community liaison for the Blank Foundation, Frank Fernandez, said that a community benefits plan “was developed from a very deliberate process of public hearings and community meetings” and would provide a road map for development after the stadium was completed.But Fort and other critics of the stadium say that Blank and the city dictated the terms of their efforts to help the Westside, and have not agreed to a binding community benefits agreement, common in other big developments.“Instead, it’s like, we’re going to develop it the way we want to develop it and develop it for who we want to develop it for,” said Tim Franzen, who works at the Housing Justice League in Atlanta.Carrie Salvary, who bought a home in Vine City in 1993, said she was concerned that Blank and others trying to revitalize the Westside had not done more to protect historic buildings, including King’s home on Sunset Avenue.She said that lawmakers have also failed to hold absentee landlords accountable for the condition of their properties and done nothing to protect residents from rising rents.“That represents you are not serious, and that your goal is to make this a new place for new people,” said Salvary, who bought her home for $70,000 but saw the recession in 2008 wipe out some of the value it had gained. “I’ve been involved in this community since before the day I got here. And at this moment in time, I actually feel like I’m living on the Arthur M. Blank Family plantation, and I really don’t like that feeling.”The troubles on the Westside date at least to the 1970s, when new highways isolated poor neighborhoods. In preparation for the 1996 Olympics, the city built the Georgia Dome — construction that created another barrier between the Westside and downtown. In 2002, rainstorms overwhelmed the area’s aging sewage system, wiping out entire blocks that were never rebuilt.Blank became aware of these problems that same year, when he bought the Falcons for $545 million. (The value of the team has nearly quadrupled, to $2.125 billion, according to Forbes, and will surely rise once the stadium opens.) His foundation made incremental investments in the Westside, but he truly began to focus on the neighborhood after 2013, when the team chose to build on the 18 acres just south of the Georgia Dome for the new stadium, which will open in July. The Georgia Dome, which opened in 1992, played host to two Super Bowls but was deemed unworthy as the venue for another one and will be torn down to make way for parking.Despite some challenging topography, Blank picked the spot because it was next to two commuter rail stations and an easy walk from downtown and some 10,000 hotel rooms. But the Atlanta Falcons Stadium Company paid nearly $20 million to one church to move out, while the state bought out another church. He also hired Fernandez, a former football player at Harvard who helped disadvantaged families in Austin, Tex., to work with the community on a development plan.Fernandez was surprised at the scale of the problems on the Westside and the apprehension of the residents who remember the unmet promises of the past.“This is a very racialized atmosphere — the rich, white billionaire going to save the black folks,” he said while driving past boarded-up homes and shuttered churches and shops. “You can only go the speed of trust and just weather the storm. There will be a certain percentage of the neighborhood that will be skeptical of Arthur.”Given the depths of the problems, Blank and Fernandez acknowledge that it will take decades to revitalize the Westside. But they point to some early successes.Lloyd Foster, a former tattoo shop owner with a criminal background, learned how to use hand tools, read blueprints and follow safety standards at Westside Works. He now operates a freight elevator at the stadium and hopes to continue working there once the construction is complete.“When I first heard about the stadium, I didn’t think it was going to help the community because of all the other programs that didn’t do anything,” said Foster, 51, who says he earns about $60,000 with overtime. “But I could see where it was going. You could see the money invested and the growth.”Rolanda Gardner, another Westside resident, graduated from a culinary arts class in May and has landed a job as a baker at the convention center. She lost 30 pounds during the eight-week program, she said, because of the hectic schedule and a better understanding of nutrition. She also started her own catering business, which provides gluten-free meals to a preschool program.“This program has given the Westside such an incentive,” Gardner said, tears streaming down her face. “Now we can do more for our families.”Blank has also used the stadium itself to help; among other ways, by building a 680,000-gallon cistern to capture rainwater that might otherwise flood the local streets. Some of the team’s construction partners have also contributed money or expertise: SunTrust has introduced low-cost check cashing in the area; IBM has donated software to neighborhood nonprofits; and employees from other sponsors are mentoring Westside residents to improve their job skills.“We provide a vehicle to make a difference,” said Tim Zulawski, the chief commercial officer of Blank’s sports and entertainment businesses, which also include a soccer team, Atlanta United. “A lot of teams are using their personal clout, but I haven’t seen this on this scale.”Even a short drive around the neighborhood, though, illustrates how much work needs to be done. One evening last month, Officer C. D. Taylor of the Atlanta Police Department patrolled the Westside, where dark streets are lined by abandoned homes that he called “bandos.”With his window down — all the better to smell if drugs are being used by those he passes — Officer Taylor shined his spotlight into backyards where drug dealers and prostitutes often work. Uber drivers and pizza deliverymen are routinely mugged here, and construction workers who park near the stadium have had their cars broken into, he said.But he also sees potential, if it seems distant. People are starting to buy homes to fix up — not just to resell, but to live in, he said. And thanks to the construction of the stadium, more people are starting to realize that the worst may be over for the area.“There will definitely be more development,” he said. “There’s a lot of money out there that can be made.”"
"Congratulations, Los Angeles: You Now Have 2 Terrible Football Teams","After 21 years without an N.F.L. team, Los Angeles, the nation’s second-largest city, will soon have two. The Rams moved to town for this season, and on Thursday, the Chargers announced that they would join them next season. Here’s what we know about football in Los Angeles for 2017.A second bad football team.After consecutive 9-7 seasons, the San Diego Chargers sank to 4-12 and 5-11 the last two years. Particularly disappointing, after a decent 5-6 start, were the last five games, all losses. The team fired Coach Mike McCoy after four seasons and is hunting for someone new who likes sunny weather.The Chargers’ chief problem was on the defensive side; they allowed 423 points, the fourth highest total in the league.Still, the Chargers are not as bad as the Rams. That franchise has endured 10 straight losing seasons, including an abysmal 4-12 record this season, their first in Los Angeles. The Rams fired their coach, Jeff Fisher, and announced on Thursday that they had hired Sean McVay, who at 30 years old is the youngest head coach in N.F.L. history.The Rams were 32nd and last in yards per play, and also 32nd in yards per pass. The good news is that they were 31st in yards per rush. Those numbers mean they scored only 224 points, an average of 14 a game, the lowest in the N.F.L. Hardly a way to take the town by storm.Not exactly. The Rams somehow managed two Pro Bowl players, defensive tackle Aaron Donald and a punter, Johnny Hekker. (The Rams punted 98 times, second most in the league.) The Chargers will not help the star power: Their only selection was a cornerback, Casey Hayward, as a backup.At the marquee position of quarterback, the Chargers’ Philip Rivers churned out another so-so season. The Rams’ anemic offense was led first by the journeyman Case Keenum and later by the rookie Jared Goff, who has not yet lived up to being the No. 1 pick in the draft.Are you seeing any strong contenders for cameos on “Family Guy” or “Code Black” in there?While they wait for a new stadium to be finished, maybe for 2019, the Rams are playing in the ancient Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, whose huge capacity has meant that seats have been readily available. Sections of the stadium were often blocked off to avoid the sight of fans sunbathing in their own rows.That could have been the case for the Chargers as well. But until the new stadium is ready, they have opted to play  in the StubHub Center, in Carson, Calif., which seats only 27,000 for its primary tenant, the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer. That will make the Chargers one of the toughest tickets in the N.F.L., no matter how bad they are.At the very least, the Chargers will avoid the possibility of playing in front of thousands of empty seats.Most people remember that the Rams played in the Los Angeles area for decades before heading to St. Louis and playing there from 1995 to 2015. But the Chargers are also coming home again.In 1960, the first year of the American Football League, the Los Angeles Chargers played in the Coliseum. The team was actually good, with a 10-4 record and a trip to the championship game. But the owner Barron Hilton shipped the team to San Diego after one year.“Chargers” was selected in a name-the-team contest and stuck around for all those years in San Diego.Los Angeles joins East Rutherford, N.J., (Giants and Jets) as locales with two N.F.L. teams.The team began using a new logo on its social media accounts, although it is not getting sterling reviews so far. As you might expect, it’s an “LA” with a lightning bolt. It doesn’t help that the San Diego Chargers’ classic lightning bolt logo was revered.Many people are seeing distinct similarities with the Los Angeles Dodgers’ logo, and maybe the Tampa Bay Lightning’s too.The consensus of modern economists is that the benefits of a major sports franchise are dubious. Money spent on games would probably be spent on other forms of entertainment anyway, they say.Any small financial gains may be negated by municipal subsidies and givebacks to teams anyway.Most of the benefits to a city are psychic. Pro teams can make a city feel “major league,” although an inferiority complex is not something Los Angeles has generally been afflicted with (unless the topic is competing with New York for cultural relevance).Sure. San Diego and St. Louis for starters.Discounting Riverside, Calif., which could be considered part of the Los Angeles region, the biggest metropolitan area without an N.F.L. team is now San Diego, ranked 17th. St. Louis, the 20th biggest area, is next.The biggest metropolitan area that has never had an N.F.L. team is 23rd-ranked Portland, Ore.And Los Angeles remains a huge television market. Ultimately, broadcasting contracts are where the N.F.L. makes its money."
L.A. Rams Make Sean McVay the Youngest Coach in N.F.L. History,"LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles Rams hired Sean McVay on Thursday, making him the youngest head coach in N.F.L. history.McVay, who will turn 31 on Jan. 24, spent the last three seasons as the Washington Redskins’ offensive coordinator. He has been an assistant in Washington since 2010.He replaces Jeff Fisher, who was fired 13 games into the Rams’ homecoming season in Los Angeles, and John Fassel, the interim head coach for the last three games.McVay wowed the Rams’ top brass in two recent interviews. He takes charge of a franchise that is rebuilding from a 4-12 season, its 13th consecutive nonwinning campaign. The Rams are in a 12-year playoff drought.The previous youngest coach in league history, Lane Kiffin, was 31 when the Oakland Raiders hired him in January 2007."
"With a Healthy Joel Embiid, the Philadelphia 76ers Glimpse a Brighter Future","PHILADELPHIA — It is a headline that once seemed more likely to appear on a fake-news website: Philadelphia 76ers win for fourth time in five games!But that claim has been verified: The Sixers, that franchise shamed by accusations of tanking and making a sham of competitive basketball, are actually winning games.So now what? Time to dance!Joel Embiid did not let a sprained left ankle stop him from showing off his moves after a recent victory. He crashed the 76ers dance team’s celebration and flailed his arms in the air like one of those inflatable figures at car dealerships. Embiid was energetic after the Sixers rallied from 10 points behind with 2 minutes 29 seconds left and beat the Knicks on T. J. McConnell’s jumper at the buzzer.Embiid, a social-media darling, is positive about the Sixers’ future.“Playoff time, baby,” Embiid said.Hold up. Do not download those postseason tickets just yet. Even after that encouraging streak, the Sixers are only 11-25.But Embiid, a 7-foot center with an affinity for nonalcoholic cocktails, has added a splash of fun in his long-delayed rookie year, helping to make the Sixers more compelling this season.Embiid has generated buzz through his celebrity crushes (hello, Rihanna!) and celebrity fans (hi, Mike Trout!), and he has become the Ellen DeGeneres of the 76ers with a victory dance in big moments.And it is because of Embiid that the Sixers are finally finding those big moments. Even with playing-time restrictions, Embiid has helped the Sixers win 11 times, already one more win than all of last season.Embiid has played in 26 of 36 games and leads the Sixers in per-game averages for points (19.4), blocks (2.3) and rebounds (7.5). His 52 assists have allowed the team’s public address announcer to refer to “the feed from Embiid” at times.Already a fan favorite before he played a game, Embiid had adopted the Process as a nickname and is introduced as such in the pregame lineup. Embiid waves his arms and exhorts fans to get louder as they chant, “Trust the Process!” — the mantra coined in the Sam Hinkie era, when tanking games, rather than winning them, was the theme.As protective as the Sixers have been of Embiid’s health, they have orchestrated a social-media effort to get him into the All-Star Game. Embiid has long been a fan of Shirley Temples, an alcohol-free concoction of lemon-lime soda, grenadine and a maraschino cherry, and the Sixers sold the drink in a promotional push to get him an All-Star spot.With 457,300 fan votes, Embiid was fourth among frontcourt players in the latest round of All-Star voting totals released Thursday. He needs to crack the top three to earn an Eastern Conference starting spot but was 16,028 votes shy of Cleveland’s Kevin Love for third.The team still faces a harsh reality check as it moves closer to the Feb. 23 trade deadline. The Sixers have one too many starting centers, and the combination of Embiid and Jahlil Okafor was a flop. Okafor, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2015 draft and last season’s leading scorer, has been benched. He sat against the Knicks on Wednesday, the fourth time he had done so in the last six games.“I’m just trying to do my part to make sure it all works out,” Okafor said.Nerlens Noel has been solid and has been the best option to team at power forward with Embiid. Ersan Ilyasova has made everyone better, and acquiring him in a trade was a major coup for the team’s president, Bryan Colangelo.Ben Simmons, the No. 1 overall draft pick, has been strong in his comeback from a broken right foot and could make his season debut this month. The Sixers have not put a timetable on his return, but he competed in 5-on-0 drills this week for the first time and has started traveling with the team.Coach Brett Brown may have his best team in four seasons, but the Sixers are well out of the playoff picture. The wins in their 4-1 streak (which included two buzzer-beaters) came in games against the Denver Nuggets, the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Nets and the Knicks — all sub-.500 teams. They play teams with records of .500 or above in eight of the next nine games.Embiid, who sat out two seasons with a broken right foot, is restricted to 28 minutes per game and does not play full sets of back-to-backs. He is scheduled to start Friday against Charlotte and sit Saturday at Washington.But there are high hopes that Embiid, Simmons and Noel could be the trio to lead the Sixers back to the playoffs next season for the first time since 2012.“When you really set the bar as high as we have, there is a lot left to be learned — and done,” Brown said. “It’s a heck of a lot clearer now than it ever was.”"
Boston Breakers’ Draft Strategy Reflects Confidence in Women’s League,"LOS ANGELES — Viewers tuning into the online livestream of the National Women’s Soccer League draft Thursday could be forgiven for thinking their feed was caught in a perpetual loop, as it endlessly repeated, “The Boston Breakers are on the clock.”It only seemed that way. What viewers were watching was a roster-rebuilding strategy with few precedents. A series of off-season trades and roster moves had set up the Breakers with the most picks of any of the league’s teams: five of the first 11 selections, and seven over all.The result was the spectacle of a rebuilding team — one that has struggled on the field and in its efforts to recruit top American stars — remaking its roster in real time, one fresh new face at a time. But it was also a show of confidence, Breakers officials said, that the five-year-old league was finally established enough for Thursday’s play to pay dividends.“Previously, it’s really been about the here and now,” said Lee Billiard, the Breakers’ president for soccer operations and development. “And last year, it started to be about the picks today, and what they’ll mean for next year. It wasn’t, until last year, about longevity.”Ultimately, the Breakers — who had picks Nos. 1, 3, 8 and 9 — added four new players in the first round, most notably the top pick, Rose Lavelle, a 21-year-old box-to-box midfielder out of the University of Wisconsin who immediately became the team’s star attraction.The Breakers then added Southern California midfielder Morgan Andrews with the third pick, and forwards Ifeoma Onumonu (California) and Margaret Purce (Harvard) at Nos. 8 and 9.The unusual strategy took shape over the previous few months. Critical was a trade with the Washington Spirit that raised eyebrows around the league, in which Boston acquired picks Nos. 3 and 9, as well as Megan Oyster, in exchange for Kasey Kallman and Kristie Mewis. Next, the Breakers traded the 12th, 16th and 21st picks to Chicago for picks Nos. 8 and 38.The idea, Billiard said, is to collect a group of players who can play the way Coach Matt Beard wants, and drafting them all at once allows Beard, who previously coached Chelsea Ladies F.C. and Liverpool Ladies F.C. in England, to mold them together. And this draft is not the end of that process.“League growth is coming,” Billiard said. “There are expansion teams that are going to be coming in. But we’ve gotten ourselves in position to have a strong, competitive team this year and pick up some future picks to guard against an upcoming expansion draft. We’re already thinking that far ahead.”The infusion of young talent Thursday came at a moment when the N.W.S.L. needed some good news. The Orlando Pride’s Alex Morgan is now Olympique Lyon’s Alex Morgan, at least until midseason, after she agreed to a short-term loan to the French powerhouse. Crystal Dunn, the league’s most valuable player in 2015, recently departed for Chelsea.Those moves broke the virtual monopoly the N.W.S.L. had on United States national team players, but they were not the only worrisome moves; Kadeisha Buchanan and Ashley Lawrence, young Canadians who had have been coveted by the league, chose to sign with European clubs instead of entering the draft.Boston’s draft strategy was also a nod to the short window for players who are not on the national team to remain in the league, where low pay for mid-tier and low-end players remains an issue.Still, league officials stressed Thursday, each year brings incremental progress. The league’s survival is no longer its biggest concern, and attendance grew in 2016, with a leaguewide increase of 10.1 percent.The N.W.S.L.’s president, Jeff Plush, indicated that he would announce a new television contract within 30 days, and he also said there would soon be an announcement about increased player salaries. Those details are expected to include a bump in minimum and maximum pay for players who are not on the national team.He had no news to share, however, on the biggest question hanging over the league: the ongoing labor dispute between players on the United States women’s team and U.S. Soccer, which pays their league salaries as part of its subsidizing of the N.W.S.L.“We’re not part of that negotiation,” Plush said. “We’re going to let that negotiation run its course. We know we’re going to have our camps open, players will be excited to be there, and when that gets resolved, those players will be in camp as well.”Accordingly, teams are planning for the longer term, taking steps now to guard against potential losses in an expansion draft — if rumored teams in Vancouver and Los Angeles are added for 2018. That might have been why Boston, flush with picks in this year’s draft, promptly flipped its fifth, the 11th selection over all, for a second-rounder next year and the roster space for an as-yet-unnamed international player.The deal also gave the Breakers a little break, though not for long. They were back on the clock at No. 31, where they added Southern Cal goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme, and then at 38, Hayley Dowd, the Boston College product heading home."

They will beat the Chiefs because there is no stopping Le’Veon Bell’s two good ones.Bell has rushed for 1,002 yards in the past seven games, including a team postseason record 167 yards in a 30-12 wild-card victory over Miami last weekend. We’re talking about a franchise that counts Franco Harris and Jerome Bettis as alumni. Bell went for 144 yards on 18 carries in the first meeting against Kansas City, and the Chiefs’ 26th-ranked rushing defense (121.1 yards per game) looks none the wiser.Even if the Chiefs stack the deck with run defenders, Roethlisberger can throw deep to Pro Bowl receiver Antonio Brown — injured foot or not. That more than compensates for a Steelers defense with no Pro Bowl selections for two straight years.Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith is good at not losing games — he ranks third in wins by a quarterback since 2011 (behind Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers). His one interception in 186 postseason pass attempts stands as the N.F.L. interception-percentage record. In games such as this, however, the Chiefs need Smith to do more than simply not make mistakes. With wide receiver Tyreek Hill and tight end Travis Kelce running routes, Kansas City will have its chances.The game was originally scheduled for 1 p.m. but rescheduled for Sunday night because of a forecasted ice storm.Pick: Steelers.4:40 p.m. Sunday. TV: Fox. Line: Cowboys by 4½Jan. 7, 1996. That was the last time the Cowboys won a divisional-round playoff game, on the way to their last Super Bowl victory.Dallas running back Ezekiel Elliott was about 5 months old. Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott was 2½. If the Cowboys finally get back to the N.F.C. championship game, it will because of what these two rookie Pro Bowl players can do.Behind a decorated offensive line, Elliott became the fifth rookie to lead the N.F.L. in rushing (1,631 yards), and Prescott tied the rookie quarterback record with 13 victories. In the first meeting with the Packers, Elliott dictated the pace with 28 carries for 157 yards while facing a defense that ranked eighth against the run by season’s end. More Elliott is in order.Green Bay has won seven straight games by way of quarterback Aaron Rodgers’s 22 touchdown throws, no interceptions and 120.7 passer rating. One complication for Rodgers: a rib injury sustained last weekend by his leading receiver, Jordy Nelson, the owner of 97 catches for 1,257 yards and 14 touchdowns.Another problem for Green Bay: stopping the pass. Only one team, the Saints, allowed more yards in the air this season. With Elliott luring safeties into run-stop mode, Prescott is positioned for a substantial postseason debut.Pick: Cowboys.Time: 4:35 p.m. Saturday. TV: Fox. Line: Falcons by 5Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan passed for 4,944 yards and 38 touchdowns this season. His 69.9 percent completion rate, impeccable; his 117.1 passer rating, league-leading.How do you beat the All-Pro quarterback twice in three months? Leave him idling on the sidelines for protracted stretches of game time.Enter Seahawks running back Thomas Rawls. Rawls rushed for 161 yards — tops in the team’s postseason history — in a 26-6 victory over the Lions in the wild-card round. Amazing, considering that Seattle, with a makeshift offensive line, ranked 24th in rushing during the regular season. The Falcons’ defense ranked 26th in yards allowed per carry (4.52). A rushing-based offense is Seattle’s most plausible course to victory.Ryan and receiver Julio Jones are the arm and legs behind the league’s top-scoring offense — they connected seven times for 139 yards and one touchdown in the first meeting with Seattle. Everything Devonta Freeman, a 1,000-yard rusher, does is to set up the deep strike to Jones.Seattle came back to beat the Falcons because safety Earl Thomas grabbed a late interception on a pass intended for Jones. With Thomas injured and done for the season, Seattle’s “Legion of Boom” defense could be muffled.Pick: Falcons.8:15 p.m. Saturday. TV: CBS. Line: Patriots by 16The Texans bring the league’s No. 1-ranked defense to Foxborough. Big deal, says the history of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.Brady is 7-0 when he and the Patriots play host to a No. 1-ranked defense, including a 406-yard performance in a 30-23 victory Dec. 12 against the Baltimore Ravens, then top-ranked defensively. If New England’s third-string quarterback, Jacoby Brissett, could beat the Texans, 27-0, on Sept. 22, what will happen when they face Brady, the owner of three Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Awards?The Patriots are 4-0 at home against the Texans. The aggregate score: 150-49. No wonder the Patriots opened as the bookmakers’ biggest playoff favorite of the 21st century.The Texans can forget about stopping Brady, who set an N.F.L. single-season record with a 28-2 touchdown-to-interception ratio. Their offense must find a way to respond. Wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins is a torch from sideline to sideline. Lamar Miller, who topped the 1,000-yard rushing mark, gained 107 all-purpose yards in the September meeting. Quarterback Brock Osweiler beat the Patriots, 30-24, in overtime last season — while he was a Denver Bronco.New England is a victory away from becoming the first N.F.L. team to reach six consecutive conference championship games. A loss here would rival its Super Bowl XLII defeat against the Giants on the shock scale.Pick: Patriots."
"If You Lose the Next Point I’m Sending You to Your Room, Young Man","At professional squash tournaments, players get tips and advice from a trusted source during two-minute breaks between games. That source is typically a coach or another pro, someone who has competed at the highest levels.There are exceptions. The best player in the world today is a rangy 25-year-old Egyptian named Mohamed El Shorbagy, a.k.a. the Beast of Alexandria. Between games his counsel of choice is a woman of a certain age, wearing an expression of deep concern and a hijab.That is Mohamed’s mother, Basma El Shorbagy — and she has never played squash.To fans, the midmatch mother-son powwows have become one of the game’s most reliable and endearing spectacles. There is Ms. Shorbagy, leaning over her child as he sweats in a chair, catching his breath. She lectures and gesticulates. He hydrates and listens.“I’m not the easiest person to talk to between games,” Mohamed El Shorbagy said in an interview last week. “But she understands me better than anyone else in the world. She knows how to motivate me. She knows how to say the exact right words at the exact right moment.”The El Shorbagys arrived in Manhattan last week for the Tournament of Champions, a celebrated stop on the professional tour, held annually in a glass court erected in Vanderbilt Hall at Grand Central Terminal. Other tournaments may have more prestige, but the ToC is arguably the highest-profile and most raucous event of the year, attracting a stream of commuters who gape at the action, free, from the front wall. Tickets to seats on the other three sides of the court start at $10 for early rounds and rise to $450 by the finals.El Shorbagy, who won his first-round match on Thursday night, is the defending champion, having won here in both 2015 and 2016. But this year, the very large group of contenders includes Karim Abdel Gawad, a fellow Egyptian who twice beat El Shorbagy in tournaments late in 2016, including a definitive three-games-to-nil thumping at the Qatar Classic.To other players on the tour, there is something faintly amusing about El Shorbagy’s not-so-secret weapon. Daryl Selby, an Englishman ranked 15th in the world, remembers a group of players cracking up at one of Mohamed’s matches as mother hectored son.“He’d lost a game, and she marched straight over to him, and you could see that she was getting really animated,” Selby said.He added: “There’s this guy in his 20s, the best player in the world, getting told off by his mom, and he looks like he’s about to cry. But whatever she said, it worked. Because he got back on the court and won.”Ms. El Shorbagy volunteered years ago for her critical role. She was with her son at the squash club in Alexandria the day Mohamed, then just 9, was spotted by the onetime Egyptian national champion Gamal Awad.“He told me: ‘Your son is going to be the best player in the world. I want to coach your son, for free,’” she recalled in a phone call last week. “He convinced me. I had to believe him.”Ms. El Shorbagy can appear a bit dour at tournaments, in part because the cameras of SquashTV, which broadcast over the internet, are often trained on her when her son is in a pickle. But she has a levity about her that you would not predict watching her fidget in the bleachers. Asked what she tells her son between games, she initially demurred with a giggle.“It’s my secret!” she said.Getting serious, she explained that her training as a civil engineer gave her the idea that any problem can be solved if it is studied enough — including the matter of how to play great squash. In addition, she has an immense base of knowledge, having listened to countless hours of strategizing by world-class coaches. One of them is Jonah Barrington, a six-time British Open champion, who coached at Millfield, an elite boarding school in England, which Mohamed attended on scholarship.After Mohamed’s first year there, Ms. El Shorbagy and her husband, who works as an engineer, decided it would ease their son’s entry into a new culture if she moved to England and rented a house near Millfield. Mohamed lived with her, becoming a sort of day student at the boarding school. She attended Mohamed’s practices and learned the Barrington catechism.“My parents would see each other only two months out of the year while I was at school,” Mohamed said. “It wasn’t easy for them to live this kind of life. They sacrificed a lot.”When El Shorbagy played in the junior ranks, much of his mother’s instructions concerned focus. These days, she might offer tactical pointers — pick up the pace, lob more, work this guy’s backhand — but her most valuable contributions seem to be big picture and psychological.“Here’s an example,” said Mohamed, who speaks nearly as quickly as he moves on the court. “I was playing the finals of the El Gouna in April, against Gregory Gaultier, the world No. 2. I found myself down, two games to none. My mother came to me. I told her: ‘I don’t think I can come back. I’m feeling too much pressure. My legs feel heavy.’“And she just told me: ‘Don’t think about winning or losing. Just, every time you finish a point, think about fighting for the next point. The way you’re playing now, you are going to regret it. You don’t want to go out with regrets. Fight.”El Shorbagy won the next three games in a row, and the title.Aside from the occasional mental lapse, there are not a lot of flaws in his game. At 6 feet 1 inch, he has the wingspan and speed to make him one of the game’s best retrievers. His forehand is so crushing it forces a “ping” from the ball that sounds like a cry for mercy. The SquashTV commentator Joey Barrington — Jonah’s son and a former professional himself — has described El Shorbagy as one of the few players who can “bully” an opponent with raw power, though his touch is deceptively supple when he needs a drop shot.El Shorbagy said that losses to Gawad, a friend and rival since childhood, had inspired a newfound dedication, but he knows that the Baby-Faced Assassin, as Gawad is now reverently known, is hardly the only player standing between him and a third ToC trophy. Another potential obstacle is El Shorbagy’s lithe and savvy younger brother, Marwan, who has rocketed up the rankings in the past two years, and is currently No. 6 in the world.(Topic for further inquiry: What on earth is going on with squash in Egypt? Seven of the top 10 male players, and four of the top female players, are Egyptian — a level of domination that exceeds even what the Chinese have achieved in table tennis.)Basma El Shorbagy has been an eager between-game counsel to Marwan, too. But there is a problem when her sons face each other in tournaments, which has happened five or six times. (Mohamed has won each match.) Often a nervous observer, Ms. El Shorbagy says it is pure agony to see her only children compete against each other.“You can’t imagine my situation in these moments, really,” she said. “Because Mohamed is No. 1, I can’t want anyone to beat him. But at the same time, I want Marwan to be No. 1.”If both El Shorbagys win their early rounds, they will meet in the quarterfinals. Mohamed sounds ready for his brother and everyone else he may encounter at Grand Central. In December, after his second loss to Gawad, he retreated to his training base in Bristol and called his mother.“I told her, ‘You need to come to England now,’” he said. “‘We have a month to get ready for the second half of the season. I don’t like what’s happened in the first half. I can’t do this as an individual. We have to do it as a team.’ And a couple days later, she got a plane and flew over.”"
Players to Watch at the Australian Open,"The Australian Open, the first Grand Slam tennis tournament of the year, begins on Monday in Melbourne. While the spotlight may be on the return of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams, and the rivalry between Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray, other players have the potential to make a splash over the next two weeks.Under the tutelage of Dani Vallverdu, who once worked with Murray and Tomas Berdych, Dimitrov is playing his best tennis in years. Burdened with the nickname Baby Fed, for his game’s similarities to Federer’s, Dimitrov, 25, has been plagued by inconsistent play and a lack of mental toughness. But this month, in Brisbane, Australia, he stunned the field, beating three top-10 players in a row on the way to the championship. Dimitrov, who has worked his way back to 15th in the rankings, stayed calm in the big moments as he defeated No. 8 Dominic Thiem, No. 3 Milos Raonic and No. 5 Kei Nishikori. His remarkable shotmaking ability is still there, but he is winning by keeping more balls in play, especially on the return of serve. He broke the big-serving Raonic twice in the semifinals, employing a chip return effectively and then using his speed to track down the first-strike groundstrokes.Zverev, a 19-year-old German, is the highest-ranked teenager in the men’s game, at 24th. He began the season by beating Federer in the Hopman Cup in Perth, Australia, a win that echoed his upset of Federer last summer on the grass at Halle, Germany. The 6-foot-6 Zverev has a complete game, with a serve that at times seems unreturnable. His physical strength is improving under the guidance of Jez Green, who helped Murray grow from a scrawny teenager to a superbly fit athlete. Look for Zverev to climb into the top 10 this year after his breakout year in 2016.With his weighty forehand and devastating kick serve, Sock, 24, packs a powerful one-two punch that has vaulted him into the top 25 in the rankings. He backpedals to run around his backhand faster than anyone in the game, with the possible exception of Nadal in his prime. Sock plays an energetic, acrobatic, physical style of tennis, punishing his opponent with audacious shotmaking. He won a warm-up tournament Saturday in Auckland, New Zealand, and this season he has a chance to move past John Isner for good as the top American man. Sock is not yet a threat to win the title in Melbourne, but he has the game and the competitive zeal to go deep into the second week.Pliskova, 24, a surprise finalist at the 2016 United States Open after an upset of Serena Williams, began this season by dominating the field in Brisbane, dropping only one set in the tournament. Last month, she was a leader in the Fed Cup final, beating Kristina Mladenovic, 16-14, in the third set to help the Czech Republic defeat France. Pliskova’s clean, economical technique allows her to hit at great pace with seeming ease. But her serve is what has vaulted her to the top of the women’s game. Her smooth delivery is a pleasure to behold, as she hits her targets with pinpoint accuracy. Pliskova, who has risen to No. 5 in the rankings, has never advanced past the third round in Melbourne, but she is a vastly better player than she was a year ago.With her booming serve and strong, two-handed backhand, Konta, 25, reached the semifinals in Melbourne last year, starting a journey that led her into the top 10. She credited her improvement to a more relaxed, process-oriented approach to competition. In the off-season, she hired Wim Fissette as her new coach and worked to improve her forehand and return of serve. Against Eugenie Bouchard in the semifinals in Sydney, Australia, last week, Konta ripped forehand winners and returned flawlessly in a victory in straight sets, and she went on to overpower Agnieszka Radwanska with 32 winners in the final on Friday. At 5-11, she serves bombs, and her favorite ace is down the middle in the ad court. With the experience she gained last season, she has set her sights on winning a Grand Slam title.Kasatkina, a 19-year-old Russian, stunned top-ranked Angelique Kerber in straight sets in Sydney last week, and came within a point of toppling Garbiñe Muguruza the week before in Brisbane. Ranked 26th, she is a powerful all-court player who uses her heavy topspin forehand to open up the court. She volleys superbly and attacks the net when she earns a short ball. Although she is an aggressive ball striker, she can also play patiently from the backcourt, mixing in loops and slices to break up an opponent’s rhythm."
Start of Chiefs-Steelers Game Moved to Sunday Night,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Citing public safety concerns in the face of a potentially crippling ice storm here this weekend, the N.F.L. moved Sunday’s playoff game between the Chiefs and the Pittsburgh Steelers at Arrowhead Stadium to an 8:20 p.m. Eastern start.The league said in a statement that changing the game time, which was originally 1:05 p.m., would allow the authorities to clear roads and improve driving conditions. The worst of the freezing rain is expected to start late Saturday night and continue into Sunday morning and early afternoon.Although snowstorms in the past have prompted the league to change the site and days of regular-season games — the Vikings had three games affected in 2010 alone — the N.F.L. says it believes this is the first time a postseason game has been shifted since 1932.That year, a blizzard forced the first playoff game, between the Chicago Bears and the Portsmouth Spartans, to move indoors, to Chicago Stadium from Wrigley Field. That game, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, was played on a field with altered dimensions — 80 yards long, instead of 100, and 10 yards narrower."
Syracuse Is at a Crossroads in Its Final Four Repeat Bid,"Nearly a year after Coach Jim Boeheim led Syracuse on a surprising run to the Final Four for the fifth time in his 41-year career, he finds himself searching for answers to his current team’s struggles.With a daunting stretch of the schedule — and March — fast approaching, the Orange are at a make-or-break point.“We need to get better,” Boeheim said. “That’s what I can say for sure.”Before the end of the month, the Orange (10-7, 2-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) have three games against ranked opponents — at No. 11 North Carolina and No. 20 Notre Dame and hosting No. 9 Florida State. Those three teams had a combined record of 46-6 heading into this weekend.After tinkering with his lineup, Boeheim guided Syracuse to convincing wins at home last week over Miami and Pittsburgh. The defense rose to the occasion, and point guard John Gillon had 11 assists in each game to inject some needed confidence after a lackluster nonconference schedule that produced five losses.Any hope that Boeheim had finally pieced together a lineup that would take care of the team’s early-season problems was dashed on Tuesday night in a 10-point road loss to Virginia Tech. The Hokies shot nearly 50 percent, while Gillon was 2 for 9 from the floor in a performance that produced just three assists with two turnovers.Perhaps the most telling statistic of all: Virginia Tech scored 17 points in transition to zero for Syracuse, a team that has traditionally thrived in transition.“I think that they forgot we won two games in a row because our defense was good,” Boeheim said. “Our defense was horrendous, and our offense isn’t going to quite be good enough to make up for that level of defense.”The long-range offense certainly was not there, either. Syracuse was 5 of 17 (29.4 percent) on 3-pointers, a subpar performance for a team that has hit 154 3-pointers, second in the A.C.C. to Notre Dame.An injury early in the game to forward Tyler Lydon, the team’s leading rebounder and No. 2 scorer, did not help either. Lydon entered the game averaging 13.5 points in league play but scored just 2 against the Hokies in 29 minutes.“He said he was all right,” Boeheim said. “Probably should have not played him. He didn’t move very well.”Syracuse returns to action Saturday by hosting Boston College (9-8, 2-2 A.C.C.), and the memory of their first meeting of the season has probably not faded for either team. Two weeks ago in the Orange’s A.C.C. opener, the Eagles ran wild in the Syracuse zone, hitting 16 of 26 shots from 3-point range in a 96-81 triumph.Boston College is coming off a 74-66 win at home over North Carolina State on Thursday night. This clearly is not the team that a year ago went 0-18 in the A.C.C. during the regular season and lost its only conference tournament game. Jerome Robinson has scored 20 or more points in eight straight games and an A.C.C.-best 13 times over all, ranking third in conference scoring (20.9), and the freshman Ky Bowman is already an Orange killer, having hit 7 of 8 from beyond the arc in their first meeting.And so it goes for the Orange, whose postseason hopes seem to be teetering.“We did have a lot of potential coming into the year,” said Andrew White, a graduate transfer and the team’s leading scorer. “But potential doesn’t mean much when you don’t execute to get the most out of what you have.”"
"Nicol David, the Serena Williams of Squash, Blends in With U.S. Crowds","Nicol David walked incognito through Grand Central Terminal this week, as if she were just another commuter on her way to Track 25. If this were her native country of Malaysia, David might have been mobbed by worshipers. But this was New York, where the sport of professional squash is paying only a fleeting visit.David was in town to participate in the Tournament of Champions, staged this month at Grand Central for the 20th successive year. Frenetic travelers who strode past the mostly transparent glass court near East 42nd Street did not quite know what to make of it. They were most likely not aware that David is the longtime queen of squash.David’s résumé is nothing short of astounding. After turning professional in 2000 at 17, she won the World Open title eight times and retained the No. 1 ranking for 108 consecutive months, a record streak that ended in July 2015.Now 33, she has dropped to No. 7, but she has been a top 10 player for 152 straight months, nearly 13 years. David is the Serena Williams or Roger Federer of women’s squash, and she shows no sign of quitting.“As long as my body is going to keep me going, I will play,” she said before a practice session Thursday. “As long as you have the heart and the fire and the passion, the willingness to get up and train, do what you want to do, then it can go on as long as you want.”It has been going on decades now for David, a nimble, slim athlete who will play a first-round match Saturday evening against Jenny Duncalf of England. David was spotted by Malaysian scouts in her home state of Penang as a young child and was winning tournaments before she turned 10.Her father, Desmond David, who played on the national soccer team, encouraged her development. Because squash is so respected in Malaysia, Nicol received significant funding from the national sports council. That backing allowed her to relocate to Amsterdam, where her coach, Liz Irving, is based.The council still sponsors David, allowing her to travel with her coach and physical therapist to international tournaments. Endorsements back home and prize money also help her maintain a demanding lifestyle.“I think what this sport gives, you can’t find anywhere else,” David said. “Nothing can match the high of competing and playing for your life on the court. You have to be in it to know it. Being out there and playing your heart out. All the prep and training goes into one great performance and tournament. That’s what you strive for.”Grand Central is certainly one of the more unusual venues for the Professional Squash Association’s world tour. The 10,000-pound portable court is set up in Vanderbilt Hall for about nine days. The court is so close to the 42nd Street entrance that outside weather conditions directly affect the speed of play.“It depends on the cold, on humidity,” David said. “Every day could be different. Today is warmer; everybody is sweating. The last few years it was very cold, the ball was hard and didn’t travel as much. You had to hit it very hard and adapt.”The pro squash tour staged a major outdoor championship last fall adjacent to the pyramids in Egypt, a country where the sport has taken off. David snapped photos of the pyramids on her way to matches so she could later remind herself of the surreal experience.Egyptian players now dominate the sport, the way that Kenyans rule the marathon. The three highest-ranked women, including the No. 1 player, Nour El Sherbini, are Egyptian, as are seven of the nine highest-ranked men.“There is a culture of squash there,” said David, who could meet her rival, El Sherbini, in the third round at the Tournament of Champions. “The kids want to be the next world champion. You can make good money, get a career, be recognized by your country.”While squash is popular in many parts of the world, it would gain a far greater following if it were accepted as an Olympic sport. David has been at the forefront of a campaign to get it included, hoping that it will be adopted by the International Olympic Committee during her lifetime.For now, there is the next tournament, and the one after that. David’s slight build and her fitness level allow her to move more quickly than most competitors, to attack forward and volley aggressively. Although she is losing more often these days, it is not that her game has deteriorated; the sport has evolved and the opponents are better.“When I won my first world title in 2005, when I got to No. 1 in 2006, that level then, the way I played then, would not get me to the qualifying level now,” David said. “My quality has progressed. Every year I’m growing and learning more.”She enjoys comparisons to Federer.“Roger actually played squash before, and you can see the squash influence,” David said. “That’s what I’m claiming, anyway.”While David practiced in relative anonymity at Grand Central on Thursday, there was at least one observer who appreciated her presence. Jahangir Khan was unbeaten in 555 matches, from 1981 to 1986, and is considered squash’s greatest player. He quit at age 29, he said, when he was losing only on rare occasions.“My decision was getting out at the top,” Khan said. “But it’s phenomenal what she did for women’s squash. It’s not easy playing at the top level.”David plays on. And you may want to take note, on your way to Track 25."
"Transgender Bill Could Cost San Antonio $234 Million, Says Study of Final Four","A study for the city of San Antonio predicted that the 2018 Final Four would bring nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in spending to the city, a talking point sure to be raised as debate continues over a proposed Texas law seen by some as discriminatory to transgender people.A similar law in North Carolina prompted the N.C.A.A. and the N.B.A. to pull events from that state.According to a memo obtained Friday by The New York Times and verified by a spokeswoman for the local organizing committee, next year’s Final Four would lead to $135 million in direct spending and a total economic impact, accounting for money spent by tens of thousands of visitors at other businesses, of $234 million.The study, conducted by the chief economist of the Sabér Research Institute, projected state tax revenue of $9.5 million and municipal tax revenue of $4.4 million stemming from the event.Earlier this month, Texas officials, led by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican, proposed legislation that would require transgender people to use bathrooms in government buildings and public schools and universities based on their “biological sex,” overriding any local rules to the contrary (potentially including a nondiscrimination ordinance that, the committee spokeswoman noted, San Antonio has). The proposal is known as Senate Bill 6.Jeff Coyle, San Antonio’s director of government and public affairs, declined to comment on the specifics of the bill. “What it all comes down to,” he said, “is the message we send to the rest of the country as a state: Are we welcoming, are we open for business, or are we restrictive?”The N.C.A.A. has not commented on the Texas bill.The bill strikes many observers as similar to the North Carolina law that prompted the N.C.A.A. to move championship events out of the state, including games in the early rounds of the Division I men’s basketball tournament. The N.B.A. moved its All-Star Game, and the Atlantic Coast Conference moved its football championship game in response to the law.Many of North Carolina’s business interests opposed the law, citing economic downsides. The Texas Association of Business has also opposed the bill, in addition to several groups that represent lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals.The Texas bill appears to have an exemption for venues “privately leased to an outside entity,” which could include a situation such as Houston’s NRG Stadium, which is set to host the Super Bowl early next month (likely before the bill would actually be made law), or the Alamodome come March 2018.It is not clear how such an exemption would affect hotels or restaurants accounted for in the economic impact report. It is also unclear how the N.C.A.A. would assess it. Currently the association quizzes prospective host sites over their abilities to cultivate nondiscriminatory atmospheres."
"A Year After a Title, the Denver Broncos’ Staff Gets an Overhaul","ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — Not even a year ago, members of the Broncos’ coaching staff were riding fire trucks through downtown Denver with the players to celebrate their victory in Super Bowl 50. Now, the staff is undergoing a major overhaul.Vance Joseph, the new head coach, hired Mike McCoy as his offensive coordinator on Friday, and the Broncos will also be getting new defensive and special-teams coordinators. McCoy, the former Chargers head coach, is everything Joseph said he wanted in the play-caller for his offense: creative, energetic, seasoned.“Mike is an experienced play-caller who can build a system around our players,” Joseph said. “It was our goal to find an offensive coordinator who has flexibility with his scheme, and Mike has done that as both a head coach and coordinator. He’s had a lot of success in this league with many different styles of offense, including here with the Broncos.”McCoy, who was Denver’s offensive coordinator from 2009 to 2012, replaces Rick Dennison, whose offense struggled over the last two years under four quarterbacks.During his first stint in Denver, McCoy molded an offense around quarterback Tim Tebow in 2011 that led to an improbable victory over Pittsburgh in the playoffs. The following season, he helped Peyton Manning become comeback player of the year, an honor that as Chargers head coach he helped Philip Rivers win in 2013.Now he will get the chance to mold young quarterbacks — Trevor Siemian and Paxton Lynch.The Broncos, who missed the playoffs after slipping to 9-7 in 2016, find themselves in the unusual position of remaking their staff less than a year after winning it all.General Manager John Elway hired Joseph after Gary Kubiak’s abrupt resignation two weeks ago over health concerns.The defensive coordinator Wade Phillips is finalizing a deal to join the Los Angeles Rams, and the special-teams coordinator Joe DeCamillis was hired by the Jacksonville Jaguars on Friday.Phillips said goodbye to Denver on Twitter, writing: “Thanks to John for bringing me, the greatest staff, to Gary our leader, to the best players ever and to the greatest fans. I will miss you.”His successor is Joe Woods, who spent the last two seasons coaching Denver’s “No Fly Zone” secondary, which produced the No. 1 pass defense each year.Unlike Elway’s first two coaches, John Fox and Kubiak, Joseph, 44, is a first-time head coach. He has just one year of experience as defensive coordinator, last year in Miami, and Elway said he would have to “grow on the run.”So Elway is giving more advice this time around as his head coach hires his staff, and will most likely stay more involved.“I hope I can help him,” Elway said. “With the experience that I’ve had, not only as a player but now in this role I’ve been in as G.M., I’m hoping to help him tremendously.“Vance knows what he wants on offense on his staff and as well as offensively. I can give input. Ultimately, it is Vance’s staff.”Joseph inherits a defense that features the All-Pros Von Miller, Aqib Talib and Chris Harris Jr. but struggled against the run after losing Malik Jackson to free agency and Vance Walker to a knee injury.The Broncos finished 27th in the N.F.L. on offense in 2016. An inability to solve slow starts, leaky line play and poor production in the receiving game outside Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders combined to neutralize the team’s strength on defense."
Leader of Chiefs’ Special Teams Gives the Humble Punt Its Due,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The most important play in football as far as the Kansas City Chiefs are concerned is not a long gain on first down or a defensive stop on third-and-short. It is the punt, the humble drop-kick, and anyone who rebuts this point with Dave Toub does so at his own peril.Toub is the team’s special-teams coordinator, the mastermind behind an elite unit, one that has fueled the Chiefs’ rise to A.F.C. contender and also his own candidacy for head coaching openings.But before Toub directed a group that has dominated field position and returned nine kickoffs or punts for touchdowns during his four seasons in Kansas City, he was a special-teams novice. His first job in that area came during his first season as an N.F.L. coach — in 2001, when his current boss, Andy Reid, hired him as a quality-control assistant to the special-teams coordinator John Harbaugh in Philadelphia.Early conversations with Harbaugh, now a Super Bowl-winning coach in Baltimore, inculcated the magnitude of the punt. Toub, who was the Chicago Bears’ special-teams coordinator for nine seasons after leaving Philadelphia, considers the punt an offensive play, and no other offensive play registers the same consistent impact. It averages more than 40 yards. It flips field position. It determines outcomes.“My philosophy is if you punt well, cover well and play good defense, you’ll be in every game,” Toub said in an interview last week.The Chiefs, who play the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday night in the playoffs, applied that philosophy en route to going 12-4, their best record since 2003, and winning the A.F.C. West for the first time in six seasons. Toub stresses it to newcomers and stalwarts alike, in meeting rooms and on the practice field, until they, too, understand. Twice in Toub’s four seasons, according to data compiled by Football Outsiders, Kansas City has had the best average field position in the N.F.L.“It’s why the best special-teams players are on punt,” said one of them, the rookie defensive back Eric Murray.It is also why every special-teams period at practice begins with punting. Murray and his cohorts allowed the third-fewest yards per return. The punter, Dustin Colquitt, pooched the second-most kicks inside the 20-yard line. The Chiefs’ opponents have the fourth-worst average field position.For good measure, the Chiefs’ punt return unit, led by the rookie speedster Tyreek Hill, produced two touchdowns and the most yards per return.What powers Kansas City’s special teams, rated by Football Outsiders as the second-best unit in the N.F.L. after the Eagles’, is equal parts talent, scheme and trust. It begins with the confidence Reid has in Toub, 54, his friend for more than 30 years. It enables Toub, with almost the entire roster at his disposal, to make decisions with conviction.“I wouldn’t say that other ones in the past have looked over their shoulder like, ‘Is this O.K.?’” said Colquitt, in his 12th season punting for the Chiefs. “But Andy trusts him with the whole deal — this is your thing, put your spin on it. He wants to see the Dave Toub side of this play.”The Toub side manifests itself in subtleties, such as an obsessive emphasis on man-to-man blocking, but also in more audacious moments, such as the fake punt he designed (and called) to perfection in a Week 13 victory in Atlanta or what his former boss in Chicago, Lovie Smith, said would have been “one of the greatest plays of all time” had a penalty not foiled a misdirection masterpiece for a touchdown that bewildered the Green Bay Packers in 2011.“Sometimes you can hit it just right with the personnel in one place,” said Smith, who hired Toub in 2004. “But what Dave’s done is unique. He’s done it twice. Look at what his special teams do.”It was Smith who instilled the attitude that the Bears would win because of their special teams, and with 22 touchdowns on kickoff or punt returns (and only three allowed) during Toub’s tenure, they often did. Special teams are thriving again with Kansas City because the Chiefs prioritize them during the off-season, when they evaluate players, and during the season, when critical practice time is devoted.On Tuesdays after games, special-teams players eagerly await a packet containing grades in multiple categories. They receive points for things like drawing penalties, tackling ball carriers and being the first player downfield on a kickoff. They are docked points for things like missing tackles, committing penalties and not hustling.Toub and his assistant, Brock Olivo, the first recipient of the college special-teams player of the year award in 1997, also assign grades to 350 potential draft picks. They value two qualities above all: instincts and speed.“If you have that combination, you know you’ve got a guy,” Toub said. “The floor is going to be at least a good special-teams player.”If a prospect does not play special teams, Toub and Olivo review his offensive or defensive film and project possible roles. If two receivers or defensive backs are perceived as similar, Toub said, the special-teams mark breaks the tie.Sometimes the next contributor is obvious from the outset, as it was with Murray, who excelled on special teams at Minnesota. Toub loved Murray’s toughness and intelligence, traits that have served him well with the Chiefs, who depend on him both to make blocks and shed them. His aptitude landed him on Pro Football Focus’s All-Pro first team.“A lot of times, we match up against people who weigh 250, 260,” said Murray, listed at 5 feet 11 and 199 pounds, “but even though we’re smaller, Dave always says to punch them in the mouth. We’re relentless.”The constant churn at the bottom of the roster can destroy special-teams continuity, but the Chiefs’ unit has maintained a strong core — Frank Zombo, Anthony Sherman and Daniel Sorenson have played the last three seasons, for instance — supplemented by eager young players who volunteer for assignments.Recent drafts have netted D. J. Alexander, De’Anthony Thomas, Demarcus Robinson and Hill, who has returned three kicks (two punts, one kickoff) for touchdowns. Toub called Hill the fastest player he has ever coached — faster even than Devin Hester, regarded as one of the best returners ever.Toub has been fortunate to be able to deploy Hill (and Hester), but he specifically tells his charges not to expect Hill to depend solely on his physical gifts.“He knows it’s not like a video game, that Tyreek’s not going to make everybody miss,” Colquitt said. “When you go back and look and see how he got to the end zone, it’s because 10 guys are dedicated to blocking for him, doing exactly what was drawn up during the week.”Thirty years ago, those organizational skills appealed to Texas-El Paso Coach Bob Stull, who gave Toub, a two-time all-conference offensive lineman at the university, his first full-time coaching job in strength and conditioning.Unlike many of his peers in that era, Stull said, Toub maintained records of his players’ progress in major lifts, first at UTEP and then at Missouri.It was there, in 1998, where he shifted to coaching football, after the sudden death of Missouri’s defensive line coach. And it was also there, Stull said, where Toub, a gifted carpenter, built a home and started renovating others.Decades later, Toub remains a meticulous craftsman. He just found another outlet."
"Eric Gordon Likes What He Sees, After a Change of Scenery","HOUSTON — At first, it was just a vision. Eric Gordon, a free agent at the time, listened as Mike D’Antoni, the newly installed coach of the Houston Rockets, described his offensive system and how Gordon would fit as an important piece.Gordon, a 28-year-old shooting guard, could begin to see it unfold at that meeting in July: all the transition layups, all the defenders collapsing on James Harden, all the open 3-pointers against opponents that the Rockets had stretched like rubber bands with their unremitting ball movement. D’Antoni made a convincing case.As Gordon said in an interview last week, “Why not take a chance?”Gordon took his mother, Denise, with him when he signed with the Rockets for four years and $53 million — a contract that, halfway through this season, is shaping up as one of the best bargains of last summer’s free-agency period. Gordon has played excellent basketball, and everything that D’Antoni and the team’s front-office pitched to him has come to fruition.In fact, the Rockets, who were 31-11 on the season going into their game on Sunday night against the Nets in Brooklyn, have exceeded even their own expectations.“I think he knew, more or less, the type of basketball we’d be playing, with the free rein on 3-pointers and all that,” D’Antoni said of Gordon. “But I don’t think I could even articulate in the summertime exactly what we’d be doing, because I didn’t know we’d be doing this.”And what is this, exactly? The Rockets, already partial to the 3-point shot before D’Antoni arrived in June, are on pace to obliterate N.B.A. records for 3-pointers attempted and made in a season. But more than merely operating as long-range gluttons, the Rockets are producing quality shots, sinking 37.2 percent of their 3-point attempts going into Sunday night’s game. They were on track to make 1,213 this season.With Harden, a leading candidate for the league’s Most Valuable Player Award, acting as the offense’s guiding force at point guard, Gordon is averaging 17.7 points in 30.6 minutes per game. He is also averaging a career-high 3.7 3-pointers per game, the second most in the league, just behind the Golden State Warriors’ Stephen Curry. Just as significant, Gordon is doing his handiwork while coming off the bench, a role he accepted without apparent reservation when D’Antoni was searching for rotational balance early in the season.“It was just something we were experimenting with to see if it could work out,” Gordon said. “And I’m like: ‘Try it. If we win a whole bunch of games, why not?’”That phrase — why not? — has become something of a verbal tic for Gordon, who seems fully aware by now that so much about his chosen profession is beyond his control. He knows about injuries and outsized expectations. He knows about losing and armchair critics. So he must feel as if he has fallen through storm clouds and landed in basketball nirvana.“I’ve never shot this many 3s,” he said. “Guys are looking for me all the time.”Gordon, a former first-round pick of the Los Angeles Clippers, had spent the past five seasons with the New Orleans Pelicans, joining the team when it was still known as the Hornets. He did not describe his time with that franchise as the most fulfilling phase of his professional career.“It was a rough patch,” he said.Gordon was hindered by injuries from the start, playing only nine games in his first season in New Orleans. He wound up missing a total of 173 regular-season games with issues that included loose cartilage in his right knee, tendinitis in his left knee and a torn labrum in his left shoulder. Last season, he broke his right ring finger — twice.“A lot of freaky stuff,” D’Antoni said. “But he plays very violently — a lot of jerks and starts.”D’Antoni and Gordon already knew one another from their involvement with U.S.A. Basketball. Gordon was among the final players cut from the national team that won the gold medal at the 2012 Olympics, even though D’Antoni said he was “arguably the best player in camp.” But Gordon was coming off an injury-marred season — and vying for a spot with Harden.As he mulled his options in free agency last summer, Gordon identified the Rockets as an appealing destination. Long known as an attack-the-rim guard who absorbed his share of punishment — his Pelicans teammates called him Bulldog — Gordon was not averse to shooting more from the perimeter. Perhaps there was an element of self-preservation involved.Rockets forward Ryan Anderson said, “This is the type of team that saves years on your legs.”The prospect of continuing to play alongside Anderson, a former teammate in New Orleans, was also enticing to Gordon. Both were free agents last summer, and after Anderson signed with the Rockets, he immediately called Gordon to make his pitch.“I just told him how awesome it would be if he came along,” Anderson recalled. “And he told me, ‘I think this might be what I’m going to do.’ He’s so much happier here. You can just tell. He’s so much more talkative. He’s so much more aggressive. Guys have complete faith in him every time he has the ball in his hands.”It has been a season of redemption for the Rockets. Redemption for D’Antoni, whose up-tempo style of offense is wreaking havoc on the rest of the league after he struggled to get it going in previous stops with the Knicks and the Lakers. Redemption for Harden, who has silenced any critics by orchestrating the offense as — wait for it — a pass-first point guard. And redemption for Gordon, who has largely remained healthy and thrived.Gordon, who is naturally on the bulky side, worked to slim down before the season, D’Antoni said. Gordon appeared in the team’s first 39 games of the season before he missed two last week with a sprained toe. No one could blame Gordon — or the Rockets — for wanting to exercise caution, given his injury history.In recent years, Gordon has gone to unique lengths in search of physical well-being. Since 2014, he has augmented his off-season workouts by spending a couple of weeks in Germany each summer training with Bayer Leverkusen, a soccer club in the top-shelf Bundesliga. Gordon, who used to play competitive soccer before choosing to focus on basketball, said he had been introduced to the club by Barrence Baytos, a trainer and neuromuscular therapist based in Los Angeles.“Their stuff over there is very good,” said Gordon, who described lifting heavy weights to increase his explosiveness. “It’s almost like they know your body better than you do.”Dirk Mesch, a spokesman for Bayer Leverkusen, said Gordon had visited the club’s high-class training facility — known as the Werkstatt, or workshop — several times.“Eric fulfilled his personal training and regeneration program,” Mesch said in an email, “and both gave and gained inspiration from the contact with our players.”D’Antoni acknowledged knowing next to nothing about soccer despite having spent much of the 1990s playing and coaching basketball in Italy, but he did say that Gordon’s background in soccer did not surprise him. D’Antoni noted some similarities between Gordon and Steve Nash, who was D’Antoni’s high-octane point guard with the Phoenix Suns and who, like Gordon, has a soccer background.“Eric has that real good footwork,” D’Antoni said.Gordon also has an intuitive feel for spacing, D’Antoni said, and a knack for reading the floor. With the Rockets, Gordon can finally see the possibilities."
UConn Women Win Their 91st Straight and Rewrite History Again,"All that was missing from the Connecticut women’s basketball team’s shattering of its own N.C.A.A.-record winning streak on Saturday was a sense of drama and amazement.Ninety-one victories in a row with no end to the winning in sight?“Honestly, I don’t sit here and figure out how many games we’re going to win in a row,” Coach Geno Auriemma said before the Huskies broke out to a 21-0 lead and obliterated Southern Methodist in Dallas, 88-48, to write the latest chapter in the program’s illustrious history. “We’ve done it before.”From 2008 to 2010, his team, powered by Maya Moore, chased and overtook the 88-game streak set by the U.C.L.A. men’s team in 1974, peaking at 90 straight before losing to Stanford. Given Connecticut’s dominance of the college women’s game — the Huskies have won the last four national titles and a record 11 in all under Auriemma — the notion of another lengthy streak was never a question.But when Connecticut finished an unbeaten season last April by routing Syracuse in the national title game for its 75th straight victory, the widespread belief in women’s basketball circles was that the latest streak would quickly end, and that the next edition of the team could lose multiple games.In the 2016 W.N.B.A. draft, the graduating portion of the UConn roster provided the top three picks, including Breanna Stewart, who was named the most outstanding player all four years she played in the Final Four. Going into this season, the Huskies for once lacked a preseason all-American, and they had an undersized front line, a shallow bench and uncertainty at the all-important point guard position.But they did begin with a belief in the system generated by so much success and by Auriemma, who seldom lacks in self-assurance.“Everybody in the whole country has talked about what we’ve lost,” said Kia Nurse, a junior and two-time national champion. “I personally like playing with a chip on our shoulder.”That chip has turned into a steamrollering boulder. The streak nearly ended on opening night, at Florida State, when the Seminoles had a 3-point shot in the air for the win. The shot fell short, and nobody has pushed the Huskies that hard since.It wasn’t as if they took the path of least resistance to victory No. 91. Auriemma had joked that everyone was eager to schedule Connecticut this season, when seven of its first 12 games were against Top 25 teams, including road games against No. 2 Notre Dame and No. 4 Maryland, and a home game against No. 3 Baylor. Only the Baylor game was close in the final minutes.Along the way, the Huskies have developed a new Big Three, in the sophomores Katie Lou Samuelson and Napheesa Collier and the junior Gabby Williams. They have never lost a game in the American Athletic Conference; their next formidable challenge figures to be a nonconference game at home on Feb. 13 against South Carolina, which is ranked No. 5 in the Associated Press and USA Today Coaches polls.“Women’s basketball is always a little bit under the radar,” Auriemma said after the new record was secured. “But people that follow the game appreciate what this program has done.”If the streak lasts until the South Carolina game, the Huskies will be shooting for a mind-boggling No. 100.“Some things you just can’t really explain,” Auriemma said. “You just have to enjoy it.”"
Falcons Take Advantage of Seattle’s Stumble and Race to N.F.C. Title Game,"ATLANTA — In the playoffs, when the best teams meet, games are often decided by a mistake here or there, or a penalty called or not called. Under Coach Pete Carroll, the Seattle Seahawks have built a reputation of minimizing those mistakes and forcing their opponents to make them instead.But on Saturday, it was the Seahawks who came up short in a divisional-round playoff game against the Atlanta Falcons and their potent offense. The Falcons advanced to the N.F.C. championship game next Sunday, when they will face the winner of this Sunday’s game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Green Bay Packers.The Seahawks were leading, 10-7, when they forced the Falcons to punt early in the second quarter. Seattle’s Devin Hester, who has returned 19 kickoffs and punts for touchdowns during his career, caught the kick, spun away from a defender, then sprinted down the sideline before being knocked out of bounds deep in Falcons territory. The Seahawks appeared poised to build a double-digit lead.But a holding call on Seattle linebacker Kevin Pierre-Louis negated the runback and reversed Seattle’s field position — from the Atlanta 7-yard line to its own 7-yard line — and two plays later, quarterback Russell Wilson fell backward into the end zone for a safety.After the ensuing kickoff, Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan quickly hit receiver Taylor Gabriel for 37 yards. Four plays later, the Falcons kicked a 35-yard field goal to go ahead, 12-10.The quick turnaround unhinged the Seahawks while the Falcons sprinted ahead and captured their first playoff victory in four years, 36-20.After taking the lead in the second quarter, Atlanta’s potent offense had its way with Seattle’s defense — one of the stingiest in the N.F.L. despite missing the star free safety Earl Thomas, who broke his leg in Week 13. Just before halftime, Ryan led a 99-yard march that ended with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Tevin Coleman to put the Falcons up, 19-10.“You knew it was going to be a fight in terms of their defense against our offense,” Falcons Coach Dan Quinn said. “We certainly have the respect of the style they play.”Ryan may not be flashy, but he showed why he is considered a leading candidate to win the N.F.L.’s Most Valuable Player Award. He does not scramble like Wilson or throw fastballs into tight coverage like Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers. But at 6 feet 5 inches tall, he has a wide view of the field to go with an accurate arm.This regular season, his ninth in Atlanta, Ryan passed for 38 touchdowns and nearly 5,000 yards. He had a 69.9 percent pass completion rate and the league’s top passer rating, accomplishments that have often gone unnoticed, perhaps because the Falcons rarely play in prime time.Ryan’s numbers — 26 completions on 37 passes for 338 yards and three touchdowns with zero interceptions — were enough to prompt the Falcons fans to chant “M.V.P., M.V.P.” in the fourth quarter.“It was pretty cool, considering the circumstances,” Ryan said of the cheers.Ryan made few mistakes while Wilson threw two interceptions. Quinn noted that when the Falcons lost to the Seahawks in the regular season, his team had two more turnovers than Seattle. On Saturday, the reverse was true.The Falcons’ defense, one of the most porous in the league during the regular season, overwhelmed Seattle’s offensive line and harassed Wilson, frequently forcing him to scramble. It also bottled up running back Thomas Rawls, who ran effectively early in the game but ended with just 34 yards, 15 fewer than Wilson.After nearly being burned by Hester in the second quarter, the Falcons did a good job of keeping the ball away from him — until he returned a fourth-quarter kickoff all the way to the Atlanta 31-yard line, setting up Seattle’s final touchdown.“A number of us and especially everyone in this room has seen that movie before,” Quinn said of Hester, who played in Atlanta for two years, and his penchant for big plays.In his five years in the league, Wilson has built a reputation for late comebacks. In 2012, his rookie season, Wilson led the Seahawks back from a 20-point deficit in a playoff game, also in Atlanta, only to lose on a late field goal.That magic was not evident on Saturday in front of a raucous crowd at the Georgia Dome.With his team trailing by 29-13, Wilson scrambled free while seeking a receiver. Unable to find one, he decided to do with his feet what he could not with his arm. He raced for the first-down marker only to be hit hard by Atlanta cornerback Brian Poole, who drove his shoulder into Wilson and threw him to the ground.And it was the Falcons’ defense that ultimately provided the capstone.Midway through the fourth quarter, Wilson was again forced to run out of the pocket. In desperation, he lofted a pass downfield that Falcons safety Ricardo Allen plucked out of the air and returned 45 yards. Ryan’s third touchdown pass, a 3-yard toss to Mohamed Sanu, soon put the Falcons up by 36-13 and the game out of reach.The victory may have given Falcons fans one last chance to visit the Georgia Dome, the team’s home since 1992.Next season, the team will move into Mercedes-Benz Stadium, a $1.5 billion palace 90 feet to the south. The Falcons are now 4-2 in playoff games in the Georgia Dome. If the Packers beat the Cowboys in Texas on Sunday, the Falcons will host the N.F.C. championship game here.“For the fans, the ability to come back here one more time, I think that would be something we would all look forward to,” Quinn said."
Hurricanes Rally to Defeat the Islanders,"RALEIGH, N.C. — Brock McGinn had a goal and three assists on Saturday night, Jordan Staal and Elias Lindholm each had a goal and two assists, and the Carolina Hurricanes pulled away late to beat the Islanders, 7-4, for their fourth straight victory.The Hurricanes overcame a 3-1 deficit with three goals in the second period and improved to 14-1-1 in their last 16 home games.Carolina scored three more times in the third to turn the game into a rout, including a goal by Lee Stempniak that broke a 4-4 tie 5 minutes 42 seconds into the period.McGinn has scored in three straight games and has seven points over all in that span.Justin Faulk, Brett Pesce and Teuvo Teravainen also scored for Carolina. Cam Ward made 28 saves.John Tavares scored twice for the Islanders a night after recording a hat trick against the Florida Panthers. Thomas Greiss gave up all seven goals on 43 shots before being pulled.The Hurricanes outshot the Islanders, 45 to 32.The Islanders were in control early. Tavares and Anders Lee scored in the first period, and Jason Chimera made it 3-1 early in the second when he streaked down the middle and buried a pass from Anthony Beauvillier in the left corner of the net.Then the Hurricanes rallied, with help from the Islanders’ defense.Shortly after Chimera’s goal, Faulk launched a wrist shot from the face-off circle. Greiss made the save, but Islanders defenseman Scott Mayfield kicked the rebound through Greiss’s legs and into the net."
Patriots Beat Texans to Reach Sixth Straight A.F.C. Title Game,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — The New England Patriots have accomplished so much under Coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady, but they found something new to achieve on Saturday night at Gillette Stadium. In outlasting the Houston Texans, 34-16, the Patriots set an N.F.L. record for conference dominance and used a rare performance by a running back to get it.The Patriots became the first team in the Super Bowl era to reach the conference championship game six years in a row. And running back Dion Lewis became the first player to score touchdowns on a run, a reception and a kickoff return in a postseason game.It was enough to turn a tight game into another January rout, as the Patriots have done for years in the divisional round. In the previous five seasons, New England won each of its games at this stage in the postseason, all at home, by an average of 16 points. Accordingly, they were 16-point favorites to win on Saturday, the largest spread for any playoff game since 1998.Houston, meanwhile, had never survived this round and had gotten here by beating an Oakland Raiders team that was forced to start its third-string quarterback. The last time the Texans played in New England, the Patriots shut them out behind quarterback Jacoby Brissett. He was inactive on Saturday.The starter this time, of course, was Brady, who missed the first game with the Texans while serving a suspension related to the deflation of footballs here during the 2015 A.F.C. championship game.Brady was coming off a remarkable regular season, averaging nearly 300 passing yards per game, with 28 touchdowns and two interceptions. He matched that interception total on Saturday, but in the end, it did not matter much.Brady threw his first touchdown pass with 9 minutes 27 seconds left in the first quarter, finding Lewis for 13 yards. The Texans then turned an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Eric Rowe into a sustained drive, collecting four first downs but settling for a Nick Novak field goal to make it 7-3.Novak’s ensuing kickoff fell to Lewis at the 2-yard line, but Lewis tore through the Texans, eluding a diving Robert Nelson and dashing untouched into the end zone. It was the first postseason kickoff return for a touchdown in Patriots history and the second score of the quarter for Lewis, who had no touchdowns in the regular season.At that point, the Texans probably needed something strange to happen, and the Patriots provided it. Brady’s first pass of the second quarter bounced off the fingers of wide receiver Michael Floyd and into the arms of cornerback A. J. Bouye. Again, the Texans could manage just a field goal, to make it 14-6.And again, the Patriots would help them out.This time, Lewis’s kickoff return went as poorly as possible. Akeem Dent forced a fumble, and the Texans recovered at the New England 12-yard line. Two plays later, Houston quarterback Brock Osweiler found tight end C. J. Fiedorowicz for a 10-yard touchdown strike.The fans had reason to expect a blowout, but with the Patriots’ lead cut to 14-13, they went quiet. The next two drives brought more cause for concern: Both ended with a sack and a punt. Even the Patriots’ last drive of the half was unfulfilling, ending with a field goal after three plays from inside the 5-yard line.On the Patriots’ second drive of the third quarter, though, Brady connected four times with Julian Edelman, who finished with 137 yards and moved into eighth on the list for postseason receptions in a career. The drive ended with a 19-yard touchdown pass to James White, and New England carried the 24-13 advantage into the fourth quarter.Yet, after five seconds, Novak knocked through a 46-yard field goal, capitalizing on Andre Hal’s interception of Brady late in the third quarter. Novak’s kick made it a one-score game, at 24-16, but the Patriots’ defense soon soothed any anxiety the crowd might have felt.With 13 minutes left in the fourth quarter, Osweiler fired to DeAndre Hopkins, who tipped the ball to Logan Ryan for an interception. Ryan returned it 23 yards to the Texans’ 6-yard line, a devastating blow for Houston. Two plays later, Lewis rumbled into the end zone from 1 yard out.Lewis, who was playing in his first career postseason game, had scored three touchdowns: one receiving, one on a kickoff and one rushing. The last player to do that in a game was Kansas City’s Tyreek Hill this season, and before that, Chicago’s Gale Sayers in 1965."
DirecTV’s Local N.F.L. Blackout Brings Out Angry Rob Lowe,"Rob Lowe has appeared in nearly a dozen DirecTV commercials.So when the actor on Saturday accused the satellite company, as well as his local Fox affiliate, of letting greed interrupt his enjoyment of the N.F.L. playoffs, his outrage drew attention.“Fox and DirecTV have blocked out the Seattle vs. Atlanta game in my area,” Mr. Lowe posted on Twitter, using abbreviations, handles and hashtags where appropriate. “Stop the greed and let the fans see the game!!”The actor went on to parody his DirecTV ads, in which he typically plays two versions of himself: the first, a normal, suave version, happy to be subscribed to DirecTV, and the second, a bizarro version, unhappy to have cable. (Examples of the second type include “crazy hairy Rob Lowe,” “super creepy Rob Lowe” and “poor-decision-making Rob Lowe.”)“Hi, I’m Rob Lowe,” he wrote in a second post. “And I’M “Screwed Over” Rob Lowe, with DirecTV that cuts off my abiliy to watch NFL games during the playoffs!”Mr. Lowe later deleted that tweet, though not before others, whom he eagerly promoted on his own feed, reposted it, with one calling him a “national hero.”“Finally, a celebrity opinion we care to hear!!” another said.Mr. Lowe may have been unable to watch the game because of a dispute between DirecTV and News-Press and Gazette or NPG, a Missouri-based company that owns various network affiliates in Mr. Lowe’s market, as well as dozens of others in the West and the Midwest. The contract between the two companies expired in early January.Disputes such as these are not unusual, and they often cut off coverage of sports events.According to The Desert Sun, Mike Stutz, a general manager at one of the affected stations, said in a statement, “DirecTV refuses to pay a fair value for our programming.” And NPG appealed directly to viewers, setting up a web page to encourage them to demand that DirecTV “get to the negotiating table to settle this dispute.”DirecTV fired back, The Desert Sun reported. Its statement blamed the problems on NPG, saying that the company “has suspended its stations briefly from our customers and threatened others before.”DirecTV, which was acquired by AT&T in summer 2015, is the country’s largest satellite provider, and many of its past advertisements have promoted its extensive professional football programming.Mr. Lowe did not miss much of a game on Saturday. The Falcons defeated the Seahawks with relative ease, 36-20."
Packers. Patriots. Steelers. Falcons. Who Has the Edge?,"Road teams finally found the success they were missing in this season’s playoffs, with Green Bay and Pittsburgh advancing to the conference championships. Both will have to repeat that road success if either team wants to make it to Super Bowl LI in Houston, as the Packers will travel to Atlanta and the Steelers will be on their way to New England.Here’s a quick preview of the conference championships:No. 4 Green Bay Packers (10-6) at No. 2 Atlanta Falcons (11-5)Time: 3:05 p.m. Eastern, FoxSpread: Falcons are favored by 4.They say “defense wins championships,” but the N.F.C. will almost assuredly be decided by which team’s superstar quarterbacks is able to do more damage. Aaron Rodgers has led the Green Bay Packers to eight consecutive wins, repeatedly delivering under intense late-game pressure, and Matt Ryan looks like a completely different player than the one who struggled in recent seasons. Green Bay will be trying to win a a second consecutive playoff game on the road, and Atlanta, after an easy win over Seattle in the divisional round, will be trying to reach the Super Bowl for the first time since the 1998 season.No. 3 Pittsburgh Steelers (11-5) at No. 1 New England Patriots (14-2)Time: 6:40 p.m. Eastern, CBSSpread: Patriots are favored by 6.At one point during the season the Patriots seemed nearly unbeatable, but they have had to work far harder in recent weeks to keep things going. The Steelers, meanwhile, have hit their stride defensively, with an offense led by the usual suspects of Ben Roethlisberger, Le’Veon Bell and Antonio Brown. It will be New England’s 11th appearance in the A.F.C. championship game in the 16 seasons of the Tom Brady Era, and the team will be trying to reach the Super Bowl for the seventh time in that span. The Steelers, who have won two Super Bowls with Roethlisberger, are hoping to make an appearance in the game for the fourth time in 12 seasons.Here’s how all four teams got here:It may not have been the type of game the Pittsburgh Steelers prefer to play, with all of the team’s scoring coming from their kicker’s foot, but in the playoffs a win is a win. And the Steelers’ ugly 18-16 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs was just enough to earn the team a trip to New England to face the Patriots in the A.F.C. championship game.It was a game largely defined by Pittsburgh’s inability to punch the ball into the end zone after moving the ball well between the 20-yard lines. The game’s biggest moment came near the end when Sean Davis, the Steelers’ defensive back whose helmet-to-helmet hit helped set up a late touchdown for Kansas City, was able to help break up the Chiefs’ 2-point conversion attempt that would have tied the game.The Steelers wasted a tremendous effort by running back Le’Veon Bell, who broke his own franchise postseason record by gaining 170 yards on 30 carries. Despite Bell’s success, Pittsburgh was forced to turn to Chris Boswell, the team’s kicker, for a postseason record six field goals, breaking the previous record of five that been accomplished eight times.In an on-field interview after the game, Boswell rejected the notion that he was the team’s newest “Killer B” along with Ben Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown and Bell.“It was just about doing my job,” Boswell said. “Come out here and put it through the yellow pipes and don’t really think too much, don’t think ‘I’m the guy’ or anything.”The Chiefs had started the game well, becoming the first team this season to score against Pittsburgh on an opening drive, but the offense went quiet after that, managing one field goal and one late touchdown which was too little, too late.Pittsburgh’s defense largely eliminated Tyreek Hill, the Chiefs’ versatile offensive weapon. He was limited to 18 rushing yards and 27 receiving yards, serving as a decoy on many of Kansas City’s plays.The Steelers will now go on the road against New England trying to earn its fourth trip to the Super Bowl in the Ben Roethlisberger era.“I think it’s going to be a showdown,” Bell said in a televised interview. “Obviously, two great quarterbacks going head-to-head, two of the best teams in the A.F.C., so it’s time to settle it next week.”The Green Bay Packers could not hold on to a huge early lead, but in the game’s final seconds Aaron Rodgers was given one more chance to score, and his long completion to Jared Cook set up Mason Crosby’s game-winning 51-yard field goal in a 34-31 victory over the Dallas Cowboys that earned the Packers a trip to the N.F.C. championship game next week against Atlanta.After a string of boring playoff blowouts this season, all won by home teams, Green Bay bucked the trend in a thrilling game in which the Packers raced to a 21-3 lead only to slowly let Dallas back into the game. The Cowboys tied it up at 28-28 before the teams traded long field goals, with Crosby’s 56- and 51-yard makes beating out the 52-yarder from Dan Bailey that nearly resulted in overtime.There were offensive fireworks on both sides, as Rodgers threw for 356 yards and 2 touchdowns while Dak Prescott, the Cowboys’ Cinderella story at quarterback, threw for 302 yards and 3 touchdowns. While Rodgers walked away with the win, Prescott showed exactly why the team confidently kept him as the team’s starter even after longtime starter Tony Romo was declared healthy.In the end, however, Rodgers had just enough to overcome Dallas’ furious comeback. He rattled the Cowboys’ defense all game, catching them moving too slowly on substitutions, taking advantage of penalties, and deftly avoiding the rush to set up passing plays. And on the final drive, when his team needed him most, he found Cook downfield for a shocking 35-yard gain that set up Crosby’s game-winner. Cook just barely got his feet down before going out of bounds, with the play requiring a review after officials disagreed about whether or not he made the catch.Rodgers was all smiles in an on-field interview after the game, saying the game was fun. But when asked about what he was thinking as his long pass to Cook was reeled in, he gave all the credit to Cook.“It was a great catch by Jared,” Rodgers said, adding “It’s just kind of schoolyard at times late in the game like that.”Rodgers was forced to play the entire game without his top wide receiver, Jordy Nelson, but he was able to succeed thanks to strong games from Cook, Davante Adams and Randall Cobb. Ty Montgomery, the wide receiver-turned-running back, chipped in with 11 carries for 47 yards and 2 touchdowns, while also catching 6 passes for 34 yards.That the game was left to Crosby’s strong right leg may have worried some Packers fans, but the veteran kicker had an incredible final four minutes of the game. His 56-yard make set a franchise playoff record, and he had to make the 51-yard attempt twice as Dallas used a timeout to erase his first attempt. While the game-winner was a fairly low kick, it easily made it over the crossbar, completing the Green Bay victory.Green Bay has now won eight consecutive games after Rodgers vowed to “run the table” following the team’s loss to Washington in Week 11. While the quarterback’s long streak without an interception finally ended in the second half, he continued to show off the M.V.P. form that had eluded him in the first half of the season.The loss ended what had been a remarkable season for Dallas, a team that captured the No. 1 seed in the N.F.C. despite losing Romo during the preseason and being forced to hand over the offense to Prescott, a fourth-round draft pick who few expected to play, let alone start. But Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott, along with some tremendous play by the team’s offensive line, formed an offense that few could keep up with.As the No. 4 seed in the conference, Green Bay will travel to face the No. 2-seeded Falcons in Atlanta next Sunday.■ Matt Ryan led the Atlanta Falcons to a 36-20 win over the Seattle Seahawks and heard choruses of “M.V.P.! M.V.P.!” which seemed justified by his 338-yard, three-touchdown performance. That his return to the playoffs was a huge success against Seattle’s Legion of Boom secondary was quite an accomplishment, though it comes with the asterisk of Earl Thomas having missed the game. Thomas, the All-Pro safety, was sorely missed, especially on a 53-yard catch-and-run by running back Devonta Freeman, who executed a fake that left Thomas’s replacement, Steven Terrell, grasping at air as he fell to the turf.■ The Houston Texans’ defense was the only thing keeping the team together all season, and the unit did its best in a lopsided loss to the New England Patriots in which the team intercepted Tom Brady twice but also saw Dion Lewis become the first player in the Super Bowl era to score touchdowns on a run, a pass and a kickoff return in a playoff game. The top-ranked Houston defense got little help from Brock Osweiler, the team’s quarterback who seemed to change a few minds last week, then reminded everyone of his flaws with three interceptions on Saturday. Even with a 34-16 victory for the Patriots, the game showed a great number of flaws for New England going forward. Pretty or not, the Patriots are headed to the team’s 11th conference championship game in the last 16 seasons."
"As Australian Open Begins, Match Fixing Still Casts a Shadow","MELBOURNE, Australia — A year ago, opening day at the Australian Open was overshadowed by the publication of a report that raised concerns about potentially widespread match fixing in tennis.On Monday, organizers tried again to host the Open without the focus being diverted, despite a recent series of sanctions against lower-tier professional players.The site of the Open, Melbourne Park, has undergone significant transformations, as is now customary. The changes for 2017 include the demolition of the main public entrance to Rod Laver Arena and the construction of a pedestrian bridge into the grounds from the banks of the Yarra River. There is also a revamped fan zone dedicated to the four Grand Slam cities. The Paris Quarter features a miniature Eiffel Tower and a gate that looks like one of Hector Guimard’s metro entrances. The New York section contains faux graffiti murals and a hot-dog stand.Widely known as the Happy Slam, the Australian Open is also clearly the Busy Slam. The tournament drew a record 720,363 spectators in 2016 and is aiming to surpass that this year.There are notable absentees: Juan Martín del Potro in the men’s tournament; Madison Keys, Victoria Azarenka, Petra Kvitova and the still-suspended Maria Sharapova in the women’s event. But there are plenty of stars to populate the main show courts under their retractable roofs. They include two 35-year-olds: Serena Williams and Roger Federer, who is back for his first official competition after a six-month injury break.Federer, seeded just 17th this year, will fall lower in a hurry if he does not come close to matching his semifinal run in Melbourne last year, when he arrived healthy and departed with a knee in need of surgery. (He heard an ominous click post-tournament while running a bath for his children.)He said the report that surfaced on opening day last year, which has not led to any major revelations, had taken him by surprise.“I just find it unjustified when you come out and say there’s match fixing going on, but if you don’t have proof, it’s always super hard,” Federer said in a recent interview. “I expected much more to come out of it from Australia than just accusations, to be quite honest.”The report did prompt the appointment of an independent review panel, which is in the later stages of investigating tennis’s anticorruption program, including the Tennis Integrity Unit, the game’s internal watchdog. David Haggerty, president of the International Tennis Federation, said Monday in a telephone interview from Indonesia that the panel was expected to deliver its interim report “in the next couple months” and its final report “by the end of the year, hopefully by the beginning of the third quarter.”Haggerty and other leaders of the sport’s numerous governing bodies are funding the inquiry and have agreed to put in place and pay for all of its recommendations.“I’m sure it will be a very thorough process, but the key for us, for me and the I.T.F., is we’re not going to wait for a final report to make improvements,” Haggerty said.Tennis Australia, the country’s governing body for the sport, has already made moves, creating its own integrity unit and increasing player education and oversight. It also has reduced its sponsorship agreement with William Hill, a bookmaker whose logo is no longer on display on courts at this year’s Australian Open.The Tennis Integrity Unit also has made significant changes ahead of the review panel’s report. Its staff has doubled to 10 employees, and its annual budget has been increased to $3.23 million this year from $2.4 million in 2016. It imposed sanctions on nine players and officials in 2016 — the most in any year in its history. Those penalized included two match officials from Turkey and two from Uzbekistan, all given lifetime bans for manipulating and selling scoring data to gamblers.In an effort to be more transparent, the Tennis Integrity Unit has also begun regularly releasing information about its activities.“We’re trying to make subtle changes to address these issues,” said Chris Kermode, the executive chairman and president of the ATP, “but it seems fairly evident that the issue is at the lower ranks, and that is going to be the challenge going forward.”The vast majority of the match-fixing cases in tennis have occurred at the Futures level, the lowest level of professional tennis, where live scoring and data have allowed gamblers to place bets on in-match developments and not just on final results. Haggerty said the I.T.F. had increased its monitoring and was instituting credentialing restrictions and putting more monitors at match sites. But he said the sport was also considering a possible restructuring of lower-level circuits, including the Futures, in an attempt to reduce the scope of potential cheating and to provide a clearer pathway for talented young players.The police in Australia and Spain have charged lower-tier players with match fixing in the last year. This month, the Tennis Integrity Unit barred the now-retired Australian player Nick Lindahl for seven years and fined him $35,000 for agreeing to throw a match at a Futures tournament — the lowest level of professional tennis — in Toowoomba, Australia, in 2013.The most troubling recent case in Australia was on Jan. 5, when the police in the state of Victoria charged Oliver Anderson, 18, the reigning Australian Open boys’ champion, with engaging in match fixing during a Challenger tournament in Traralgon in October.The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Anderson had been approached about throwing the first set of a first-round match against another Australian player, Harrison Lombe. Anderson lost the first set, 4-6, and then went on to win the next two sets, 6-0, 6-2.“I think some of the recent announcements confirm the commitment tennis has to the integrity of the game,” Haggerty said. “I think it shows that the system is working, and I think investing in more investigators with the T.I.U. has increased the strength and is helping, but honestly, one match-fixing incident is too much. We have to have a zero tolerance.”"
"Conservationist Bud Lilly, ‘a Trout’s Best Friend,’ Dies at 91","Bud Lilly, a fly fisherman and conservationist whose fervent advocacy of catch and release inspired people to call him “a trout’s best friend,” died on Jan. 4 in Bozeman, Mont. He was 91.His son Michael said the cause was heart failure.Mr. Lilly began fishing as a young boy in Manhattan, Mont., where he was influenced by his father’s tales of trout fishing in his native California. After his father closed up his barbershop for the day, the two of them would fish.In time, Mr. Lilly’s youthful fascination with trout became a life’s work. He became a guide on the Madison, Gallatin and Yellowstone rivers; the owner of a renowned trout shop in West Yellowstone, Mont.; and an author, preaching the joys of casting artificial flies into rivers and streams.“I was always engaged by the instant of the strike,” he wrote in his autobiography, published in 1988. “It doesn’t matter how many thousands of trout I’ve taken since. I still have the same excitement when I put a fly over a trout and a miracle happens.”And, until the early 1960s, he viewed trout as a reward to be eaten, not as a natural resource that could be imperiled.“Life was simple,” he wrote. “You caught a big fish; you killed it. Only an idiot would let it go.”But he eventually changed his mind. He heard about catch and release from fishermen from Michigan and made it his cause, reasoning that the popularity of fly-fishing in Montana might deplete the stocks of trout. He created a catch-and-release club in his shop, selling fishermen silver buttons that boasted of their releases of trout of various lengths.“The club caught on and a lot of anglers wore one or more buttons on his/her vest,” Paul Schullery, a friend who co-wrote Mr. Lilly’s books, said in an email. “Presumably, the button kind of replaced the trout as the ‘trophy.’”Mr. Lilly’s reputation in Montana as a fisherman, retailer and outfitter helped persuade reluctant anglers that they could change their behavior.“He had a megaphone, and people picked up on what he said,” Bruce Farling, executive director of Montana Trout Unlimited, a conservation group, said in an interview. “He wasn’t the only voice, but he was probably the most prominent one.”Mr. Lilly’s efforts were noticed by Arnold Gingrich, a founder of Esquire magazine, who called Mr. Lilly “a trout’s best friend” in his 1973 book “The Joys of Trout.” Mr. Lilly used that nickname as the title of his autobiography.Walen Francis Lilly II was born in Manhattan, Mont. — “on the kitchen table,” he said — on Aug. 13, 1925, to Walen Lilly, a barber, and the former Violet Collins, a homemaker.Fishing and baseball were young Bud’s passions. As a teenager, he played for a local men’s baseball team against a squad of black players, and, as he told the story, hit a single off the legendary pitcher Satchel Paige. He was talented enough, he said, to attract the attention of the Cincinnati Reds. But service in the Navy during World War II interrupted his baseball dreams.He later graduated from Montana State University and became a high school biology teacher. He gave up teaching only after his fly-fishing catalog business took off in the 1970s. He owned Bud Lilly’s Trout Shop for more than 30 years until his wife, the former Patricia Bennett, who was his partner in the venture, got sick in 1981. He sold the shop in 1982; she died in 1984. The shop has changed owners a few times since then, but it has continued to bear his name.Mr. Lilly’s conversion to catch and release was one element of his conservation work. He also worked to end Montana’s practice of planting hatchery trout in rivers — which let fishermen increase their catches — to allow wild trout to thrive.In recent years, Mr. Lilly’s vision was diminished by macular degeneration, and he could no longer fish.“But he’d sit on the bank with lots of advice,” his son Michael said.In addition to Michael, he is survived by another son, Gregory; a daughter, Annette Lilly Russ; a stepson, Chris Lilly; a stepdaughter, Alisa Flores; his second wife, the former Esther Neufeld; five grandchildren; and two step-grandchildren.Mr. Lilly was known as a raconteur whose conversations often began with a joke. Last year, his stepson told his Facebook followers to visit him for a chat on the porch of his father’s home, a converted boardinghouse, in Three Forks, Mont.“Chances are he’s out front, taking in some vitamin D,” Chris Lilly wrote, “and waiting for a chance to talk about fishing or what it was like to be an officer in the Navy at age 19 during WWII.”"
"Andrew Ladd, and the Islanders, Try to Find Their Footing","EAST MEADOW, N.Y. — Andrew Ladd joined the Islanders last summer with a seven-year contract worth $38.5 million and hefty expectations that he would help the franchise improve on last season’s 100-point finish and second-round playoff appearance.But halfway through a vexing campaign, Ladd has only eight goals and 12 points, and the Islanders are in last place in the Eastern Conference at 16-17-8 heading into Monday afternoon’s road game against the Boston Bruins.Ladd did not score his first goal with the Islanders until Game 14, on Nov. 7, and had only three goals in the first 25 contests. He scored four times in a four-game stretch at the end of December, but Ladd, a 6-foot-3 left wing, has no points in the Islanders’ first five games in January.“I honestly don’t think I started that bad — I just couldn’t put the puck in the back of the net, and it kind of snowballed from there,” said Ladd, who scored more than 20 goals in five of his previous six seasons. “Obviously, we’d like to have had a much better start, so it’s been a grind trying to keep the confidence up to find my place.”The same can be said for the Islanders, who are facing a major uphill battle in the second half of the season to stay close to the playoff pack in a tough Metropolitan Division dominated by Columbus, Pittsburgh, Washington and the Rangers.Because they have already had their league-mandated five-day break, the Islanders have played fewer games than some conference rivals, so a winning streak of any consequence could get them back into the race.The addition of Ladd after the longtime Islanders Kyle Okposo and Frans Nielsen signed elsewhere signaled that under the new owners Jon Ledecky and Scott Malkin, the team was willing to spend significant amounts on free agents. Ladd, at $8 million, is the Islanders’ highest-paid player this season.Picked fourth overall in 2004, by the Hurricanes, Ladd won the Stanley Cup with Carolina in 2006 and with Chicago in 2010. After five-plus seasons as captain of the Atlanta Thrashers and then the Winnipeg Jets, he was traded back to Chicago at last season’s deadline before becoming a free agent.Ladd said moving to Long Island had been a pleasant revelation. He has grown to enjoy the 45-minute train rides with teammates from Garden City to Barclays Center in Brooklyn and the proximity to Manhattan.“You don’t understand what life is like on the island until you have a chance to be here,” Ladd said. “Having a family and kids, it’s a great place.”Ladd has also found a groove lately on a line with the speedy playmaker Alan Quine and the rugged winger Jason Chimera, 37, who also signed with the Islanders in July as a free agent. But Coach Jack Capuano has also played Ladd with Brock Nelson and another struggling forward, Ryan Strome, in recent games.“Our pace makes us tick,” Ladd said. “Alan is highly underrated with his skill level and speed. And Chimer has been around a long time. He plays a strong north-south game, so you know what to expect. And he can score.”Chimera, who played for the Washington Capitals the past seven seasons and is closing in on 1,000 career games, said that he and Ladd had needed time to adjust to new surroundings and that playing on the same unit had been a positive step.“We were both struggling, so putting us together could maybe get us going,” said Chimera, who had seven goals and seven assists entering Monday’s game. “Ladder is good at using my speed. He likes to shoot, and I like to get in on the forecheck. We play off each other’s strengths.”When Ledecky and Malkin took control last summer from the longtime owner Charles Wang, there was fresh optimism after the Islanders’ six-game win over Florida in the playoffs. It was the first playoff series win for the franchise since 1993.But victories did not come at the same rate as a season earlier as the Islanders started 6-10-4. The team’s fortunes were not helped by the muddle of having three goaltenders on the roster until Jaroslav Halak, who is still owed more than $7 million, was waived and sent to Bridgeport of the American Hockey League last month.The Islanders are 10-7-4 since Nov. 25, including Saturday’s 7-4 loss at Carolina after Friday’s 5-2 win at Florida, the latest example of their exasperating inconsistency.“We just have to stick with it,” right wing Cal Clutterbuck said. “You can’t look at the standings. Just go play.”Ladd finished last season with 25 goals with the Jets and the Blackhawks. His leadership skills, production and size made him a desirable target for General Manager Garth Snow.Having an extra voice of experience in the locker room is welcome to John Tavares, the team’s 26-year-old captain. Tavares leads the Islanders with 16 goals and 32 points.“Andrew has his own personal makeup for how he handles things,” Tavares said. “He’s got a good sense of when to speak and when to step up.”Capuano, who has guided the Islanders to the postseason in three of the past four years, said Ladd and his teammates had room to improve with 41 games left.“We need a little bit more from all our guys, to be honest with you,” Capuano said.There is ample time on the schedule to make up ground in the standings, but the Islanders play the majority of their remaining games on the road, where they have only five wins so far.“I’ve learned over the course of my career to show up and do the right things day in and day out and lead by example,” Ladd said. “At the end of the year, you want to look back and feel like you produced and contributed.”"
"Restoring an Atmosphere, if Not Yet an Aura, in Manchester","MANCHESTER, England — In the last five minutes of a nerve-shredding 1-1 draw on Sunday, as his team swarmed forward and Liverpool seemed to tilt and teeter, Manchester United Manager José Mourinho got what he wanted.He had asked his club’s fans — so frequently accused of sitting on their hands, waiting to be entertained — to create a “special atmosphere” for the visit of Liverpool.“My invitation is not to come to the theater,” he said a few days before the arrival of Liverpool, United’s fiercest, bitterest rival. “Come to play with us.”Demanding more of your own fans is something like crossing the Rubicon. They pay substantial sums of money to support your team — their team — and sacrifice substantial amounts of time, too. They do not, as a rule, respond kindly to being told they are not meeting expectations.Mourinho knows that well: In 2014, he tried the same move with Chelsea after a particularly quiet game at home against Queens Park Rangers. A few days later, at a Champions League game in Slovenia, the 642 Chelsea followers who had made the long journey spoke for thousands more when they informed Mourinho, on the touchline, that they did not take requests.“We’ll sing when we want” was one of the more genteel offerings that evening.That Mourinho risked repeating the trick last week suggests that he knew that little separated the current incarnations of England’s two most successful clubs, that every slight advantage had to be sought, any source of help called in.For a while, it seemed as if the effort might backfire. With Liverpool leading, the home crowd at Old Trafford started to simmer with resentment. Much of the frustration seemed to focus on Paul Pogba, who was enduring the sort of afternoon that the world’s most expensive player is apparently not permitted.And then Zlatan Ibrahimovic equalized, and all of that acid, anxiety and discontent turned to belief and hope.The stands seemed to shake with noise — guttural, heartfelt, desperate. It might not have led to a winning goal, but it left an impression.“It was really loud when they scored the goal,” said Jürgen Klopp, the Liverpool manager. Mourinho had gotten what he wanted. Old Trafford had found its voice.Atmosphere, though, should not be mistaken for aura. That is what has been missing from this stadium for three years, and what Mourinho has been expected to restore.He knows that, of course. As he said a couple of days before this game, there is no such thing as an “intimidating” atmosphere in elite sports, no matter how loud, no matter how frenzied. The players are too single-minded, too experienced, for that.There is, though, such a thing as an intimidating venue, a place that can overwhelm even the hardest heart and the coolest mind.That is what Old Trafford used to be, when United was in its pomp. Both Steve Bruce and Mark Hughes — managers themselves now, and alumni of Sir Alex Ferguson’s first great United team — use the same phrase to describe the sensation. “Teams,” they have said, “were beaten in the tunnel.”The recollections of visiting players suggest that impression is not rooted in arrogance. Robbie Earle, who came here a number of times during his peripatetic playing career, confessed that his primary concern when facing United at its peak had been to “get out of here without a hiding.”“It was never acknowledged, but not many people would complain if they could walk away from Ferguson’s Old Trafford having lost by one or two goals,” he said.It took Ferguson years — a decade, at least — to imbue this stadium with that aura. His successors needed just two, if that, to wash it away.Under David Moyes and Louis van Gaal, Old Trafford lost something. Teams no longer arrived desperate to keep the score to a minimum, or left happy if they had simply given a good account of themselves. They came not with hope that they might record a victory, but with belief that they could.Mourinho is starting to undo that perception. United has had its blips this season — draws at home with Burnley and Stoke and West Ham, a painful loss to Manchester City — but since Mourinho’s humiliating return to Chelsea in October, something seems to have clicked. United had won its last six games before Liverpool came to town and had avoided defeat for 15.The quality of performance varied, but United had rediscovered a knack for dispatching relative small fry with a minimum of fuss. This game seemed to serve as a genuine test of how far Mourinho’s team had come. It ended, though, as proof of how far there is still to go.Liverpool knows what it is like to lose an aura. For years, teams lost in the tunnel at Anfield, too, crumbling at the sight of that famous sign.And then, 26 years ago or so, it went. The noise remained — though that, too, has been in abeyance for some time — but the effect was different. At times, the pressure seemed to inhibit the hosts and inspire the visitors.Even now, with a towering new stand and a rabble-rousing manager, Anfield is not what it was. As much as neither team would appreciate the comparison, what Liverpool faced after the collapse of its empire remains the most fitting — if by no means perfect — parallel for the post-Ferguson United. And Liverpool’s experience would suggest the magic, once banished, never returns, not quite.Mourinho does not believe that. He cannot believe that. He is employed, specifically, to disprove it.He remains some way from achieving it, though: Even with a starting 11 weakened by the absence of four key players, Liverpool did not show a flicker of fear here, even in those last five minutes, as the noise rumbled and echoed and crashed onto the pitch, as Mourinho got what he wanted.Old Trafford had found its voice. That is the first step. The fans did what was asked of them — they brought the atmosphere. Now it is Mourinho’s turn: to build a team so intimidating, so ruthless, that games are won and lost in the pregnant silence of the tunnel."
Carmelo Anthony Speaks About His Future After Knicks Roll Over,"The Knicks’ steady descent into chaos continued Sunday afternoon in Toronto, where forward Carmelo Anthony punctuated the team’s blowout loss to the Raptors by lashing out at the team’s management.Anthony opened the door to a possible departure from the Knicks by telling reporters that if Phil Jackson, the team president, no longer wanted him around, then it was a “conversation we should have.”Anthony’s comments came in response to questions from reporters about a column by Charley Rosen, a former assistant coach under Jackson and a longtime Jackson confidante, that was published on the website FanRag. In the column, Rosen wrote that Anthony had “outlived his usefulness in New York,” that his legs were “going, going, almost gone” and that Anthony would be willing to waive the no-trade clause in his contract to land with a contender.On Sunday, after the Knicks trailed the Raptors by as many as 38 points in falling, 116-101, at Air Canada Centre, Anthony said that he remained committed to the Knicks and denied that he had even considered waiving his no-trade clause. At the same time, he seemed to suggest that the views in Rosen’s column could have come directly from team officials.“Listen, if that’s how they feel, if that’s coming from that side, then that’s what’s coming from that side,” Anthony told reporters. “I haven’t thought once about that, to be honest with you. I hear it. I hear all the rhetoric that’s going on out there.”The last time Jackson spoke to the reporters who regularly cover the team was in the preseason. His most recent public comments came via Twitter on Dec. 27, when he announced the end of his romantic relationship with Jeanie Buss, the president of the Los Angeles Lakers.Jackson has otherwise remained silent throughout his team’s recent struggles. The Knicks have lost 10 of their last 12 games, a miserable stretch that has featured no shortage of drama — underscored by point guard Derrick Rose’s unexcused absence from a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans last week. Jackson has not commented on that situation, either.At the midway point of the season, the Knicks are 18-23 and several games out of playoff contention.Anthony, 32, whose contract with the Knicks runs through the 2018-19 season, is averaging 22 points a game while shooting 42.6 percent from the field. There have been a number of games when he has carried the team, but he has appeared to show his age in others.Anthony and Jackson have not had the best working relationship this season. In December, Anthony was annoyed after Jackson criticized him in an interview with CBS Sports Network for sometimes holding on to the ball too long.Eventually, the two met in Los Angeles during a trip to smooth things over. But now an even bigger rift may have opened."
James Harden’s Triple-Double Helps Rockets Blow by Nets,"James Harden had 22 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in his 12th triple-double of the season, and the visiting Houston Rockets easily ended their first losing streak of the season by beating the Nets, 137-112, on Sunday night.Held to 105 points in losses to Minnesota and Memphis, the Rockets bounced back with 104 after three quarters and handed the Nets their 10th straight loss.Eric Gordon led the Rockets with 24 points, and Trevor Ariza added 23. Houston made 21 3-pointers and had five players with at least 16 points.Trevor Booker scored 18 points for the Nets, who were still without Jeremy Lin (strained left hamstring) on the night they gave out his bobblehead doll and also rested Brook Lopez.Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 14 points, and Randy Foye scored 13, a season high.Houston shot just 40.8 percent during its two losses, well below its season average of 46.8, while being held nearly 10 points below its season scoring average. But the Rockets had no trouble bouncing back against the Nets, who allow 114.3 per game, the most in the N.B.A.“We just could never stop them,” Nets Coach Kenny Atkinson said. “I don’t think we stopped them the whole night.”The Rockets matched their season high with a 74-point first half, though the Nets stayed close and trailed by only 8 points. Houston opened the third quarter with a 13-2 run to build an 87-68 cushion that grew to 20 later in the period when Harden found Sam Dekker with an alley-oop pass.Ariza, just 1 for 6 from 3-point range in the Rockets’ loss to the Grizzlies on Friday, was 6 for 10 on Sunday. Harden, Gordon and Patrick Beverley all made four.“It’s just about rhythm, and tonight, our rhythm was there,” Ariza said."
Sevilla Ends Real Madrid’s Remarkable Run,"Sevilla twice scored late — including an 85th-minute own goal by Sergio Ramos — to end visiting Real Madrid’s 40-game unbeaten streak, 2-1, on Sunday and move to a point behind Real Madrid atop the Spanish league.Ramos, a native of Seville who previously played for his home club, delighted the Sevilla fans when he found his own net with a header while trying to clear a cross. Stevan Jovetic then scored the winner two minutes into injury time, giving Madrid its first defeat since a 2-0 loss at Wolfsburg in April in the quarterfinals of the Champions League.EVERTON BLASTS MANCHESTER CITY Everton thrashed suddenly free-falling Manchester City, 4-0, a defeat that threatened to drop the visitors out of contention for the Premier League title.Manchester City finished the weekend out of the Premier League top four, 10 points behind first-place Chelsea.Justin Williams and Matt Niskanen each scored two goals, and Philipp Grubauer stopped all 24 shots he faced as the Washington Capitals extended their winning streak to nine games in authoritative fashion by crushing the visiting Philadelphia Flyers, 5-0.The Capitals came alive with four goals on seven shots in the first seven minutes of the third period.Washington, which leads the N.H.L. with 63 points, has outscored its opponents by 40-11 during the streak. Andre Burakovsky also scored a power-play goal for the Capitals, who have not allowed an even-strength goal in six games.Kent Bazemore scored 24 points, Mike Dunleavy added 20 in his second game since he arrived in Atlanta in a trade, and the Hawks beat the visiting Milwaukee Bucks, 111-98, for their eighth win in nine games.Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with 33 points for the Bucks, who have lost three of their last five.Dunleavy, who was traded to Atlanta last week by Cleveland, had his first 20-point performance since a first-round playoff game for Chicago on April 30, 2015.Graeme Storm beat Rory McIlroy on the third playoff hole to win the South African Open in Johannesburg for his second European Tour title 80 days after he lost his card.McIlroy rallied from three strokes down to force a playoff. But he missed his own par putt after the 251st-ranked Storm tapped in on the 18th at the Glendower Golf Club.Storm had lost his tour card at the end of last year by 100 euros but was able to remain on when another player failed to play enough events."
"In N.F.L. Playoffs, 4 Elite Quarterbacks Are Left Standing","Brady. Rodgers. Roethlisberger. Ryan.As in most years, the N.F.L. conference championships include four strong teams. But this year they also include four elite quarterbacks.Matt Ryan of the Falcons, Tom Brady of the Patriots and Aaron Rodgers of the Packers were first, second and fourth in the key statistic of adjusted yards per passing attempt. The four remaining quarterbacks, including Ben Roethlisberger of the Steelers, were first, second, sixth and seventh in passing touchdowns, despite Brady missing four games for his deflation suspension and Roethlisberger missing two because of injury.The starters occupy four of the six Pro Bowl slots for quarterbacks, joined by Derek Carr of the Raiders and Dak Prescott of the Cowboys. They also are all paid more than $20 million a year. (Prescott makes a rookie salary of $680,000.)It is not always the case that the final four includes only top quarterbacks. Last season, the Super Bowl was won by a team, the Broncos, carried almost entirely by its defense. Its quarterback, the faded superstar Peyton Manning, ranked 48th in adjusted yards per pass and 45th in touchdown percentage among quarterbacks who started a game.This year’s quartet starts with Brady and Rodgers, who along with Manning are considered the best quarterbacks of their era. Which one has been better? You can go back and forth with dueling statistics as long as you like.Brady ranks second among active passers in touchdowns to Drew Brees, with Rodgers sixth. But Rodgers, who has played fewer seasons, has more touchdowns per game. Rodgers also ranks first in adjusted yards per pass, with Brady fourth. Rodgers has one Super Bowl win, while Brady is going for a record fifth this season.Of the four quarterbacks, Roethlisberger had the least impressive numbers this year, although they were far from bad. While few would put him at the level of Brady and Rodgers, his career numbers are not too far behind. He is fifth in career touchdown passes and fourth in yards among active players. He has two Super Bowl titles. Despite initial reports that he would miss four to six weeks with a torn meniscus in October, he ended up sitting out just two games.The breakthrough season this year came from Ryan. At age 31 and in his ninth year as a starter, he put up career highs in touchdowns and yards and a career low in interceptions. After establishing a fairly consistent adjusted yards-per-pass figure of about 7 every year, he jumped up to 10.1 this year. He is also considered the front-runner to be the N.F.L.’s most valuable player, just ahead of Rodgers and Brady.If the lines are to be believed, the Super Bowl will pit the veteran Brady (a 6-point favorite over Roethlisberger and the Steelers) and the upstart Ryan (4 points over Rodgers and the Packers).Team success always reflects glory on a quarterback. Terry Bradshaw, Ken Stabler and Joe Namath all made the Hall of Fame based on their teams’ playoff heroics, though their raw numbers were not always sensational. No matter what combination makes the final game this year, the final four signal callers are all backing up their team success with individual achievement."
"Knicks Juggle Starting Lineup, but the Result Is Familiar","As the final seconds of another loss wound down at Madison Square Garden on Monday afternoon, the Knicks put up one shot after another — three in all, any one of which could have given them a victory.But none fell, and as the Atlanta Hawks raced down the court with the ball and the final buzzer sounded, the Knicks painted a portrait of a team stuck in disarray.Carmelo Anthony stood by the team’s bench in the far corner, having missed one of the final three attempts, chagrined again at another defeat. Jeff Hornacek, the coach, waved his arms feebly on the sideline, trying to draw the attention of the referees for a call before the final horn. And Joakim Noah chased the ballhandler, Thabo Sefolosha, in vain, as if mere effort could save the Knicks.But it would take much more to correct the Knicks’ manifold troubles. Triaging them is a test of steel and prioritization: There is a superstar, Anthony, who feels the need to insist he is not in a feud with the front office; there is a leaky defense that appears to be beyond repair; and now there is a burbling of dissatisfaction after a lineup switch that Hornacek hoped could bring about a changing tide.Amid all that, the Knicks continue to lose in an unnerving manner. In a matinee on the holiday that honors the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., they fell, 108-107, to the Hawks, who were without a resting Dwight Howard. The Knicks have now lost 11 of their last 13 games — but are still only three games out of the East’s final playoff spot — mixing in embarrassing blowout defeats with last-second dejections.This time, they held a lead in the final minute that could not be preserved. After Derrick Rose hit a layup to give the Knicks a 107-105 lead with 43.1 seconds left, Dennis Schroder responded with a 3-pointer 21 seconds later. Hornacek was unhappy with his team’s defense on the play, criticizing Rose afterward for not closing out on Schroder with enough zeal.Still, the Knicks came close to stealing a win in the final seconds. Rose, who had 18 points and 9 assists, had an open lane after the Hawks’ defense broke down defending the pick-and-roll, but Paul Millsap came from the weak side to block Rose’s shot with 5.9 seconds left. Anthony grabbed the loose ball out of midair but missed a short jump shot inside the lane, and then Noah hit the front rim with a putback.“That’s a shot that I think I can hit in my sleep,” Anthony said.His lamentations only further underlined the Knicks’ woes at this point. It is a team attempting to merely stabilize itself before it gets too late.Monday, Hornacek chose to rejigger the starting lineup. With Kristaps Porzingis out for a third straight game because of a sore Achilles’ tendon, Hornacek put Ron Baker and Mindaugas Kuzminskas on the court and moved Courtney Lee to the bench. Baker and Kuzminskas are two fan favorites who have received inconsistent playing time, while Lee signed a four-year, $50 million contract in the off-season.Baker hit four 3-pointers, and Kuzminskas scored 14 points in 38 minutes, though Baker came out of the game with a bloodied tongue, and Kuzminskas sustained a bruised right eye.Although Hornacek made the change in part to strengthen the second unit and in part to make Lee a bigger offensive threat, Lee scored just 7 points and sat for most of the second half. The lineup change did not seem to engender unanimity, either.“When you come in here, you don’t really know what’s going to happen,” Brandon Jennings said. “So there’s kind of no consistency. It’s really tough right now.”It may hint, however, at a larger philosophical shift by the coach. Hornacek mused that if Porzingis were healthy, he might have started at center and Anthony at power forward. Anthony did end up playing at power forward for large swaths of the game on Monday and finished with 30 points, shooting 10 of 16.“In the long run, we’ve got to look at, hey, when K.P. comes back, do we change everything altogether?” Hornacek asked, referring to Porzingis. “What it will do? Sometimes it’s a chance you have to take. But we need to look at where we’re at. We just need to mix it up a little bit more.”Much of the intrigue with Anthony, though, comes off the court. The organization is embroiled in still another distracting story line, with Charley Rosen, a friend and confidant to the team president, Phil Jackson, criticizing Anthony in an article and suggesting he is nearly washed up; and Anthony responding by wondering aloud whether it was time for him to leave the Knicks.Anthony said Monday that he had not spoken with Jackson or General Manager Steve Mills since the article was published. It has created a palpable unease around Anthony and the Knicks. He maintains a no-trade clause in his contract, and Anthony reiterated that he wants to stay with the team.Nor is he looking for clarity from Jackson.“If they want to come talk to me, I’m around them guys every day,” Anthony said. “I don’t want this to be kind of going-back-and-forth matchup between me and the front office and management, because it’s really nothing. I responded to an article that I read, and that was that. There’s nothing between myself and management at this point.”"
"President Obama, a White Sox Fan, Welcomes the Cubs to the White House","WASHINGTON — The team that wins the World Series typically visits the White House during the subsequent baseball season. But President Obama wanted none of that tradition. With his presidency down to its final week, and the start of the 2017 season still more than two months away, Mr. Obama arranged for the Chicago Cubs to celebrate on Monday.And why not? Mr. Obama is a Chicagoan, even if he is a fan of the city’s other baseball team, the White Sox. The Cubs, in winning the 2016 Series and ending a confounding 108-year championship drought, also produced one of the more improbable sports accomplishments in Mr. Obama’s eight years in office.So it was baseball in January and Mr. Obama was enjoying the moment, the final White House event of his presidency.“I’ve only got four days left,” Mr. Obama said as the afternoon ceremony began. “I made a lot of promises in 2008. We’ve managed to fulfill a large number of them. But even I was not crazy enough to suggest that during these eight years we would see the Cubs win the World Series.”It almost did not happen. The Cubs blew a lead in Game 7 of the Series, seemed ordained to fail yet again, then rallied in extra innings to beat the Cleveland Indians, a team that has not won a championship in nearly 70 years.This past weekend, the Cubs were the hosts of an exultant fan convention in downtown Chicago before flying East to meet the president, with a visit to the Walter Reed military hospital scheduled for later on Monday.That would add a somber note to the Cubs’ day, and there was a reflective moment, too, when Mr. Obama, noting the visit was taking place on Martin Luther King’s Birthday, described the influence sports can have on politics and American life. He said a line could be traced from Jackie Robinson, who broke baseball’s color barrier, to his own election as president.Still, the overall mood of Monday’s get-together was playful, even raucous.Before the event, Cubs players, some dressed in three-piece suits, wandered around giddily, taking group photos. The team’s standout first baseman, Anthony Rizzo, said he felt “like a kid in a candy shop.” When the event did start, with guests and reporters packed into the room, cheering and singing periodically broke out. Cubs caps dotted the crowd.There was an element of poignancy, too, with former Cubs stars who never did win it all — players like Billy Williams, Ferguson Jenkins and Ryne Sandberg — on hand. Another former Cub, Jose Cardenal, who was Michelle Obama’s Wrigley Field favorite from her Chicago childhood, also received an invite and got an ovation when he was introduced.It was left to Theo Epstein, the team’s president for baseball operations, to speak on behalf of the Cubs. He thanked Mr. Obama for the “dignity and integrity” he demonstrated as president. He wryly offered a “midnight pardon” for Mr. Obama for his support for the White Sox, then gave Mr. Obama a lifetime ticket good for any game at Wrigley Field.The Cubs’ blithe and idiosyncratic manager, Joe Maddon, came dressed for the occasion in a black turtleneck, olive jacket, blue pants and boots, flouting the dress code. He took questions from reporters outside the White House after the event, saying he “had a lot of respect for the office” while deferring on a question about President-elect Donald J. Trump.Toward the end of the East Room event, more conventional gifts were handed to Mr. Obama, the country’s 44th president, including a white team jersey with the number 44 on the back. A placard with the number 44 was also taken from Wrigley Field’s famous manual scoreboard and framed for Mr. Obama.The championship trophy was also on hand. When Mr. Epstein took over in Chicago in October 2011, that trophy amounted to a responsibility. Mr. Epstein had already won it twice as general manager of the Boston Red Sox, breaking that team’s historic curse. Now he was expected to do the same for the Cubs.It took a while. But after several dreary seasons while Mr. Epstein rebuilt the franchise, the Cubs almost made it to the World Series in 2015. Then in 2016, they finished the job.On Monday, a number of current and former White House staff members were seated up in the front during the ceremony, including one unnamed staff member Mr. Obama playfully chided for being interviewed at a bar outside Wrigley Field during the World Series when he was supposed to be at work.Mr. Obama turned out to be a more gracious host than President Theodore Roosevelt, who was in office the last time the Cubs won the World Series, in 1908.Mr. Roosevelt despised baseball and refused to watch it. Before he left office, he finally relented and agreed to have three American League clubs — the Washington Senators, the New York Highlanders and the Cleveland Naps — pay a visit.More than a century later, Mr. Obama needed no coaxing. And now that he will have more time on his hands, he can watch as much Cubs baseball as he wants. And the White Sox, too."
Pittsburgh Penguins End Washington Capitals’ Win Streak in 8-7 Thriller,"The Pittsburgh Penguins ended the Washington Capitals’ nine-game winning streak with a wild 8-7 overtime victory that included nine second-period goals.Conor Sheary scored two goals, including the winner 34 seconds into overtime, for the Penguins, who ended a three-game losing streak. Evgeni Malkin picked up his 11th career hat trick during a frenetic second period, and Sidney Crosby collected his N.H.L.-leading 27th goal and three assists. Bryan Rust and Nick Bonino also scored for Pittsburgh, and Matt Murray got the win despite allowing seven goals on 28 shots.“That second period is one of the craziest periods I’ve ever been associated with,” Penguins Coach Mike Sullivan said. “I don’t even know how to assess it.”The Penguins trailed, 3-0, before scoring six times in less than 11 minutes in the second period. The Capitals had not allowed six goals in a game all season.Lars Eller scored twice for Washington, and T. J. Oshie, Brett Connolly, Nicklas Backstrom, Justin Williams and Andre Burakovsky also found the net.ISLANDERS SHUT OUT BRUINS Islanders goaltender Thomas Greiss stopped 32 shots for his first shutout of the season — and the first by an Islanders goalie in Boston — to lead the visiting Islanders past the Bruins, 4-0.Antonio Brown wanted to let the world in on the party when he live streamed the giddy celebration in the Steelers’ locker room after an 18-16 playoff win over Kansas City on Sunday.Brown, an All-Pro wide receiver, also caught Coach Mike Tomlin using an expletive to describe the New England Patriots, Pittsburgh’s opponent in the A.F.C. championship game.Tomlin’s word choice did not bother his players as much as Brown’s decision to throw back the curtain on what is usually a private moment.“Personally I’d like some of that stuff sacred,” long snapper Greg Warren said. “But this is a changing world, a changing environment. I can’t be some old guy stuck under a rock, that’s for sure.”Patriots Coach Bill Belichick hardly seemed bothered by Tomlin’s comments.“I’m not on SnapFace and all that so I don’t really get those,” Belichick said during a radio interview. “I’m really just worried about getting our team ready to go. I’m not really too worried about what they put on InstantChat or whatever it is.”CHIEFS COACH DISAGREES WITH PENALTY Chiefs Coach Andy Reid said he did not believe that the holding penalty on left tackle Eric Fisher that cost Kansas City a tying 2-point conversion against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday night should have been called.After rewatching the important play from the Steelers’ 18-16 victory in an A.F.C. divisional-round game, Reid said that “I don’t want to be fined any money, but I’d lean a different way.”JETS EXTEND GUARD’S CONTRACT. The Jets signed right guard Brian Winters to a four-year contract extension. Winters, 25, started 13 games last season before being placed on injured reserve with a shoulder injury.Karolina Pliskova and Johanna Konta won their first-round matches in straight sets Tuesday at the Australian Open in Melbourne.The fifth-seeded Pliskova followed her title win at the Brisbane International with a 6-2, 6-0 victory over Sara Sorribes Tormo at Rod Laver Arena. Pliskova, who lost the United States Open final to Angelique Kerber last year, has never advanced past the third round at Melbourne Park.The ninth-seeded Konta, who won the Sydney International title last week, defeated Kirsten Flipkens, 7-5, 6-2, at Margaret Court Arena.In the men’s bracket, third-seeded Milos Raonic defeated Dustin Brown, 6-3, 6-4, 6Kris Jenkins scored 16 points and Jalen Brunson added 13 to lead No. 1 Villanova to a 76-46 win at home over Seton Hall.The Wildcats (18-1, 6-1 Big East) looked every bit like a team that could win a second straight national championship in their first game after returning to No. 1 in The Associated Press poll.Villanova had fallen from the top spot to third in the poll after a Jan. 4 loss at Butler. But wins over Marquette and Xavier vaulted the Wildcats over the Kansas Jayhawks and back into the top spot.Led by four 3-pointers from Jenkins, the Wildcats set a program record with their 47th straight win at the Pavilion.AROUND THE N.C.A.A. Roy Williams became the ninth Division I men’s coach with 800 career victories as No. 9 North Carolina defeated visiting Syracuse, 85-68.  Frank Mason III had 16 points as No. 2 Kansas held off host Iowa State, 76-72, for its 17th straight win.  Cole Huff got a pivotal rebound and made a pair of free throws with 16.7 seconds left, and No. 7 Creighton rallied for a 72-67 win over No. 22 Xavier."
"Ted Ligety, Olympic Gold Medal Skier, to Have Season-Ending Back Surgery","Ted Ligety, a two-time Olympic skiing gold medalist and a five-time world champion, announced Monday that he planned to have a back operation that would end his World Cup racing this winter and could cloud his prospects for the Winter Olympics next year in Pyeongchang, South Korea.Ligety, the defending Olympic and world champion in the giant slalom, wrote on his Instagram account that he had been suffering from severe nerve pain in his left leg since October and that it had inhibited his performance.“I have seen many doctors and therapists, undergone an array of treatments and therapies to no effect,” Ligety wrote.He added: “This has been tough to accept especially after last season, but on the plus side hopefully this surgery will alleviate the back issues I have dealt with over the last few years. I will be back strong and fast again.”Ligety, 32, who said he was having a microdiscectomy, a procedure typically performed on herniated disks, was already coming back from another serious injury, a tear in his anterior cruciate ligament that he sustained in training last January.Ligety, an American who dominated the giant slalom competition in recent years, has been dealing with disk problems in his back. And his results have declined recently: After finishing fifth in the season-opening giant slalom, he finished 29th and 11th, then did not finish his last two races."
Ivan Rodriguez Dogged by Suspicions at Cooperstown’s Door,"Some of the claims in “Juiced,” the explosive book by Jose Canseco, can be easily refuted. He says on Page 65 that he hit a home run at Tiger Stadium in 1986, which he did not. He says on Page 232 that he pinch-hit in Game 6 of the 2000 World Series, which actually ended in five games.Yet while Canseco might not have been great with game details, the broad strokes of his groundbreaking exposé of the steroid era have made an indelible mark. He named Mark McGwire as a steroid user, and McGwire later admitted it. He also named Rafael Palmeiro, who failed a drug test and served a suspension in 2005, just months after the book came out. Both players hit more than 500 homers but fell far short of induction to the Hall of Fame.Another player Canseco implicated, Ivan Rodriguez, now stands on the doorstep of Cooperstown. Rodriguez, a 14-time All-Star with 13 Gold Gloves, has been named on 78.1 percent of the 215 writers’ ballots made public through Monday. Ryan Thibodaux, who aggregates the votes on his Twitter account, estimates this to be about half of the total ballots to be announced on Wednesday, when the Hall unveils its new members.With 75 percent needed for election, the class seems certain to include Tim Raines (91.2 percent) and Jeff Bagwell (88.8). Rodriguez is polling third, ahead of Vladimir Guerrero (74.0) and Trevor Hoffman (72.6), though percentages typically fall when the full results are revealed. Guerrero, like Rodriguez, is on the ballot for the first time, while Hoffman returns after a strong debut, at 67.2 percent.“Last year I had no idea what kind of support I might garner,” Hoffman, who had 601 career saves, said in an interview at the World Series. “To have, in my opinion, a great number to come out with — 67 — was incredible. I think this year will be more of a testament of how the true, across-the-board writers feel. Hopefully there’s a continued slow uptick that has happened in the past.”Hoffman was right; starting with so many votes generally gives a candidate so much momentum that he will eventually vault the 75 percent line. Likewise, Rodriguez’s early support makes him a virtual lock for induction, and probably soon. Mike Piazza, the National League’s premier catcher while Rodriguez starred in the American League for the Texas Rangers, needed four tries and faced a similar roadblock.In Piazza’s case, some writers withheld votes because they suspected he used performance-enhancing drugs, despite no hard evidence. There is none on Rodriguez, either, unless you consider Canseco’s claims of personally injecting him with steroids.Scott Miller of Bleacher Report said he did not consider Canseco’s book to be gospel, but he also did not vote for Rodriguez among his eight choices. Miller did not vote for Barry Bonds or Roger Clemens, either, because of their ties to performance-enhancing drugs. But he is not prepared to say that he will always reject Rodriguez.“I’ve got Pudge in a holding pattern,” Miller said. “I wish I knew more about what he did or didn’t do. I’m abstaining on voting for him now based on a combination of the Canseco book and what we saw of him physically toward the end of his career. When he came into Tigers camp, he almost looked like he was 18 again.”That was in February 2005, the year after baseball began testing for steroids with penalties for use and just days after Canseco’s revelations surfaced. Rodriguez denied the allegations to The Detroit Free Press — “I’ve been in baseball 14 years not using that; I don’t need it,” he said — and added that he had lost 22 pounds because he had felt too heavy while playing defense the year before.Rodriguez came to the Tigers after leading the Marlins to the World Series title in 2003. Todd Hollandsworth, an outfielder on that team and now a Marlins broadcaster, said Rodriguez was clearly regarded then as a future Hall of Famer and endorsed his candidacy now. Hollandsworth said he never saw a teammate using banned drugs, adding that it was impossible to untangle who did what when judging the era before steroid testing.“I put it more on baseball,” said Hollandsworth, who also played with Piazza. “For this generation, if you fail a test, it’s one strike and you’re out. I would never vote for you to get into the Hall of Fame — you cheated, and there’s no telling what else you did.”As for the players who came just before, Hollandsworth said: “What else do we have to stand on? There’s nothing there. It’s all hearsay and it’s all verbal wars.”The Hall of Fame asks voters to consider sportsmanship, integrity and character, and while Miller said he was uncomfortable in the role of moral arbiter, he added that the league and the union waited too long to police the era. Voting against steroid users, he said, was his small way of standing up for fair play.“I just don’t want to rush to check his box,” Miller said of Rodriguez. “If he gets in, that’s fine and that’s the way it goes. Anybody who watched him on the field would conclude that he’s a Hall of Famer. But as we continue to wade through the mess of the steroid era, I just proceed with caution.”While Miller and some others wait, many more have supported Rodriguez. Evan Grant of The Dallas Morning News voted for him, explaining that Rodriguez holds the major league record for games and innings as catcher and has an endorsement from the Hall of Famer Johnny Bench.“He should be a lock,” Bench told Grant. “Thirteen Gold Gloves. As complete a catcher as I’ve ever seen.”Bench is the only catcher elected to the Hall of Fame on the first ballot. Rodriguez might not be the second, but he won’t be far behind — no matter what Canseco wrote."
"In Warriors’ Rout of Cavaliers, a Big Dose of Catharsis","OAKLAND, Calif. — An evening of collective catharsis for many basketball fans here reached its most satisfying apex in the form of a forearm shiver.Midway through the second quarter, Draymond Green, no stranger to contact or controversy, prevented the forward progress of LeBron James by throwing the full weight of his 230-pound frame into the general vicinity of James’s sternum. James tumbled to the court at Oracle Arena on Monday with all the finesse of a sack of potatoes. Green stalked away in disbelief, fully convinced that James had flopped.Green (Golden State Warriors) and James (Cleveland Cavaliers) are high-profile representatives of two of the finest teams in the N.B.A., and it was impossible to miss the symbolism of their collision.“Two strong forces coming together,” the Warriors’ Stephen Curry said.Fans inside the building reacted as if James, already unpopular among the Bay Area populace, refuses to compost his trash. Their boos were almost lusty in their disdain for him. The officials assessed Green with a flagrant foul, but it turned out to be a mere speed bump for the Warriors, who continued to go about their business of pulverizing the Cavaliers.Nobody would be surprised to see these two teams reunite in the N.B.A. finals some four and a half months from now. Monday’s result — a 126-91 victory by the Warriors — will probably mean little in the long run. But there is no question that it provided a psychological lift for the Warriors, a superpower that is not immune to the lingering effects of history.“We all remember that,” Warriors Coach Steve Kerr said. “I didn’t have to say anything.”He was referring, of course, to last season’s N.B.A. finals, when the Warriors blew a three-games-to-one series lead and watched the Cavaliers dance away with their first championship. It was, in a less significant way, more of the same when the Warriors faced the Cavaliers on Christmas, only to let a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter evaporate in a 1-point loss.On Monday, the Warriors (35-6) were not about to let that happen again. They scored 78 points in the first half and led by as many as 39. The Cavaliers (29-11) looked as if they were wearing concrete sneakers and lofting jump shots into a stiff breeze.“They put it on us,” James said of the Warriors. “They put it on us real good.”It should be noted that the Cavaliers had spent nearly two weeks on the road. Their visit to Oakland was the sixth and final stop of a grueling trip. The Warriors, on the other hand, have been relishing an extended stretch in Northern California. They had not played since Thursday. They were well rested and played like it.“Well, we wanted to win,” Kerr said, adding: “Anytime you’re facing a team that you know is one of the best in the league, you’re going to be up for it. We were definitely up for it.”At the same time, Kerr cautioned against reading too much into it. He recalled how the Warriors demolished the Cavaliers in a regular-season game last January.“Everyone counted them out and said we were in their heads,” Kerr said. “And then they won the whole thing.”Still, the result was satisfying for the Warriors. Satisfying to limit the Cavaliers to 35.2 percent shooting. Satisfying to outrebound them by 23. Satisfying to block 11 of their shots. Satisfying to beat them for the first time in seven months.During his news conference, Curry was briefly interrupted by a few stanzas from the song “Good Feeling” by the rapper Flo Rida. Curry bobbed his head.“That’s my mood right now,” he said. “I’m feeling good.”Curry has had his struggles against the Cavaliers. In last season’s finals, he averaged 22.6 points a game while shooting 40.3 percent from the field, which was substandard production for him. On Christmas, he put together another (relative) clunker: 15 points on 4-of-11 shooting.With that in mind, he sounded as if he had found some solace in Monday’s win. He did not shoot well — he went 7 of 20 from the field and scored 20 points — but he collected 10 of his 11 assists by halftime and was aggressive from the start.“You can feel the atmosphere when you get out there,” Curry said. “Anytime you play a team like Cleveland, or other top teams in the league, you know it’s going to take an A-plus game to get a win, and a lot of energy, physicality and focus. We sensed that early in the game and grabbed the momentum and never really let it go. It’s what we’re supposed to do.”Before Monday’s game, James played down the suggestion that the Cavaliers had a full-fledged rivalry with the Warriors. Green, for one, disagreed.“I think it’s a rivalry,” Green said, adding: “Regardless of Bron thinking this is a rivalry, I know he wants to beat us. And we want to beat them. And that’s enough in itself.”The Cavaliers and the Warriors will not face each other again in the regular season. Given the intensity of these games, Green said that two meetings were enough.“I think the fact that you only play two times a year makes it more exciting, because you only get two cracks at it,” Green said. “If you want to play each other again, then try to get to the N.B.A. finals.”For two teams that do not like each other, that, at least, is a goal they can share."
