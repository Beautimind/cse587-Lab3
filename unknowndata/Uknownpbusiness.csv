India Tells Mobile Firms to Delay Deals for Chinese Telecom Equipment,"NEW DELHI — Worried about reports of Chinese hackers and spying, the Indian government has effectively barred local mobile phone operators from making deals with Chinese telecommunications manufacturers, according to the head of India’s main cellular industry trade group.India is running a trade deficit with China and the issue could further strain relations between the two countries.In December, the Telecommunications Department quietly asked Indian mobile phone operators to suspend deals with foreign equipment companies, citing security concerns, Rajan S. Mathews, director general of the Cellular Operators Association of India, a trade group, said in an interview on Friday.This week the government told several mobile phone operators that proposed deals with Chinese companies could not go ahead right now, industry executives said.The government had told operators in December that it was worried that a foreign company could install spying software, and asked local operators to examine foreign manufacturers carefully, Mr. Mathews said. But in recent months, the Indian government has lifted the restriction on most foreign manufacturers; those that are not cleared are “principally Chinese,” he said.The Ministry of Home Affairs, which deals with domestic security in India, said on Friday that it could not comment on the issue.A spokesman for the Telecommunications Department, S. Prakash, acknowledged on Friday that the government had recently stepped up scrutiny of foreign equipment suppliers. But he said “the government has not banned any particular equipment or manufacturer” and decided “on a case-by-case basis” whether to allow deals to happen.“This happens everywhere,” Mr. Prakash said, because “telecommunications devices are likely to get misused.”A spokeswoman for a Chinese equipment industry trade group said Friday that her group had heard reports “that India would ban importing telecom equipment from China for one or two months.”The Indian government’s behavior would violate World Trade Organization “principles of ‘national treatment’ if they only ban importing equipment from China but continue importing from the United States and Europe,” said Zhang Huiling, a spokeswoman for the China Chamber of Commerce of Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Projects.“We will closely follow the latest development,” she added.Foreign telecommunications equipment makers have been an integral part of India’s fast-growing mobile phone industry, because India does not have any significant manufacturers of its own.Mr. Mathews said the government had decided to “lock down all the barnyard doors,” because of concerns about Chinese hackers.According to a report released last month by the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, a gang of computer hackers based in China conducted an extensive spying operation in India that began last year, obtaining sensitive information, including documents from the Ministry of Defense.Relations between India and China, the world’s most populous nations, have been strained recently over border issues and India’s trade imbalance with China. And India recently clamped down on the number of work visas allotted to foreign companies, a move regarded by some as being aimed at Chinese power companies that import laborers from home to build plants here.India’s mobile phone industry is second only to China’s in terms of subscribers, with 584 million at the end of March. More than 20 million new subscribers were added in March, and local phone operators are under pressure to add network capacity quickly.Indian mobile operators invested about $34 billion in networks and other capital expenses in the last fiscal year, the Indian telecommunications trade agency estimated. About 40 percent of that equipment came from China, where products cost about 20 percent less than those made by European providers like Nokia and Siemens.According to an executive with one of India’s largest mobile operators, the government told the company this week that it could not go through with the purchase of equipment from UTStarcom, a company that is headquartered in California but which has most of its employees and managers in China.The government said some deals the company was planning were “good to go, and these were not,” said the executive, who declined to be identified because the government had not made its policy official.Mr. Prakash, of the Telecommunications Department, said he could not speak specifically about UTStarcom, but acknowledged “that might have happened.”Chinese companies, including Huawei Technologies and the ZTE Corporation, have “actively participated” in the construction of India’s telecommunications network since 1999, the Chinese import-export group said in a statement on Friday. The two companies employ nearly 7,000 people in India, and 85 percent of those employees are Indian, the statement said.Indian mobile operators considering deals with foreign telecommunications manufacturers have been required since December to submit the details to the Telecommunications Department, which forwards the information to the Ministry of Home Affairs for security clearance, according to the cellular operators association.In a memo  posted on its Web site on March 18, the Telecommunications Department clarified its security clearance rules, stating that the “operation and maintenance of telecom networks should be entirely by Indian engineers” and adding that the “dependence on foreign engineers should be minimal” within two years from a purchase.Indian telecommunications companies are also required to demand that foreign manufacturers transfer their technology to make “critical” equipment and software within three years of a sale, the memo said, concluding that any Indian company that did not enforce technology transfers would be subject to criminal prosecution."
Barclays Profit Is Up 29% in First Quarter,"LONDON  —  Barclays reported on Friday that its profit rose 29 percent in the first quarter, helped by its investment banking business and fewer  bad loans.But some investors were disappointed at the pace of growth at the securities unit, the biggest contributor to Barclays’ earnings, and  shares  dropped 4.4 percent in London on  Friday morning.“Concerns regarding a slowing in the pace of improvement for the group’s investment banking operations have hit the shares,” Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said.  The earnings announcement on Friday “appears to be reminding investors that the road ahead will be bumpy.”Profit rose to £1.07 billion, or $1.65 billion, from £826 million in the first three months of last year. Barclays Capital, the securities unit, reported that pretax profit rose 62 percent to £1.47 billion, making it the most profitable business for Barclays.But the investment banking earnings followed strong results from rivals like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase  last  month.   Barclays Capital, run by Barclays’ president, Robert E. Diamond, received “lower contributions from rates and commodities,” which was offset by its credit businesses and emerging markets, the bank said.Impairment charges and money the bank set aside for loan defaults declined to £1.51 billion from £2.31 billion in the same period last year and from £1.86 billion in the last the months of 2009.“The improvement that we have seen in impairment reflects the signs of economic recovery now evident in many of the markets in which we operate,” John Varley, the chief executive, said in a statement.Barclays invested in expanding its investment bank in Europe and Asia by hiring staff members after buying Lehman Brothers’ operations in the United States.Chris Lucas, the chief financial officer, said on Friday that the bank set aside the same ratio of revenue for bonus payments as  last year, but added that the exact level remuneration would only be decided toward the end of this year.The bank also said that its exposure to the Greek economic crisis was “small” and it did not expect the country’s economic turmoil to pose “a government bond risk” for the bank.Barclays increased its risk-weighted assets by 8 percent to £415 billion."
Wall Street Finishes April With a Thud,"Wall Street ended the month on a down note Friday as shares struggled from the open.Fueling Friday’s decline were the uncertainties surrounding the Greek debt crisis and downgrades of the investment bank Goldman Sachs. The bank’s stock dropped 9.4 percent, to $145.20, a day after reports that the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan had started a criminal investigation into the bank’s trading. That sent other bank shares lower.“The matters now facing Goldman perhaps would make investors approach banks with greater caution than otherwise,” John Lanski, Moody’s Capital Markets’ chief economist, said. But, he added, it is hard to “argue convincingly of a possible contagion effect” of any new charges.“But I think the problem with banks’ stocks of late is more related to where financial reform is leading as opposed to the difficulties or the matter pertaining to Goldman Sachs,” Mr. Lanski said.The Dow Jones industrial average  settled at 11,008.61, down 158.71, or 1.4 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was at 1,186.68, down 20.10, or 1.7 percent, and the Nasdaq  was at 2,461.19, down 50.73, or 2 percent.For the week, the Dow declined 1.7 percent, the S.& P. fell 2.5 percent and the Nasdaq dropped 2.7 percent. Still, indexes finished the month higher. The Dow and the S.& P. both rose about 1.4 percent for the month.The major European markets also fell. The FTSE 100 in London dropped 1.2 percent, the DAX index in Frankfurt declined 0.2 percent, and the  CAC-40 in Paris fell 0.6 percent.“We have gone through episodes recently where the market thought that a resolution was close at hand,”  Mr. Lanski said, referring to the Greek debt crisis. “There are definitely lingering concerns about another intensification of the Greek government debt crisis.”Greek officials said the government had agreed to austerity measures totaling 24 billion euros (about $32 billion) that would include cutting some workers’ pay and some public sector jobs as well as opening up parts of the economy. Details could be announced on Sunday.While the stream of earnings and economic indicators this week have suggested some improvement in the economy, the latest indicator fell just shy of expectations. The government said the overall economy grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter, but the expansion has still not brought jobs growth to levels compensating for recession losses.“The equity market received no support from an as-expected first-quarter reading of G.D.P.,” Mr. Lanski said. But, “I would not blame the sell-off on a somewhat disappointing G.D.P. report.”“I think it is more because of worries over the European sovereign debt, he said, “as well as the unknown final fate of financial reform legislation,” which the Senate began debating on Thursday.“That type of uncertainty is going to weigh more heavily on banks, and that seems to be the case today,” Mr. Lanski said.Terry Morris, the senior vice president and senior equity manager for National Penn Investors Trust, said that the market had probably already factored in the G.D.P. report.“I think it was already built in, so that it was somewhat of a nonevent,” he said. “It is going to take more to make this market keep going higher.”Among other bank stocks, Morgan Stanley dropped 3.5 percent,   JPMorgan Chase fell 3.2 percent and Citigroup 4.1  percent.The insurer Genworth Financial closed down 8.7 percent at $16.52, after posting a quarterly profit that fell short of estimates.Industrial and heavily traded information technology stocks were also lower. The chip maker Intel ended down 2.8 percent at $22.84. The utilities sector posted the most gains. The FPL Group  was up 2.7 percent at $52.05, and NRG Energy was up 1.6 percent at $24.17.Bond prices rose on the day. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, fell to 3.65  percent, from 3.73 percent late Thursday."
Consumers Help Drive U.S. Economy to 3.2% Growth Rate,"The United States economy has expanded for three quarters in a row, the Commerce Department said on Friday, helped along by consumer spending. Now the question is, Will the jobs follow?The broadest measure of the overall economy grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2010, the Commerce Department reported. It had expanded 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 2.2 percent in the third quarter.While the expansion is welcome, it has not delivered the level of hiring needed to recover the ground lost during the recession.Speaking in the Rose Garden on Friday, President Obama acknowledged that many Americans might find little comfort in the numbers because “ ‘you’re hired’ is the only economic news they’re waiting to hear.”Still, economists are hopeful that news of solid, continued growth may bolster business confidence and persuade more companies to expand.“It’s been a case of, when will they stop worrying and learn to love the boom?” said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG, who added that many analysts and companies had underestimated the economic turnaround.After dragging their heels for many months, consumers were at last a major contributor to economic growth in the first quarter. Consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, a big gain from the 1.6 percent rate of the previous three months. Purchases of durable goods like cars led the way.Whether Americans might retrench for the long haul after seeing their homes lose value has been one of the biggest questions about the aftermath of the Great Recession. Consumer spending makes up more than 70 percent of the economy, and it usually drives growth during economic recoveries.Economists are hopeful that families will continue to pick up the pace of purchasing and make the recovery more sustainable, although consumers may remain cautious about spending given the tepid growth in job creation and personal income. Consumer sentiment dipped slightly in April, according to a Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index released on Friday.“We haven’t had consumer spending growth this strong in three years,” said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight. “But the caveat is that with real disposable incomes not growing, this was all done through the saving rate. We cannot rely on consumers continually driving down their savings. They need income support from hiring.”Small businesses say Americans are loosening up a little after a bewildering period of debt reduction and uncertainty.Nate Evans, who owns a pottery-making business with his wife, Hallie, in New Albin, Iowa, said sales in 2009 were the worst ever but that business was just starting to pick up. The Evanses sell their wares from their Allamakee Wood-Fired Pottery home studio as well as in galleries in nearby states, and at craft shows in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois.“I felt like the energy of the crowd was better,” Mr. Evans said of the first fair this year, in Minnesota, adding that other craft sellers seemed to agree. “Most of the people we talked to said it was better than last year. Hey, it’s not great, but it’s better than last year.”Just as Americans stepped up their purchases of autos and other products in the first quarter, companies invested more in capital goods. Business purchases of equipment and software, for example, grew at an annual rate of 13.4 percent, building on a 19 percent increase in the final quarter of 2009.For the first time in two years, businesses started increasing their stockpiles of goods. This inventory growth accounted for about half of the expansion in the first quarter. In the previous quarter, about two-thirds of economic growth resulted from a decision by companies to draw down their inventories more slowly — that is, not clearing their stockroom shelves so quickly but still not adding to them.Additional spending by companies “is very good news, since it indicates businesses are feeling more confident about the expansion to start spending some of their cash,” Mr. Gault said. “If businesses are spending more on equipment, usually that would go along with more hiring, too.”Federal government spending, including some remaining money from stimulus programs, grew at an annualized rate of 1.4 percent in the first quarter. But this was more than offset by continued cuts by state and local governments, whose spending decreased 3.8 percent. It was the third consecutive quarterly decline for state and local spending.“Government spending contracted, for all the ballyhoo about stimulus,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. “This recovery is going to have to stand on the backs of private-sector demand, not on government demand, given all the current fiscal challenges.”Modest expansion in business activity may not be enough to ease the lasting pain of the recession, many economists say.Hiring only recently began to materialize, with the economy adding 162,000 jobs in March, of which 48,000 were temporary Census-related positions. The economy had shed about eight million jobs since the recession began in December 2007.Job growth hasn’t been as strong as economic growth for several reasons, economists say. Businesses have found ways to make more with fewer resources, meaning that they have been able to meet additional demand for their products without bringing on many new workers. And companies are sitting on a tremendous amount of cash and appear unwilling to spend it.“Companies may be reluctant to invest because there’s an enormous amount of uncertainty ahead for them, not just in health care policy but tax policy,” said Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist at Capital Economics. “This isn’t just about the sustainability of the recovery itself.”Mr. Obama, in his remarks on Friday morning, rejected criticisms that his policies were bad for hiring by talking about tax cuts for small businesses, loans backed by the government and investments in areas like clean energy — policies intended in part to encourage job creation.Even if hiring does finally start to grow at the same rate with demand, the economy is simply not growing fast enough to make a big dent in unemployment, economists say.The nation’s gross domestic product — a broad measure of goods and services produced in the country — is far below its potential, according to projections of where the economy would have been had it followed its long-term trend.Output would need to grow at least 5 percent annually for several years to get back on track — and perhaps what is more important, to stimulate enough job creation to employ the 15 million Americans already out of work and the 100,000 new workers joining the labor force each month.Right now, many economists expect the nation’s output to expand 2.5 to 3.5 percent this year.“Unless the pace of growth picks up significantly, we will see high unemployment rates for years to come,” said Josh Bivens, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization in Washington."
The Bitter Pills in the Plan to Rescue Greece,"ATHENS — Racing to secure financial aid and avoid a debt default, the Greek government has agreed to austerity measures totaling 24 billion euros (about $32 billion) that will include cutting some workers’ pay and some public sector jobs as well as opening up parts of the economy, Greek officials said Friday.A letter of intent with the International Monetary Fund was mostly complete, according to one government official, who declined to be identified because of the confidential nature of the discussions. A deal could be announced by Sunday, this official said.As unions denounced the cost-cutting measures and pledged to take to the streets over the weekend and go on  strike on Wednesday, Prime Minister George Papandreou said Greece must quickly adopt the international aid plan. “Today, the top priority is the survival of the nation,” he told Parliament on Friday. “This is the red line.”The euro gained against the dollar for a third day, rising to $1.3312, as fears that Greece’s turmoil could spread in Europe were surpassed by relief that a bailout was imminent.The details of the plan have been settled in negotiations here with officials of the European Union, the I.M.F. and the European Central Bank. Greek officials close to the discussions said the deal would include as much as 130 billion euros in aid over the next three years at reasonable interest rates. In return,  the I.M.F. asked Greece to cut public sector spending by 8 billion euros in the 14 months after the plan was adopted. Economists called that provision crucial because past reform programs by the government have relied too much on overly optimistic assumptions about the collection of unpaid taxes.Union and government officials said Greece had also pledged to raise its value-added tax to 25 percent, to freeze civil servants’ wages and to eliminate public sector bonuses amounting to two months’ pay. They said the government intended to increase taxes on fuel, tobacco and alcohol.Among the most significant features of the plan, a Greek government official said, would be a measure making it easier for the government to lay off some of the many thousands of public sector workers, whose low levels of productivity and high wages are a big contributor to Greece’s debt problem. Until now, the government has not been able to lay off civil servants, whose employment rights are in effect constitutionally guaranteed.Another reform high on the list is removing the state from the marketplace in crucial sectors like health care, transportation and energy and allowing private investment. Economists say that the liberalization of trucking routes — where a trucking license can cost up to $90,000 — and the health care industry would help bring down prices in these areas, which are among the highest in Europe.Some analysts fear the austerity measures could push Greece into a deeper and prolonged recession and spur widespread social unrest.But Yiannis Stournaras, a leading economist and former economic adviser to the ruling socialist party, said a majority of Greeks had lost the will to rebel. After years of profligate spending, he argued, Greece is being forced to make changes that would improve its competitiveness in the longer term.“In any other situation the reaction would be fierce, but while the Greek people are angry, there will not be a widespread revolt because they realize that the alternative is for the country to go bankrupt. We have no other choice.”As Greek television stations reported on the aid plan, European leaders sought to reassure jittery markets, dismissing calls by some economists for Greece to restructure its debt.Amadeu Altafaj, a spokesman for Olli Rehn, the European Union’s monetary affairs commissioner, said European officials were engaged in what he described as “fire brigading” to ensure stability “on the Greek front.” There would be “no restructuring of the debt,” he said. That’s “not even part of the debate in Athens.”He insisted that no discussions were taking place about whether other euro zone countries could have access to similar financial aid if needed. In recent days debt markets have come under pressure in Portugal and Spain.Meanwhile on Friday in Germany, where the government has equivocated for months, the finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, reiterated a pledge to take swift action to help Greece. Chancellor Angela Merkel faces a regional election in the country’s most populous state, North Rhine Westphalia, on May 9. But Mr. Schäuble, apparently alluding to what was at stake for the euro zone, indicated it was important to maintain the stability of the euro.“Germany will take a major part in coming to the assistance of Greece,” he said. “Opposition groups will not block this. Given the mood in the public in Germany, everyone in politics knows that not being helpful is not a good argument to win regional elections.”In Athens, where the prospect of a rescue has been greeted with a mix of relief and wounded pride, central bank data showed that business and household deposits at Greek banks fell for a third month in March, bringing total losses in the first quarter to 10.6 billion euros. Moody’s Investors Service downgraded its credit ratings on nine Greek banks on Friday.Platon Monokroussos, an economist at EFG Eurobank, the nation’s second-largest bank after the National Bank of Greece, said speculation that austerity measures would include new taxes on savings had caused some wealthy Greeks to move their funds to foreign banks and Cypriot units of Greek banks. But he said he expected the rescue package to calm fears and prevent a flight of funds.Earlier in the week, the finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, told Mega TV that the Greek government had pledged to guarantee deposits at banks. But some businesspeople said the credit squeeze was growing worse.Konstantinos Michalos, president of the Athens Chamber of Commerce and the owner of a company exporting latex products, said businesses were being deprived of much-needed liquidity.He said his group’s members were complaining that some foreign banks were refusing to accept credit guarantees from Greek banks, citing the economic instability. As more Greeks in rural areas took their deposits out of banks and put their savings under their mattresses, he said, home burglaries were on the rise. Despite all the financial concerns, many Greeks insisted that fears of economic collapse were exaggerated.Yiannis Batsos, 37, a lawyer, said he would not shift his money elsewhere in Europe. “If people take their money out of banks, this will only make things worse,” he said on a bustling street in central Athens, where dozens of Greeks sipped cappuccinos, seemingly unperturbed by the economic crisis. “We Greeks are not the only ones in Europe who are in this mess.”"
Goldman’s Shares Plunge on Inquiries and Downgrades,"How much trouble is Goldman Sachs really in?One answer: About $21 billion worth.That’s how much the vaunted Wall Street bank has lost in market value since it was engulfed in a fraud accusation two weeks ago.Shares of Goldman tumbled anew on Friday after reports surfaced that federal prosecutors had opened a criminal investigation of the firm, prompting two analysts to downgrade their ratings of the stock. The share price fell a precipitous 9.4 percent in an avalanche of selling, to close at $145.20, a nine-month low.That drop helped sink the broader market. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 1.4 percent, ending lower for the week for the first time in about two months.Goldman employees took a direct hit — as a group they are the second-biggest owner of the company, with 4 percent of its outstanding shares. Axa, the French insurer, owns slightly more.The criminal investigation is in an early stage and may not lead to charges. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which brought the civil suit, is sharing information with prosecutors, according to a law enforcement official, but the focus of the criminal inquiry is unknown.The criminal inquiry has been under way since early this year, the official said, before the S.E.C. filed its action on April 16 but months after Goldman learned of the civil investigation.Wall Street analysts are beginning to acknowledge the potential liabilities Goldman is facing from the fraud accusations leveled by the Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors.On Friday, two analysts, including Guy Moszkowski of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, cut their ratings of Goldman’s shares from buy to neutral, usually seen as equivalent to a hold, chiefly because of the financial risks associated with Goldman’s uncertain legal and political outlook.Citing the federal investigation, Mr. Moszkowski wrote: “Most such probes end inconclusively, with no charges filed; and we continue to believe that GS has long-term earnings power beyond what is discounted in the share price. However, it is very difficult to see the shares making further progress until the matter has been resolved.”Worries about Goldman’s future may receive a further airing this weekend when the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett holds an annual meeting for his company, Berkshire Hathaway, in Omaha, where he is expected to take questions from shareholders. Berkshire is one of the biggest holders of Goldman shares.Analysts and investors are beginning to worry about the potential damage to Goldman’s gilt-edged reputation, which could hurt its franchise if clients turn elsewhere. There is also the potentially hefty cost of fighting or settling the S.E.C.’s civil fraud suit.Then there is the unpalatable prospect of criminal charges tied to Goldman’s trading, against the bank or any of its executives. Goldman denies the S.E.C.’s claim that it deceived investors in a mortgage-related deal, and on Friday it was silent about the criminal inquiry started by the Justice Department.Compared with the commission’s civil action, prosecutors would face a steeper hurdle in trying to bring a criminal case against Goldman. Prosecutors have to meet a higher burden of proof and must prove willfulness on the part of Goldman employees to obtain a criminal conviction.For that reason, several criminal law experts predicted that prosecutors were likely to sit back and see how the civil case progressed.“There is no reason for them to rush precipitously into this case, and much to be gained by acting deliberately and getting whatever cooperation the S.E.C. can from Goldman Sachs,” said Daniel C. Richman, a Columbia University law professor and former federal prosecutor.That calculus could change, however, if the government decides Goldman is not being cooperative, he said. In that case, he said, prosecutors might seek to pressure Goldman employees into breaking ranks, using the threat of prosecution and grand jury subpoenas.If the criminal investigation were indeed to turn up something, it is unlikely that Goldman would escape unscathed, if Wall Street history is an indicator. That is something that equity analysts are beginning to factor into their assessment of the stock.“The risks are kind of piling up,” said Matthew Albrecht, an analyst at Standard & Poor’s who downgraded Goldman’s shares to a sell on Friday, a ratings hit that is rare for Wall Street banks, particularly for Goldman.As if the civil and criminal inquiries were not enough, he said, Goldman also faces the threat of tighter regulation as Congress debates new legislation. That cloud hangs over the balance sheets of all Wall Street banks, but particularly Goldman, whose earnings come from less diversified businesses than those of competitors like JPMorgan Chase, he said.For some investors, however, Goldman’s depressed share price could be seen as a buying opportunity. After all, few people have become rich betting against Goldman. For the time being, the bank is still wildly profitable — last week it posted a first-quarter profit of $3.46 billion, double the amount it recorded in the same quarter last year.Most analysts still like Goldman. In a Bloomberg survey of 28 analysts on Friday, 19 still rated Goldman a buy. (The survey included Mr. Moszkowski but excluded Mr. Albrecht.)In the long run, the recent decline in Goldman’s share price may prove a blip. It hit a record high of around $236 in November 2007 and fell to a low of around $53 in November 2008 during the dark days of the financial crisis. But since then it has recovered sharply — more than tripling between November 2008 and October 2009, when it reached about $190.But that does not mitigate the pain of the latest decline.Since the recent high in October, the shares have fallen back by about 25 percent — much of that coming in the last two weeks since the S.E.C.’s announcement.Trading volumes have shot up — 73 million Goldman shares were traded on Friday, up from average volumes of 13.5 million a day over the period since October — a sign that traders are nervous about the direction Goldman and the investigations are heading.Goldman’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, held 2,023,364 million shares of the company outright as of Jan. 25, 2010. They were worth roughly $373 million on the day before the S.E.C. filed its complaint; on paper Mr. Blankfein has lost more than $81 million since then."
"As Recession Ebbs, Many Still See Gloom","THROUGH recession after recession over the last four decades, Americans remained more optimistic than pessimistic about their own futures, even when they grew very worried about the overall economy.But that ended during the 2007-9 downturn. More people thought their own financial situation was going to get worse than thought it would improve.The Conference Board has been asking consumers the same questions since 1967 as it compiles its consumer confidence index. Three of the questions deal with forecasts of what will change over the next six months, but they differ in perspective.One asks whether the person expects business conditions to improve, stay the same or worsen. Another asks whether the person thinks employment with grow, stay about the same or shrink.Both of those questions seek an assessment of the overall economy, and at the bottom of recessions there has usually been a lot of gloom.The recent recession was, as seen by those questions, similar to other deep recessions in the mid-1970s and the early 1980s.The third question, which is shown on the accompanying chart, is fundamentally different. It does not ask how the economy will do. It asks how the specific person expects to fare. In six months, does the respondent expect his or her own family’s income to be higher, lower or about the same?Until this downturn, the number of people expecting things to get better for themselves had always exceeded the number expecting lower incomes. But at the low point in this cycle, in February and March of last year when the financial system seemed most vulnerable, fewer than 8 percent of respondents expected their income to get better, while almost a quarter thought their incomes were set to decline.The chart shows the difference between those two groups, ignoring the percentage, always large, that expects things to stay about the same.The pessimism shown by those responses has declined since then, but not gone away. In April, the Conference Board reported this week, about one  person in 10 expected his or her family’s income to improve, while about one in six expected family income to go down.As can be seen from the chart, good times in recent years  have produced less net optimism than  in previous cycles, while bad times have brought more pessimism.On its face, such a result would seem to indicate Americans are losing their optimism, but it may not be as simple as that. In this cycle, unlike earlier ones, many workers were forced to take pay cuts, at least on a temporary basis. So it became reasonable to expect lower income, even for some who did not expect to lose their jobs.Still, the  decline in expectations regarding their own incomes is another indication of how much this recession scared people — and that some of the fright remains."
Weighing the Value of a Home Security System,"PEOPLE may be surprised to learn that when they most need their security system to protect their house, they oftentimes cannot rely on it. Jackie Ostrander discovered that when a storm knocked out power to her home in Greenwich, Conn., for a week in March  — too long for her backup battery to keep going. And it took her security company three weeks to restart her system.“I asked, ‘Are we going to get a credit for this?’ We weren’t,” she said of her company, Protection One. “When they came out, I asked, ‘Are you going to charge me for this call?’ They didn’t, but they did charge me $100 for a battery.”Jonathan Marvin, director of business solutions for Protection One, said, “We could have done better.”There are about 36 million security systems in the United States, half of them in homes. Revenue for the industry was $28.2 billion in 2009, according to the Installation Business Report, an annual survey published by Security Sales & Integration Magazine. So a lot of people apparently think their homes are going to be impervious to burglars.But even when the systems are working properly, the police response times can be  slow.Stan Martin, executive director of the Security Industry Alarm Coalition, acknowledged as much. He said that in big cities like New York, Atlanta and Chicago, police could  take 30 to 45 minutes to respond, while in smaller towns the best that could be hoped for was six to eight minutes. Given that those times are in addition to the two minutes it takes for the alarm to register at the monitoring station and the operator to call you, the thief and your jewelry could be  long gone.Mr. Martin also attributed part of the slow response to the high number of false alarms — an estimated 80 percent of alarm calls —  and partly to the low priority of burglaries.To combat false alarms, many police departments charge  after the first or second one, he said. In Stamford, Conn., for instance, the cost is $75. Yet these fines are often levied when a police car just drives past your house, not  even pulling in the driveway, let alone walking around the property.So if you are one of the millions of Americans paying a monthly monitoring fee of $25 to nearly $100, what are you getting for your money? It turns out you get many things beyond securing your home —    like providing an alert in a fire  and keeping an eye on your children’s comings and goings.WHY HAVE AN ALARM? If no one is going to show up when your house is broken into, why bother paying the monthly fee? One reason is that insurance companies offer discounts for security systems. The percentage varies depending on the sophistication of  the system.The Insurance Information Institute says the average discount is  15 to 20 percent. On our homeowner’s policy, the discount savings amounted to $221.93 a  year. A study released last year by the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University found  that the real value of security systems was that they protected entire neighborhoods. The study, which focused on Newark  from 2001 to 2005, found that residential break-ins decreased as the density of alarms in an area increased.In other words, the more people paying that monthly monitoring fee on your street,  the more likely a burglar is not going to take a chance that a police officer  is right around the corner.DO ALARMS DETER CRIME? When so-called smash-and-grab thieves do strike a home with an alarm system, they are more likely to leave quickly.On its Web site, the Electronic Security Association  says that  the average loss on a home with a system is $3,266, compared to $5,343 for a home without one. Nearly $2,100 is nothing to sniff at  —  unless your years of monthly monitoring fees exceed that.“The point of a security system is to reduce loss,” said Mike Miller, president of the security  association. “It may be that instead of losing your TV, you could have lost a lot more.”Mr. Martin said that most thieves wander neighborhoods looking for an easy entry point, like  an open window.  Your security system would have told you to close that window when you tried to turn it on.Wealthier people, though, need another layer of protection since burglaries to their homes are not as opportunistic. Chances are the person who steals your Picasso when you are away did not happen upon your house by chance.Christopher Falkenberg, president of Insite Security, which provides security for Martha Stewart’s homes, said prominent people needed levels of security beyond what  alarms could provide.“Alarms are not sophisticated,” he said, adding that basic monitoring panels have not changed in decades. “That said, you have to have one or you’re definitely going to be targeted. But your expectation can’t be that installing an alarm will be your end-all and be-all.”Upgrading to the level of personalized protection that a firm like Insite provides is not cheap:  its  monthly rate starts at $7,000.From an insurance point of view, this is where the discounts start to increase. “We recommend a layered approach so you are  going to build out from a security system,” said Rich Standring, risk services manager for the East Coast for Fireman’s Fund. “The one shortcoming of a security system is you have to turn it on.”BEYOND SECURITY While keeping burglars out of your house is the foundation of  any security system, the monitoring service can include fire alarms, heat sensors and other  features.Robin Lampe, a spokeswoman  for Protection One, said the company’s systems offered   additional ways to monitor your home. The system can tell  when someone has entered or left a house and when a person is trying to open a liquor or gun cabinet. It  can also send video clips of who has entered a house or even a specific room  —  a great tool for parents eager to see what their children are up to.But in every instance, the security system is only as good as the operator responding to the alert. Jonathan Crystal, who advises customers on their security needs as an executive vice president for  Frank Crystal & Company, said he was traveling and got a call from his monitoring company telling him that the smoke alarm was going off in his home. He knew his baby sitter  was there and asked the operator if she had spoken to her.“I asked the woman if everyone was O.K.,” Mr. Crystal said, “But she said she hadn’t asked, because the person who answered was not authorized on the account.”Mr. Crystal, who would not let me name the security company in print, said he was completely exasperated and ended up switching to a local company, Scarsdale Security. “They didn’t change my system at all, but they provide remote monitoring and they’re excellent,” he said. “They give me peace of mind. I got no peace of mind from” the national service.While paying a monthly monitoring fee may make little financial sense, finding a service that provides you peace of mind is invaluable."
How Much to Donate? God Knows,"When the Obamas released their 2009 income tax returns a few weeks ago, we itemized their charitable contributions on our Bucks personal finance blog. Some readers praised their choices and some  criticized them, which was predictable. But a few others got into a far more interesting debate.Some people wondered whether the first couple should have given more money away than the 6 percent of their adjusted gross income that they did dole out, though people did credit the couple for redirecting to charity all of the $1.4 million the president was awarded for winning the Nobel Peace Prize. Others noted that George and Laura Bush gave away a much higher percentage of their income  in 2007: 18 percent.To my mind, though, looking solely at income misses the bigger picture. If we’re going to try to set standards that might offer guidance for us all, shouldn’t we look not just at what people earn but what they have? Once you do, it suggests a whole new way of thinking about what to give and a couple of ways to donate higher amounts more easily.Americans gave away 2.2 percent of their personal disposable income to nonprofit groups of various sorts in 2008, according to Giving USA, an annual report on philanthropy. Of the $229 billion that individuals donated that year, about half went to religious institutions.Given our support for houses of worship, it seems reasonable to ask how much the various holy books would have us give. Perhaps the best-known prescription for giving is the Mormon practice of tithing, where members give 10 percent of their income to the church each year.The concept of tithing appears in several places in the Bible, including the book of Genesis, where Jacob promises to give a 10th of what he receives back to God. In Deuteronomy, meanwhile, there is the commandment to tithe “all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year.” The year-by-year yield does indeed sound like an ancient agrarian version of what we now think of as annual income.Muslims, however, take a different approach, according to Omid Safi, a professor of religion at the University of North Carolina. In Islam, there is a required charitable contribution known as Zakat, but instead of tapping income, the Koran specifies a donation of one-fortieth (2.5 percent) of one’s accumulated wealth each year.I think the Koran has it right, and the financial planner Brent Kessel helps explain why in his book “It’s Not About the Money.” He offers  the example of a person with $10 million in land that generates no income and $5,000 in monthly pensions and then cites a chef who earns $180,000, but has no savings. Shouldn’t the land baron be giving away more each year?Mr. Kessel suggests a baseline standard of 10 percent of income or 1 percent of net worth, whatever is greater. Peter Singer, a bioethics professor at Princeton who argued forcefully for devoting more individual resources to ending global poverty in his book “The Life You Can Save,” raised concerns  that some assets were illiquid or unavailable until later in life.Instead, Mr. Singer proposes a progressive scale based on income. Once it hits six figures and beyond, he says you should give away higher and higher percentages of each incremental dollar earned.What if your income is low and your assets are few? I’d try to value your time at an hourly rate, tally up any volunteer work you do and put that toward your quota.If you find these figures somewhat arbitrary, you can try a qualitative approach as well. Gary Anderson, a professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame, suggests looking to the letters that Gerard Manley Hopkins, a Jesuit priest and poet, wrote in the 19th century to Robert Bridges, a fellow poet who was not a believer.“He advised Hopkins that if he wanted to become familiar with the nature of Christian belief, to begin by giving alms and giving to the point of personal inconvenience, so that something that you wanted to do, you wouldn’t be able to do because you had given goods to the poor,” Mr. Anderson said. “It’s not giving to the point of utter impoverishment, but it’s not just giving pocket change either.”That standard, however, can be tough to square with the national penchant for procrastination, waiting until the end of the year to make a bunch of donations in time for the tax deadline or because the holiday spirit has set in between Thanksgiving and the new year. Paying all at once could easily lead to feelings of personal inconvenience at levels far lower than people would feel if they instead gave in equal bits throughout the year.So how would you go about doing that? Many nonprofit groups are happy to bill your credit card, in effect, every month. Or you can set up automatic bill payments through your online banking system. Network for Good is a service that can funnel recurring donations to a variety of recipients, though there’s generally a small fee involved.To my mind, however, an even better way to give would be through payroll deduction. It boggles the mind, frankly, that we can opt in to financial self-preservation through 401(k) and similar contributions, but generally cannot commit to selflessness through the same system.There are exceptions. Since 1978, I.B.M. employees have donated nearly $817 million through a custom-built payroll deduction system with 10,000 approved recipients. Employees can nominate new ones, and the company will add any registered nonprofit group to the list.Most companies aren’t big enough to build something like that, though. That is why it would be nice if a company like Fidelity stepped in to offer a similar service to companies. Why Fidelity? It does a big business in administering employee benefits systems for companies and also has a separate entity, the Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund, that offers donor-advised funds  where you can take an immediate tax deduction for deposits that you will give away later.So why doesn’t it link the two lines of business? The company said employers haven’t asked for it.  That said,  the gift fund operation has already set up individual employee charitable giving accounts at a few companies that deposit corporate funds for workers to give away as they wish.United Way, however, has run campaigns through payroll deduction for years, which suggests that there are plenty of employers with at least some interest in making it easier for their employees to give money away..Given how close we are to making this a widespread reality, I plan to knock on the door of my human resources department first thing Monday morning and ask that it find a way to let me and my colleagues give away money to whomever we choose through payroll deductions. I hope many of you will make the same request."
"How to Avoid, or Dispute, Surprise Medical Bills"," Vicki Cornford of Roscoe, Ill., had long experience dealing with medical bills. But even she was thrown for a loop by “balance billing.”First, some background. Ms. Cornford’s daughter Amber, now 21, was born with a rare bone disease that over the years has demanded constant monitoring, treatment and operations.As a result, Ms. Cornford has dealt with all manner of billing hassles, including denied claims, administrative errors and endless paperwork.But last fall, Amber, now a nursing student at Loyola University in Chicago and still covered under her father’s employer-sponsored health insurance plan, underwent yet another operation. A few weeks later, Ms. Cornford received a bill for about $500 from the anesthesiologist who treated her daughter.That seemed strange. Ms. Cornford was sure she had seen a claim for the anesthesiologist on a recent explanation of benefits statement from her insurer. But this new bill, it turned out, was for the remainder of the anesthesiologist’s fee not covered by Ms. Cornford’s insurance.“I’ve seen just about every mix-up possible over the years,” Ms. Cornford said. “But with this one I couldn’t understand why I was getting a bill.”Ms. Cornford would soon become very familiar with the phenomenon known as balance billing. It is a controversial and sometimes illegal practice: doctors and other providers receive a discounted payment from the insurance company — an amount less than the fee they want to be paid — and then they bill the patient for the rest. Most states, including Illinois, have passed laws making balance billing illegal within an insurer’s medical network.But balance billing can still happen. If you receive a bill from an in-network provider that you are not expecting, call your insurer immediately. “Your insurance company is the best enforcer, if you will, of these laws,” said Jane Cooper, chief executive of Patient Care, a Milwaukee patient advocate firm.Most cases occur when patients who are part of H.M.O.’s, P.P.O.’s and other network health care plans use an out-of-network doctor, lab hospital or other provider. H.M.O.’s, as a rule, will not cover any out-of-network fees unless for an emergency or for a pre-approved treatment so specialized that no one in the network can provide it. P.P.O.’s generally cover some percentage of out-of-network fees, usually 70 or 80 percent of so-called usual and customary charges.When an H.M.O. or a P.P.O. agrees to pay  an out-of-network surgeon, say, it is easy to be lulled into a false sense of security: Pre-approval means the entire bill will be paid, right? Maybe not.Instead, through the dark art of balance billing, you may discover — usually only when the bill arrives — that the provider is looking to collect more than the insurance company has agreed to pay. The recent federal overhaul of health insurance laws does not directly address the balance billing issue.“In many cases people just pay, figuring they owe the money and there’s nothing else they can do,” said Ms. Cooper. But there are ways to avoid balance billing in the first place — and to fight back if you believe this has happened to you.STAY IN NETWORK This is really the best way you can avoid extra charges, Ms. Cooper said.Of course, in many cases, particularly emergencies, you do not have a choice. But often patients will go to an outside doctor because of reputation or a recommendation from a family member or friend.“There may very well be a professional who is just as qualified in your network,” Ms. Cooper said. “Then you can be sure the cost will be fully covered.”DOUBLE-CHECK  The first time you visit a doctor or other health care provider, always call and verify that he or she is indeed in your network, Ms. Cooper suggested. Web sites can be outdated and mix-ups do happen. A physical therapist with two offices for instance, may be considered part of your network in only one of those locations.Erin Moaratty, a spokeswoman for the nonprofit Patient Advocate Foundation, notes that even if a hospital is in your network, some of the people who treat you there may not be.That is what happened to Ms. Cornford. Her daughter’s anesthesiologist sent the extra bill because he was not under contract with Ms. Cornford’s insurer. Ultimately, a patient advocate at Ms. Cooper’s firm helped persuade the anesthesiologist to agree to accept the discounted fee from the insurer.As best you can, you need to make sure before you are admitted to an in-network hospital that you will be treated by doctors, anesthesiologists, radiologists, physical therapists and other providers who are in your network. That way you will not get hit with any “balance” bills.NEGOTIATE UPFRONT If you know you must go out of network, be ready to talk money before you receive treatment, said Jennifer Jaff, executive director of Advocacy for Patients With Chronic Illness.Keep in mind that insurers pay according to what they deem are “usual and customary” fees for a particular treatment in your area. So if your P.P.O. plan pays 80 percent of out-of-network fees, this means 80 percent of “reasonable and customary” fees. If your doctor charges well above what the insurance company deems reasonable and customary, you may be balance-billed for the difference in addition to the co-payment you expected, for 20 percent of the reasonable and customary fees.Ask the out-of-network doctors (or their billing specialists) what the charge for your care will be. Then check with your insurer to see how that matches up with what it will pay for out-of-network service. Armed with this information, you can then negotiate with doctors upfront to accept the insurance company payment or ask if they will negotiate with the insurer directly.And if you want to use an out-of-network hospital, you’ll need to get pre-approval from your insurance company for all of the charges involved, not just your surgeon’s fee and the hospital charges.NEGOTIATE AFTERWARD, TOO When confronted with a balance bill, do not hesitate to call the doctor and discuss payment. Ask why he or she feels the insurance payment is not sufficient and why you were not informed of the excess fees ahead of time.Often, a provider will compromise, Ms. Cooper said. At the very least you can work out a payment plan and keep the bill out of collections.FILE AN APPEAL If you feel your insurance company is allocating too little toward your health care provider’s payment and you are shouldering too much of the fee, consider a more formal appeal that asks your insurance company to pay more, Ms. Moaratty suggested. This is especially true if you can justify the extra fee.Say, for example, complications resulted from a routine procedure and the treatment or surgery took much longer than expected. Or, if what started out as a routine doctor office visit actually entailed something more complicated. More information on how to file an appeal appeared in a Feb. 6 column, “Fighting Denied Claims Requires Perseverance.”"
"To Protect Consumers, Who Will Be Regulated?","WASHINGTON — An unlikely new tenant in the halls of the Federal Reserve would set out sweeping  rules on a wide swath of consumer transactions, possibly making it one of the most powerful new federal agencies in a generation.The proposed agency is causing concern and confusion, however, among owners of small businesses  —  drug stores, jewelers, pawnbrokers and car dealers — who fear that by allowing any customers to buy on credit, their businesses could be subject to significant new regulations.While most of the headlines about the Senate’s consideration of a financial regulation bill have concerned financial giants like Goldman Sachs and complex investments like synthetic collateralized debt obligations, the proposed Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which is a major part of the legislation,  is likely to be an intense battleground in coming weeks.Much of the bewilderment  —  and therefore the argument  —  stems from the imprecise nature of some of the proposed rules. The new agency would regulate financing provided by most car dealers, for example, but not by rent-to-own furniture vendors, according to the bill’s advocates. Department stores with private-label credit cards would be covered; stores that let their customers pay in installments, without interest, would not, they say.A review of the consumer protection provisions, which account for 335 pages of the 1,565-page bill, shows that the intent of the legislation is not to cover Main Street businesses. But the ambiguity of some terms  —  like the word “significantly”  —  leaves the regulations open to a broad interpretation.Senate Democrats and Obama administration officials say nearly all nonfinancial businesses would be exempt from the new bureau’s regulations, which would focus narrowly on consumer finance businesses.“There are a large number of different types of companies across the country involved in the finance business, consumer finance business, that took advantage of the current system and left people with financial obligations they did not understand, could not afford, were not appropriate for them, and the damage of that was catastrophic,” Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said at a Senate hearing on Thursday.But Republicans and business groups have countered that the new agency’s approach is scattershot rather than focused, and would stifle the ability of small Main Street businesses to offer credit to strapped customers.Rich Gallo, the owner of Office Outlet, an office products company in Indiana, Pa., said he regularly devised payment plans for his customers, and was concerned that the consumer agency would impose a new layer of regulation. Told that the bill’s advocates say his business would probably not be covered by the bureau, Mr. Gallo remained skeptical. “I just think that is the way our government seems to be going right now, to more regulation,” he said.The bill also would cast a broad net, opponents say, over companies that had little to do with the housing crisis and subsequent recession — a group known as nonbank financial companies, which includes such longtime Democratic targets as payday lenders, which make short-term loans at high interest rates.“There is growing concern that in an effort to hold Wall Street accountable, this bill could catch the little guys up in the same net as the big banks,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, said earlier this week after the Senate agreed to begin debate on the bill, formally known as the Restoring American Financial Stability Act.With its “ambiguous language,” Mr. McConnell added, “there is real concern that this bill could penalize anyone in this country who buys or sells something on an installment plan,” potentially subjecting any merchant that offers credit that is subject to a finance charge or extends over more than four installments to the authority of the consumer bureau.The crux of the debate would appear to rest on the definition of “significantly.” Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the primary sponsor of the bill, points to a section that says the new bureau cannot regulate “a merchant, retailer or seller of nonfinancial goods or services that is not engaged significantly in offering or providing consumer financial products or services.”That might seem to rule out auto dealers, which, after all, are principally engaged in selling cars and trucks. But roughly four out of every five car loans are generated by the dealers themselves, according to the Cambridge Winter Center for Financial Institutions Policy, a Washington research group that says it believes dealers should be covered by the agency. The dealers set the interest rate, and the loan fees that they earn are a big contributor to their profits.That, Democrats say, makes most auto dealers enough of a financial company to fall under the new bureau.Some small-business owners support the creation of the consumer agency, saying they are not threatened. “There is nothing onerous in these regulations,” said Lewis Prince, the owner of Vintage Vinyl, a St. Louis music retailer who participated in a news conference Wednesday sponsored by senators who support much of the Dodd bill. Consumer protection “can only help small business by providing the kind of stable financial environment in which small businesses can thrive,” Mr. Prince said.Even as businesses say the bill might be too far-reaching, some consumer advocates fear that the bureau will be able only to write rules, not enforce them. The bill would give the bureau enforcement powers over “larger participants” in nonbank or nonmortgage lines of business, like payday lending. How to define “larger” is left up to regulators.Both sides seem to agree that the consumer agency has an ample amount of independence — and maybe too much for some lawmakers. The bill states that the agency can demand that companies furnish information  about “the organization, business conduct, markets and activities of persons operating in the consumer financial services markets.”The bill would require  the Federal Reserve to turn over 10 percent of its operating budget each year to finance the agency. That would leave the new bureau with a budget of nearly $500 million  —  75 percent larger than the budget of the Federal Trade Commission, another agency that currently has consumer protection responsibilities.Whatever the new agency’s powers, businesses and their advocates in the Senate are more concerned over who will be regulated. “No one can deny that the language of the bill is ambiguous, that it lends itself to broad interpretation, so let’s tighten it up,” Mr. McConnell said. “The authors of this bill may believe some of these concerns are misplaced. But they are going to have to prove it.”"
F.D.I.C. Brokers the Sale of 3 Banks,"Federal regulators brokered the sale of three troubled lenders in Puerto Rico late Friday in an effort to fix the commonwealth’s broken banking system.After months of anticipation, officials from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation seized and then immediately sold the banks — Eurobank, R-G Premier Bank and Westernbank — which have been devastated by the region’s sluggish real estate market and a deep economic recession.Banco Popular, Puerto Rico’s biggest bank, picked up the bulk of Westernbank’s assets and deposits at a discounted price. R-G Premier was bought by Scotiabank of Canada, and Eurobank was acquired by the Oriental Financial Group. Those deals were made for slight premiums over the value of their deposits.Officials from the F.D.I.C. and the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions in Puerto Rico spent much of Friday trying to get out the message that depositors at all three troubled banks were protected. News of regulators’ takeover plans leaked earlier in the week as bids came due for an F.D.I.C.-run auction.The brokered deals were part of the government’s effort to strengthen Puerto Rico’s banking system by forcing consolidation, while weaning those lenders from high-cost deposits they obtain from the mainland to make loans.The acquired banks hold about one-quarter of Puerto Rico’s assets and deposits. Regulators feared that closing one separately from the others would set off bank runs on the island’s other lenders.Banco Popular, with its purchase of Westernbank, now holds more than 31 percent of the region’s deposits. That level of consolidation required special permission from the Federal Reserve Board before that deal could be completed.All of the buyers already operated in Puerto Rico and received loss-sharing agreements that made the F.D.I.C liable for the bulk of future losses associated with the purchased banks. The agency projects the effort to cost its insurance fund about $5.3 billion, $500 million less than it had anticipated.The F.D.I.C. will also make a financing program available to the bidders for up to five years, allowing them to replace expensive brokered deposits with low-cost funds supplied by the government. Officials said the program was necessary to protect the insurance fund, but said they had no plans to expand it to other transactions.In addition, regulators closed  four banks on the mainland on Friday evening, bringing the total number of failures this year to 64. F.D.I.C. officials said that they still expected to shutter more banks this year than the 140 banks that failed in 2009, although they noted that the pace of closings was slowing.“We are seeing signs of improvement,” Sheila C. Bair, the agency’s chairwoman,  told reporters by phone on Friday.In Puerto Rico, high unemployment, plummeting property values and gaping fiscal deficits have worsened the island’s ailing economy and added new urgency to the efforts to shore up its banks. As their losses piled up, nearly all local lenders pulled back on lending.Several banks in Puerto Rico, including Banco Popular and Oriental Financial, are healthier today after raising new capital in anticipation of the government-assisted deals. The consolidation effort, meanwhile, should bolster their financial prospects by reducing competition.Still, federal officials and analysts said a broader economic recovery for Puerto Rico could take years.“We think this will improve the health of the banking sector and improve its capacity to provide credit,” Ms. Bair said."
Chinese Rules Said to Threaten Proprietary Information,"BEIJING — China is expected to  issue regulations on Saturday requiring technology companies to disclose proprietary information like data-encryption keys and underlying software code to sell a range of security-related digital technology products to government agencies, American industry officials said on Friday.But they said it remained unclear how vigorously Chinese officials would enforce the new rules, which already are watered down from a sweeping proposal first raised in 2007. Both the American and European technology industries have contended that the rules are unworkable and that they amount to trade protectionism.One concern is that the rules will allow the leak of crucial foreign technologies to Chinese competitors who are seeking to build a technology industry on a par with the West.The European Union’s chief trade official, Karel De Gucht, said in a visit to Beijing this week that the rules had “no real base in reality,” and urged the Beijing government to overhaul them.The regulations, set to take effect on Friday, largely affect sales of network routers, smart cards, firewall software and other products involved in protecting digital data. They would require software and equipment from both Chinese and foreign companies to meet new technology standards before being certified for sale to government agencies.To be certified, companies apparently would have to give government-connected testing laboratories encryption algorithms, software source code and design specifications that, for many of the products, are regarded as sensitive trade secrets.In interviews, American industry officials argued that the rules not only sought details well beyond what was needed to certify the products, but that there were few safeguards to protect the proprietary information from outsiders.“Even if you’re not talking about the really sensitive stuff, it’s not clear yet how product information will be protected or secured while it is running through the testing process,” John Neuffer, a vice president at the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group based in Washington, said in a telephone interview.“China asks for companies to go through testing labs that are essentially state-owned, government-owned,” he said. “That’s the sensitive part.”The regulations are part of a long-running argument between Western technology companies and the Chinese government over the West’s access to Chinese markets. In the last month, China averted another dispute by rolling back a second plan aimed at giving Chinese companies an advantage in government technology purchases.But foreign companies still contend that the latest regulations will grant Chinese companies an unfair edge in government sales, a comparatively small but growing part of the market here.They also worry that the disclosure rules will enable Chinese competitors to copy Western technology.  When the 2007 certification proposal was first introduced, some Chinese officials cast it as part of a broader campaign to help the nation’s computer-technology companies gain ground against more advanced Western competitors.In negotiations, Chinese officials have argued that the United States imposes similar disclosure requirements on many advanced technologies. Mr. Neuffer and others said, however, that except for some military and national security technologies, American certification procedures are far less rigorous and are conducted in testing labs independent from the government.Other foreign critics have called the regulations an example of trade protectionism, in that they would set standards for selling goods to Chinese governments that Western companies find difficult to meet. Many Chinese technology companies  have agreed to abide by the rules.In Beijing, an American industry expert who has negotiated with the Chinese government on the issue said that most American companies were likely to abandon sales to the Chinese government rather than turn over trade secrets. That expert declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the talks with the Chinese.American industry officials also have argued that the new rules would gut their technology exports, because few other nations would purchase technology whose essential security secrets had been shared with the Chinese government.Publicly, the United States government has taken a muted stance on the dispute. Nkenge Harmon, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative in Washington, noted in a statement that the Chinese first planned to apply the rules to all technology purchases, but later scaled them back to apply only to purchases by local, provincial and national governments.“We were pleased with that decision,” her statement said. “Since then, the U.S. has continued to ask China to follow global norms in this area, and we are continuing those discussions.”"
Chevron Quarterly Profit Doubles,"The Chevron Corporation’s quarterly profit more than doubled, beating forecasts, as a rise in oil prices offset lower refinery earnings.The oil company’s chief financial officer, Patricia E. Yarrington, said on Friday that she saw some softening in the West Coast and Singapore refining markets going into the second quarter.“You may still have some sloppiness in the market,” she told analysts on a conference call, referring to how refining capacity under maintenance was coming back on line.Oil and gas production climbed to 2.78 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the quarter, up 120,000 barrels a day. The company increased its output in the United States, Nigeria, Angola and at Tengiz in Kazakhstan.Chevron is aiming for average production of 2.73 million barrels  a day for 2010, and said it would discuss this outlook further at the second-quarter earnings conference call in July.Chevron and other oil companies’ offshore operations are coming under increased scrutiny because of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico at a BP well. The White House said it would not open new regions to drilling until the cause of the disaster had been determined.Ms. Yarrington said Chevron, a major Gulf of Mexico producer, was assisting BP and the  government, but that it was too early to say how the situation would play out.First-quarter  profit rose to $4.55 billion, or $2.27 a share, from $1.84 billion, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 34 percent, to $46.7 billion.Excluding $175 million in charges for job cuts, the company earned $2.36 a share, easily topping the $1.94 that analysts had expected, according to the average on Thomson Reuters.The company’s downstream, or refining and marketing business, posted profits of $82 million in the quarter, down from $136 million a year earlier, but far better than the $333 million loss the previous quarter.Most of the world’s major private-sector oil companies reported stronger-than-expected profits this week, though the market leader Exxon Mobil  was hurt by a weak refining performance and  a charge for health reform costs.Shares of Chevron closed down 85 cents, to $81.44."
Builder D.R. Horton Swings to a Profit,"The home builder D. R. Horton reported a quarterly profit and a sharp increase in orders on Friday, surprising Wall Street and sending shares up across the sector.Horton, whose shares touched a nearly two-year high, extended a trend of improving results from home builders. The company, the second-largest home builder in the country, constructs  ready-to-sell homes. That enabled it to capture any increase in demand fueled by the tax credit. Orders rose more than analysts expected as Horton exploited urgency on the part of buyers rushing to meet the tax credit deadline. Orders are an important leading indicator for home builders, as contracts signed in one quarter often do not close until the next.Pulte, which became the country’s largest builder after its acquisition of Centex, is expected to report results next week.Horton reported a net income of $11.4 million, or 4 cents a share, reversing a year-earlier loss of $108.6 million, or 34 cents a share. It was second consecutive profitable quarter after almost three years of losses.The results topped Wall Street’s expectations, as analysts had forecast a loss of 1 cent a share, according to Thomson Reuters.Revenue rose 15.7 percent, to $896.8 million.Relatively conservative builders, who prefer to wait until they have a buyer before building, were at a disadvantage this quarter because builders must deliver homes by June 30 to qualify them for the tax credit.For instance, the Ryland Group posted a 13.4 percent drop in orders when it reported results on Wednesday and shares fell about 4 percent the next day.Horton’s shares were up 3.2 percent to $14.69."
Belgium Plant Closing Costs G.M. Millions,"General Motors said on Friday that the costs of closing a plant in Antwerp, Belgium, would run 400 million euros ($532 million). The costs would largely involve paying termination benefits covering 2,600 workers. It also said a search led by the Flemish government would be conducted until the end of September to try to sell the plant to an outside investor."
Insurer Allowed to Sue Countrywide,"MBIA can proceed with a lawsuit claiming that Countrywide Financial committed fraud in obtaining insurance on billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities, a judge ruled. MBIA’s suit contends that  Countrywide “falsely represented” to the insurer, and to trusts holding the securities, that Countrywide originated the mortgage loans in strict compliance with its underwriting standards. The insurer has covered more than $459 million of losses."
Apple to Shut Down Lala Music Site,"Lala, the online music service, will be shut down on May 31, five months after Apple bought the start-up. Apple is widely expected to use Lala’s “cloud” technology to integrate a Web subscription service into its popular iTunes Music Store.  A notice on Lala’s Web site on Friday said it would issue refunds to users who had already paid for songs they had yet to download."
Lyondell Chemical Exits Bankruptcy,"Lyondell Chemical said on Friday that it had exited bankruptcy after 16 months. Its debt load was reduced to about $5 billion from $24 billion.  It was able to exit through financial backing from two private equity firms and the industrial holding company Access Industries.  The new company, LyondellBasell Industries, will be based in the Netherlands and will trade in New York later this year."
New Publisher Named for the Philadelphia Inquirer,"The former Newsweek publisher Greg Osberg was named publisher of The Philadelphia Inquirer’s parent company after creditors won an auction to buy the business in bankruptcy. Mr. Osberg, 52, will also be chief executive of Philadelphia Newspapers, owner of The Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News and Philly.com, pending approval of the sale in bankruptcy court."
Job Cuts at ABC Leave Workers Stunned and Downcast,"If “Good Morning America” or “World News” look any different in the coming weeks, it might be because ABC News is employing nearly 400 fewer people.Earlier this week, ABC News, a unit of the Walt Disney Company, largely completed one of the most drastic rounds of budget cutbacks at a television news operation in decades, affecting roughly a quarter of the staff. The cutbacks promise to change ABC both on- and off-camera.For some employees, like the longtime Los Angeles correspondent Brian Rooney, Friday was their last day. Mr. Rooney said his contract expired at “exactly the moment when they needed to shed an enormous amount from the payroll.” In an e-mail message, he compared it to “standing looking straight up when the bomb dropped.”Personally, he said, the next step is scary. “I’m 58 years old with a wife, two daughters in school and a little dog who likes to be fed. They have cut me loose into the worst economy in my lifetime,” he said.The business of news is a particularly ugly one these days, and news outlets across the country have trimmed their staffs. But it is exceedingly rare for a newspaper or a network to shed a quarter of its employees all at once, as ABC has done.For viewers, the effects will be felt on the individual broadcasts, like “World News with Diane Sawyer,” which lost two of its six senior staff members to buyouts. They will not be replaced.In the future, more segments will be reported, filmed and edited by jacks-of-all-trades, called digital journalists, internally. They may lack the polish that a traditional four-person crew can provide, but they are much less expensive. Sometimes two of the digital journalists will team up for reports.“We are now, as a work force, becoming much more flexible,” said Jon Banner, the executive producer of “World News.”David Westin,  the ABC News president, said  that Mr. Banner was having each of his producers trained as digital journalists. But he emphasized that there was still a place for veteran videographers and editors at ABC.Other changes may be more subtle to viewers. More interviews will happen via Skype, rather than an expensive satellite truck. Prime-time shows will rely more heavily on freelance employees. More assignments will be made from a centralized office in New York, rather than by far-flung bureaus, because some of those bureaus have been severely downsized.Buyouts were announced in February as the prospect of layoffs loomed, and Mr.  Westin made no secret of the fact that they would result in a leaner, smaller organization, a bid for survival in a crowded media landscape.More than 300 employees were approved for buyout packages. An unknown number were laid off. A person with knowledge of the cutbacks said 22 staff employees were laid off on Tuesday in a final round of cuts, but ABC would not disclose the numbers.Morale is very low, according to some of the dozen ABC News staff members who agreed to be interviewed for this article. Most spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized by ABC to speak publicly.People are “walking around like they’ve been punched in the gut,” one of the employees said, referring to people still with jobs.Mr. Westin acknowledged in an interview on Friday that “this is a difficult time for everybody at ABC News, not least for the people who are leaving.”“At the same time, we really are looking forward to the future,” he said.Inside ABC News, it is widely believed that the cutbacks were mandated by Disney. The cuts came shortly after CBS News, one of the other three network news divisions, lost about 70 staff members. The third division, NBC, is in a much better financial position because it has a cable news arm, MSNBC.Amid the buyout and layoff process, there has been widespread speculation about a potential pairing between ABC News and the Bloomberg TV cable channel. The two already share some content. Mr. Westin said ABC regularly talks to Bloomberg and another partner, the BBC, “about whether there are ways we can expand” their relationships, but “there’s no major change that’s imminent.”Richard Gizbert, a former ABC correspondent who now is host of a weekly media criticism show on Al Jazeera English, said the extent of the cutbacks stunned some former ABC employees. He noted that ABC’s London bureau, which is responsible for covering Europe and Africa and which employed about 100 people in the early 1990s, had already suffered a series of cuts over the years, and will soon employ barely a dozen people.“Yet there’s no fewer broadcasts,” Mr. Gizbert noted.(Mr. Gizbert’s contract was not renewed by ABC in 2004, and he lost a lawsuit against the network in 2006.)Already, some bureaus, like Los Angeles, have been reduced significantly. Along with Mr. Rooney, other departing correspondents include Betsy Stark, Lisa Fletcher and Laura Marquez.But ABC executives sharply disagreed with suggestions that the news division was throwing up its hands.“The entire news industry is at a crossroads right now,” Mr. Westin said. In ABC’s case, rather than simply reducing headcount, “this is, ‘Let’s redefine jobs and what people do and what their skills are.’ ”But to Mr. Rooney, the title of digital journalist is “really a code for cheaper and less professional.”“Good television news is expensive to do,” he wrote. “The shorter the deadline, the more people and equipment it takes. In the western states in particular, it would be very challenging for one or two people to shoot, write, edit and feed a breaking news story by 3:30 in the afternoon. Wildfires tend to happen in places where there is no cellphone coverage and no Starbucks with free Wi-Fi.” Despite his skepticism about the digital journalist strategy, Mr. Rooney said he believed that Mr. Westin was “trying to save ABC News.”“I hope they succeed,” he said, “although I like to think they will have a harder time doing it without me.”"
"Angus Maddison, Economic Historian, Dies at 83","Some people try to forecast the future. Angus Maddison devoted his life to forecasting the past.Professor Maddison, a British-born economic historian with a compulsion for quantification, spent many of his 83 years calculating the size of economies over the last three millenniums.   In one study he estimated the size of the world economy in A.D. 1 as about one five-hundredth  of what it was in 2008.He died on April 24 at a hospital in Paris after a long illness, his daughter, Elizabeth Maddison, said. He lived near Compiègne, about 50 miles  northeast of Paris.Professor Maddison held various senior posts at what is now the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international research and consulting organization based in Paris. Most recently he was a professor at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.He also spent much of his career studying economic conditions in the developing world firsthand, living for extended periods in Pakistan, Ghana, Brazil, Mongolia and Guinea, among other nations. As an adviser, he helped emerging market governments determine how to measure their economic progress and improve  policies.In his research, he tried to reconstruct thousands of years’ worth of economic data, most notably in his  2007 book “Contours of the World Economy 1-2030 A.D..”  He argued that per capita income around the globe had remained largely stagnant  from about 1000 to 1820, after which the world became exponentially richer and life expectancies surged.In another influential book, “Chinese Economic Performance in the Long Run,” in 1998,  he tracked the history of Chinese growth since  960. The book  demonstrated that China’s recent rise was merely a return to economic superpowerdom, as the Middle Kingdom had already dominated the world economy for many centuries.In his archaeological excavation of the  economies of other eras, he was “trying to explain why some countries achieved faster growth or higher income levels than others,” he wrote in an autobiographical essay, “Confessions of a Chiffrephile”   published in 1994.  He wanted to know what some countries did right and what others did wrong, and to figure out how growth influenced culture, and was influenced by it.Professor Maddison often referred to himself as a “chiffrephile,”  or lover of numbers,  a term he invented to characterize economists and economic historians like himself who were prone to quantifying the world.While macroeconomic research in the last few decades was dominated by elegant mathematical models and technical wizardry, his focus on meat-and-potatoes data and cross-country historical comparisons has come back into vogue in recent years, especially in the wake of the financial crisis.Social class and inequality figured greatly in his research and personal memoirs, perhaps reflecting his early childhood in economically depressed Newcastle-upon-Tyne,  a shipbuilding and mining town in northeastern England, where he was born on Dec. 6, 1926.His parents both left school at age 12. His father, a railway fitter, and his mother   invested in their only child’s intellectual development, taking him to scholarly lectures sponsored by the local cooperative movement. One lecture introduced him to the work of the British economist John Maynard Keynes.Professor Maddison’s first collegiate pursuit was history, but he was drawn to economics because he realized it was a “useful discipline for solving serious problems,” he wrote in his autobiography.He enrolled in Cambridge in 1945, on a scholarship supplemented by a part-time job lecturing    to German prisoners of war. He later attended graduate school at McGill University in Montreal and the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, then decided to return to Britain.In subsequent years he lectured at universities, including the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, and worked with  the   what is now the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard University. He retired from the University of Groningen in 1996, but he was still pursuing his research until three weeks before he died, his daughter, Elizabeth, said.Besides his daughter, Professor Maddison is survived by his wife, Penelope; two sons, George and Charles, who is also an economist; and five grandchildren."
Children’s Tylenol and Other Drugs Recalled,"A unit of Johnson & Johnson has voluntarily begun a recall of certain children’s over-the-counter liquid medicines because of manufacturing deficiencies, the Food and Drug Administration said on Saturday.The deficiencies may affect the potency, purity or quality of the products, the agency said in a statement. It said it was investigating the plant where the products were made to make sure there were no other problems.Consumers should stop using certain lots of infants’ and children’s Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl products because some of them may contain more  of the active drug ingredient than specified, the Johnson & Johnson unit, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, said in a statement late Friday. Other products involved in the recall may contain foreign particles or inactive ingredients that may not meet testing requirements, the company said.“The particles may be solidified product ingredients or manufacturing residue such as tiny metal specks,” Marc Boston, a McNeil spokesman, said.McNeil did not undertake the recall because of adverse health reactions to the products, the company said, but it advised consumers  to stop using them.Although the potential for serious medical problems is remote, McNeil said, parents and caregivers should not give the products to children.The recall involves all unexpired lots of seven products in 43 different flavors and sizes. These include Tylenol Infants’ Drops, Children’s Tylenol Suspensions, Infants’ Motrin Drops, Children’s Zyrtec liquids in bottles and Children’s Benadryl Allergy liquids.McNeil has posted a full list of the recalled product lots on a dedicated Web site: mcneilproductrecall.com. The recall comes after federal health regulators cited McNeil on Friday morning for manufacturing violations found during a routine inspection at a company facility in Fort Washington, Pa., an F.D.A. spokeswoman said. This is the second major recall this year for McNeil. In January, after receiving reports of moldy smells emanating from over-the-counter medicines made at a plant in Puerto Rico, the company recalled several hundred lots of adult and children’s products. The earlier recall involved certain lots of Benadryl, Motrin, Rolaids, Simply Sleep, St. Joseph Aspirin and Tylenol.McNeil has a hotline,  (888) 222-6036, available 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern time, Monday through Friday and on  weekends from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  But due to high call volumes, a reporter  who called the hotline at different times on Saturday was unable to reach a customer service representative. A recorded  message directed callers to the company’s Web site and later disconnected. McNeil said it was working to respond to the high call volumes."
Buffett Offers Support of Goldman at Meeting,"Warren E. Buffett became the highest-profile defender of Goldman Sachs on Saturday, offering staunch support of the firm as it combats fraud charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission.Mr. Buffett also strongly defended the firm’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, saying he did not think Mr. Blankfein needed to be replaced.His support for Goldman came in a question-and-answer session at the annual meeting in Omaha of Berkshire Hathaway, the giant insurance and investment firm Mr. Buffett runs. Berkshire owns $5 billion of preferred stock in Goldman.The S.E.C. suit against Goldman stems from a complex investment deal the firm put together in 2007. The Justice Department has also begun a preliminary inquiry into Goldman’s mortgage activities before the financial crisis, according to people briefed on the matter.Goldman denies any wrongdoing. Yet the firm has been battered by the S.E.C.’s charges, having lost about $21 billion in market value in the two weeks since the regulator filed its suit.Berkshire’s annual meeting has become a sort of Woodstock for capitalists, drawing tens of thousands of investors each year. In a packed auditorium, Mr. Buffet was questioned for almost five hours by shareholders and a panel of journalists that included a reporter for The New York Times.In wide-ranging comments that spanned from Goldman to a proposed overhaul of financial regulation to Greece’s debt crisis, Mr. Buffett said the global economy had largely improved. That was reflected in Berkshire’s first-quarter results: $3.6 billion in net income, a sharp swing from the $1.5 billion loss it posted at the same time last year.Still, what drew the most attention was Mr. Buffett’s full-throated support for Goldman. He drew upon some of the same points that Goldman has used in its own defense, including the sophistication of the investors the S.E.C. says were defrauded by Goldman’s lack of adequate disclosure in the deal. He said those investors should have conducted better due diligence. Of one investor, he said, “It’s hard for me to get terribly sympathetic when a bank makes a dumb credit bet.”He also stood behind Mr. Blankfein. When asked whom he would select if Goldman needed to find a new leader, Mr. Buffett replied, “If Lloyd had a twin brother, I would vote for him.”Mr. Buffett has a significant investment in Goldman. In 2008, during the depths of the financial crisis, Berkshire invested $5 billion in preferred shares. Those  shares carry a 10 percent interest rate, meaning that Berkshire is earning about $500 million a year from its holdings. (Or as Mr. Buffett put it, $15 a second.)Though Mr. Buffett said the S.E.C. lawsuit had not yet negatively influenced his opinion of Goldman, he said he would revise his thinking if new evidence came to light.Mr. Buffett added that Goldman is a longtime adviser that “helped build Berkshire Hathaway” by selling them businesses for more than 50 years.Mr. Buffett’s longtime lieutenant, Charles Munger, tempered his boss’s kind words. Mr. Munger, Berkshire’s vice chairman, said that  there is a difference between behaving legally and behaving ethically — and that a business should not simply follow the former.Mr. Buffett also weighed in on the financial regulation overhaul bill that is pending in the Senate, which include provisions that may force investors in derivatives contracts to add more collateral to their holdings. (Berkshire has lobbied against such provisions.) Mr. Buffett said that Berkshire was unlikely to be forced to “put up a dime” in additional money on its existing contracts, though he added that the firm would do so if required."
Driving Shifts Into Reverse,"Economists have long studied the relationship between driving habits and gasoline prices. Low gas prices can bring periods of profligate driving, and a quick jump in prices can cause many vehicles to languish in garages.Until recently, Americans have driven more each year than the previous one, with a few brief exceptions. In 1956, Americans of driving age drove about 4,000 miles a year, on average. Fifty years later, that figure had climbed above 10,000.But the latest recession has caused some big changes. High unemployment meant that fewer people were driving to work, and a slump in consumer spending meant that less freight needed to be moved around the country. As gas prices soared in 2005, the number of miles driven - including commercial and personal - began to fall, and continued to drop after 2008 even as gasoline became cheaper.""People were surprised by the very rapid rise in gas prices, and they changed their driving behavior,"" said Kenneth A. Small, a transportation economist at the University of California, Irvine. ""But my suspicion is that it is temporary. As soon as unemployment gets back to pre-recession levels, we will see Americans doing a lot more driving again."
Slate of Nominees Is Clue to Obama’s Plans for Fed,"WASHINGTON — In naming two economists and a lawyer to serve as governors of the Federal Reserve, President Obama and his top economic advisers are preparing the central bank for a new emphasis on the supervision of financial institutions.The financial crisis that led the Fed to hurl money at the economy and prop up the housing market also exposed a past inattention to regulation. The backgrounds and expertise of the nominees, announced on Thursday, suggest the Obama administration is trying to address that shortcoming.Only one of the three, Janet L. Yellen, specializes in the setting of interest rates and the supply of credit, the Fed’s traditional bailiwick.The other economist, Peter A. Diamond, is an authority on Social Security and pensions who was a graduate school mentor of Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed’s chairman, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The lawyer, Sarah Bloom Raskin, Maryland’s commissioner of financial regulation, is an ally of consumer advocacy groups, which believe that the Fed’s neglect abetted the subprime lending crisis that metastasized into the most damaging downturn since the Depression.“It’s a well-rounded group, and a reflection of the fact that given the events of recent history, the importance of the Fed’s financial stability role, relative to its role in gauging traditional cyclical tradeoffs, is likely higher now,” Lawrence H. Summers, director of the National Economic Council, who oversaw the search, said in an interview.Even as it continues to try to battle joblessness and hold down inflation, the Fed is poised to receive new duties from Congress for protecting the financial system and consumers. Mr. Obama’s selections reflect these duties, but also are consistent with the mandate set out for the Fed at its creation in 1913, said Jon Faust, a former Fed official.“The Federal Reserve Act envisioned that the board would represent a broad range of interests,” said Mr. Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins. “The emphasis on academic economists is a trend that’s only been happening in central banks around the world over the last 15 to 20 years.”So far there has not been vocal criticism of the nominees, whose backgrounds were reviewed for a month and a half before the appointments were formally announced. If the three are confirmed, they will join Mr. Bernanke, whom Mr. Obama backed for a second term; Daniel K. Tarullo, a law professor and an authority on banking regulation, whom Mr. Obama named to the seven-member board last year; and two Republican governors named by President George W. Bush.“We ran a careful and thoughtful selection process,” Mr. Summers said. “We considered a large number of people, and all of us on the economic team felt this slate would be very strong.”Daniel P. Carpenter, professor of government at Harvard, said that as an authority on fiscal matters, Mr. Diamond, who is close to Peter R. Orszag, Mr. Obama’s budget director, “can speak with greater credibility” than Mr. Bernanke on taxation and spending.The fact that Mr. Bernanke, 56, has known and admired Mr. Diamond, who just turned 70, for more than three decades adds a wrinkle to the dynamics on the board.“In academic culture, no matter how advanced you are or how many awards you’ve won, people look up to their academic advisers,” Mr. Carpenter said. “This is going to be a vote on the board of governors that is going to have special weight.”Mr. Carpenter predicted that Ms. Raskin would elevate the prominence of consumer concerns at a time when Congress was considering housing a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau within the Fed.“There are at the root level a number of consumer capacities at the Fed, including bank examiners and regulators at the regional banks,” Mr. Carpenter said. “The problem is that a lot of these lower-level regulatory functionaries tend not to get the attention or status that the high-level monetary policy-making functionaries get.”J. Kevin Corder, a political scientist at Western Michigan University who studies Fed policy-making, agreed that the board needed to go beyond monetary policy.“The monetary policy function has been so overwhelmed by the regulatory challenges and the extraordinary interventions that the board is drawing on different types of expertise than it has in the past,” Mr. Corder said.For Ms. Yellen, who was a Fed governor from 1994 to 1997 and then chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton, the appointment amounts to a homecoming.“I am strongly committed to pursuing the dual goals that Congress has assigned us: maximum employment and price stability,” Ms. Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco since 2004, said on Thursday. “And, if confirmed, I will work to ensure that policy promotes job creation and keeps inflation in check.”The positioning of employment before inflation in that statement might fuel a perception that Ms. Yellen is an inflation “dove,” more concerned about the 9.7 percent unemployment rate than the prospect of inflation jitters.But Laurence H. Meyer, an economist who served with Ms. Yellen on the board, called that depiction an exaggeration.Before the Fed’s policy-making arm met in September 1996, he recalled, he and Ms. Yellen paid an unusual visit to Alan Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke’s predecessor.“Janet and I were both worried about inflation, even though it was very well contained at the time,” Mr. Meyer wrote in a blog post last month. “We told the chairman that we loved him but could not remain at his side much longer if he continued, as he had been doing for some time, to push the next tightening action into the next meeting, and then not follow through.”Mr. Meyer and Ms. Yellen ultimately stood by Mr. Greenspan, who had correctly predicted that technological change was fueling a boom in productivity and alleviating inflationary pressures. The Fed did not raise its benchmark interest rate until the following March."
Stolen Facebook Accounts for Sale,"Researchers at VeriSign’s iDefense division tracking the digital underworld say bogus and stolen accounts on the Facebook are now on sale in high volume on the black market.During several weeks in February, iDefense tracked an effort to sell log-in data for 1.5 million Facebook accounts on several online criminal marketplaces, including one called Carder.su.That  hacker, who used the screen name “kirllos” and appears to deal only in Facebook accounts, offered to sell bundles of 1,000 accounts with 10 or fewer friends for $25 and with more than 10 friends for $45, says Rick Howard, iDefense’s director of cyber intelligence.The case points to a significant expansion in the illicit market for social networking accounts from Eastern Europe  to the United States, he said.Criminals steal log-in data for Facebook accounts, typically with “phishing”  techniques that tricks users into disclosing their passwords or with malware  that logs keystrokes. They then use the accounts to send spam, distribute malicious programs and run identity and other fraud.Facebook says it believes that the  hacker’s claims to control large numbers  of Facebook accounts are bogus. The  company attempted to purchase accounts as part of its investigation into the  incident, said a spokesman, Barry  Schnitt. However, “the hacker was unable to produce anything for our buyer,”  he said.Facebook’s investigators also discovered that “kirllos” has a reputation  “for wild claims,” he said.“We would expect iDefense or anyone  presenting themselves as a security expert to do this kind of verification (or any  verification) rather than just reading a  forum post and accepting the claims as fact and publicizing them,” Mr. Schnitt  said in an e-mail message.IDefense could not be immediately  reached for comment on the legitimacy  of the hacker’s offer. However, it previously said that it did not purchase any of  the accounts as part of its study because that would violate its corporate policy.Criminals  steal log-in data for Facebook accounts, typically with “phishing” techniques   that tricks users into disclosing their passwords or with malware that logs keystrokes. They then use the accounts to send spam, distribute malicious programs and run identity and other fraud.Facebook accounts are attractive because of the higher level of trust on the site than exists in the broader Internet. People are required to use their real names and tend to connect primarily with people they know.As a result, they are more likely to believe a fraudulent message or click on a dubious link on a friend’s wall or an e-mail message. Moreover, the accounts allow criminals to mine profiles of victims and their friends for personal information like birth dates, addresses, phone numbers, mothers’ maiden names, pets’ names and other tidbits that can be used in identity theft.Last summer, Eileen Sheldon’s Facebook account was hacked and used to send messages to about 20 friends claiming she was stranded in  Britain without a passport and needed money. Ms. Sheldon, who lives in California, had recently been living in London, and one friend, believing the ruse, wired about $100 to the thieves.Other friends smelled a fraud and warned Ms. Sheldon, who quickly reported the problem to Facebook.  She does not know how her password was stolen.While the accounts that were compromised and offered for sale could be legitimate ones like Ms. Sheldon’s, they  most likely also included bogus accounts,  Mr. Howard said. IDefense did not see  the accounts themselves, but the inclusion of many accounts with small numbers of friends suggests the seller could  have created fake accounts, perhaps using an automated tool, and sent out blind  friend requests.Many users are eager to amass friends and accept friend requests from people they do not know, even though Facebook discourages it.Facebook says it has sophisticated systems to defeat fake accounts, including tools for flagging them when they are created so they can be investigated. This allows Facebook to “disable them before the bad guys get very far,” a  spokesman, Simon Axten, said.Facebook also monitors for unusual activity that is associated with fake accounts, like many friend requests in a short period of time and high rates of friend requests that are ignored. It also investigates reports of suspicious users .The relatively low asking prices for the Facebook accounts points to the fact that Facebook accounts do not translate into instant profit. “The people that buy these things are going to have to do more work to make money,” Mr. Axten said."
"In New York, a Tech Incubator Becomes a Hub of Collaboration","In 2008, before most people knew what a tweet was, Iain Dodsworth, a programmer in London, cobbled together a software tool that reorganized his jumbled Twitter stream into neat columns. He named it TweetDeck.Within a few months, it gained the kind of momentum most entrepreneurs only dream about. Tech bloggers praised it, and users flocked to it. Ashton Kutcher posted a video online showing him and his wife, Demi Moore, using the service.It wasn’t long before inquiries from investors began pouring in.“It was fairly scary,” he said. “I was a one-man company being thrown offers left, right and center from people I didn’t know.”But then Mr. Dodsworth received a message from a company he did recognize: Betaworks, a New York City technology firm known for its eye for emerging Web services.“Money is nice, but I actually needed expertise more than anything else,” he said. “Betaworks had a track record in this field back when no one had a track record in this field.”In the two years since then, Betaworks has become prominent in New York technology circles for helping entrepreneurs fine-tune and expand their companies. The company has guided some entrepreneurs to lucrative sales and helped others raise cash from notable New York and Silicon Valley investment firms.Such incubators are familiar in more established tech hubs. Silicon Valley, for example, has the technology incubator Y Combinator, and Pasadena has Idealab.“Historically, there have been more biotech incubators in New York than other technology incubators,” said Jonathan Bowles, the director of the Center for an Urban Future, which has studied the economic development of New York and other cities. “New York has long lacked local investors who are also rooted here and committed to building a sustainable technology community. Betaworks is starting to fill a void that’s been lacking in New York since the ’90s.”The company was founded by John Borthwick and Andrew Weissman, who worked at AOL in the ’90s.“I was there when AOL bought CompuServe and Netscape and did the first content deal with Amazon,” said Mr. Weissman, chief operating officer. “You could start to see these new ways pieces of the Internet were coming together.”He said he watched as one AOL project, MapQuest, gradually lost market share. Google Maps grew faster because it allowed other companies to add information to a map or use the service in other tools. “You could just see that model was going to be big,” “We said, ‘We think this is it, and we want to invest in these kinds of companies.’ ”A little over three years ago, the two decided they wanted to create their own company aimed at that very idea. Thanks to tools like Amazon Web Services, Twitter and Google Apps, developers could more easily build and scale Web tools.“We knew there was a big fundamental change happening on the Internet,” said Mr. Borthwick, Betaworks’ chief executive. “And we knew it was going to be social.”They spent nine months deliberating over how to structure their company before settling on a hybrid of an investment firm and an incubator.“The venture capital structure is banking on finding that one super-duper winner, and there’s nothing wrong with that,” said Mr. Borthwick. “But our goal is to create a network of companies with lots of connections between them that increases the likelihood of success between all of them.”It’s not hard to see that spirit at work. The two dozen companies under Betaworks’ umbrella make a point of using one another’s creations and often incorporate them into their own services. At a recent meeting at Betaworks, about three dozen employees of Betaworks and its portfolio of companies crowded into a room, trading feedback, updates and the occasional good-natured zinger about their various products.Betaworks has developed some Web tools from scratch, like Bit.ly, a URL shortener, and Chartbeat, a real-time Web analytics service. But the company is looking for entrepreneurs who have more than a vision.“Anyone who shows up with an idea on a napkin, we’re going to tell them, ‘Thanks, but go build a prototype,’ ” Mr. Weissman said.Betaworks, he said, will focus on five to 10 companies a year. The company has taken on some investors, most recently raising $20 million. The New York Times Company invested in that round of financing.Investors rely on the keen eye of Betaworks to provide a window into the next wave of promising Web companies, said Jim Robinson, a partner at RRE Ventures, a technology investment firm. “It’s a great sifter and feeder system for us,” he said. “We’re able to see these interesting companies when they’re young and track them as they develop.”The best marker of Betaworks’ success is Summize, a small start-up that allowed users to search through Twitter’s ever-flowing stream of posts. Betaworks first invested in the company in December 2007 and continued helping to develop it. Twitter bought the service in July 2008 for a reported $15 million.Betaworks created Bit.ly at the request of its portfolio of companies that wanted a secure, reliable way to shorten unwieldy Web addresses.As the service quickly ballooned beyond the network of Betaworks companies, Mr. Borthwick and Mr. Weissman raised $3.5 million in venture financing for the company and spun out into a stand-alone business, although its team still works in Betaworks’ office. “It may look like the incubators of yesteryear in here,” said Mr. Borthwick, gesturing to the scribbled-on chalkboards, the cushy lounge chairs and the fishtank shaped like the MTV logo.“We don’t operate anything like a factory,” he said. “There’s no production line, and we’re not trying to blow out 40 companies this year.”"
Google Sees a New Role for YouTube: An Outlet for Live Sports,"NEW DELHI, India — The Indian Premier League, an 8-team tournament here that turns staid cricket into something fast-paced and glamorous, just ended its third season with a new champion, the Chennai Super Kings, and a new scandal revolving around allegations of financial fraud.But for Google India, the series was a big hit.Google’s subsidiary YouTube carried the league’s 60 matches live around the world, except in the United States, the first time the company has broadcast a major sporting event. About 50 million viewers tuned in to YouTube’s I.P.L. channel, 25 percent more than Google executives said they expected when they signed the deal in January. Approximately 40 percent of those viewers were outside India.Google signed on seven advertisers in India, including Coca-Cola and Hewlett-Packard, two in Britain and one in the United States, where YouTube showed matches 15 minutes after they finished.Now Google is shopping for other events to show on YouTube in real time, a plan that could shake up the sports broadcasting world. To date, though, live sports viewing on the Internet has been hampered by slow broadband speeds, and the reluctance of sports leagues to cannibalize profits that come from traditional broadcasters. Some broadcasters, like ESPN, predominantly show events online that they do not carry on television.Until now, YouTube has concentrated mainly on amateur user-created content, professional music videos and short promotional clips from television shows. The only major international event it carried live before the I.P.L. was a U2 concert from the Rose Bowl in Pasadena last year, but it did not have corporate sponsors or pay the band a fee.Now, though, YouTube could carry concerts and games from around the globe. Google will be looking at “more live events and live sports,” said Shailesh Rao, managing director of Google India, in a recent interview in his office in Gurgaon, the outsourcing boomtown south of New Delhi. Many sports leagues noticed the cricket tournament’s successful webcast, he said, and Google is having “new conversations with lots of folks.”Live sports on the Internet have several obvious advantages over television  —   they can be watched anywhere, including from an office cubicle. And fans can discuss plays with other fans from around the globe through comments and posts.Mr. Rao of Google said YouTube’s live broadcasts of sports events would “turn the world into your office water cooler.”Because of  improvements in  technology, sports fans are in the middle of a “quantum shift,” said Damien Stenmark, the founder of the Stenmark Organisation, a marketing company in Sydney that sells advertising time during sporting events. They are asking themselves, “which screen should I watch the sport on?” he said.Sports leagues will be “reveling in the fact that there is a brand new entrant to the market prepared to pay good money to the rights to quality sports,” Mr. Stenmark said.Broadcasters “cannot ignore it, they have to find a way to include it and embrace it,” said Guy Horne, director of sports rights at   IEC,  a media company based in Stockholm. Eventually, “there will be no distinction” between Internet and television viewing, he said.Right now, the big distinction is the money involved. The three-year old I.P.L. tournament has been a huge commercial success, generating billions of dollars from franchise fees, tickets and ad sales. Google did not disclose the terms of its deals with advertisers or with the cricket league, so it is impossible to tell whether the company made money from the broadcasts.But media buyers and sports broadcasting rights experts estimate that YouTube paid less than $10 million for the rights to live-stream the tournament for two years, and the seven advertisers in India probably paid much less than $1 million each to advertise for a year. Google is sharing  the advertising revenue with the cricket league, but did not provide details of that split.In contrast, the I.P.L. sold 10-year television rights for the series for $1.2 billion.Some observers predict the YouTube effect will be slight, at least at first.Sports leagues “will go to television to broadcast their events when they can” and resort to Internet broadcasts only  if they “can’t get a deal at all,” said Tim Westcott, a senior analyst at Screen Digest, a media research company based in London.Sports like field hockey and cycling are the most likely to gravitate to YouTube or other live online channels, he said, because they can aggregate a huge global audience by going online, even though they may not have enough fans in a local market to interest a television broadcaster.Sports leagues acknowledge that television networks still control the business for now.FIFA, the organization that runs the soccer World Cup, has sold stand-alone Internet rights in a handful of countries for this year’s tournament, but often with considerable delays so they do not conflict with television broadcasts.In China, for example, Youku.com will show all the World Cup 2010 matches and FIFA-related programming, but with 90-minute delays. China Central Television will broadcast the games live. In many countries, “broadband Internet rights are linked to the traditional TV broadcast rights,” and sold to the same entity, a FIFA representative said in an e-mailed response to questions.It would be “very unlikely” that FIFA would strike  a deal with a company like YouTube during this World Cup, the representative said. For future tournaments, though, he said, “there is perhaps a possibility.”Not everyone was happy with the cricket coverage. Comments on YouTube’s I.P.L. page were a mix of criticism of players, chest-beating team support and complaints about the quality of the online broadcast. “It is like watching a 3-D movie without the glasses,” said one commentator,  who said he was logging in from India, where broadband speeds are often slow.And the tournament has drawn some unwelcome coverage: its commissioner, Lalit Modi, was suspended in April during a government investigation into allegations of financial irregularities. Google said it has not been approached by any government body about its dealings with the I.P.L."
A Lost iPhone Shows Apple’s Churlish Side,"Journalists are already getting warmed up for the next big Apple event, the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where they will most likely get a look at the next generation of the iPhone.But there might be fewer people lined up, and not just because we got a peek inside the new model when photos of a prototype were leaked on a blog two weeks ago. We also got an unflattering peek inside the company itself.After Gizmodo, a gadget blog owned by Gawker Media, paid $5,000 to obtain a next-generation iPhone that an unfortunate Apple engineer left sitting in a Silicon Valley bar, things started to get ugly out there in gadget land.Officers from the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office kicked in a journalist’s doors and confiscated computers. Apple didn’t do the kicking, but it apparently filed a complaint — not seeking the return of their phone, which they had already retrieved, but information.According to a report from Wired, at some point people identifying themselves as representatives of Apple visited the home of the man apparently trying to peddle the phone, asking to search the premises. Home visits seem a little more up the alley of the Church of Scientology, another nongovernmental organization preoccupied by secrecy.Perhaps the law is on the side of Apple and that of the Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team, California’s high-tech crimes task force, which served the search warrant (Apple is represented on the public agency’s board).Perhaps Gizmodo was involved in the felony theft of property when it paid $5,000 and published photos and videos of the device.Perhaps Jason Chen, the Gizmodo blogger who lost four computers and two servers to the police last week, is not protected by the California shield law intended to prevent the authorities from seizing journalists’ reporting materials without a subpoena (that matter is currently under consideration so the police and county attorneys have held off combing through the computers).But those are a lot of assumptions, and regardless of how the law shakes out, the optics are horrible for Apple. Anybody with a kilobyte of common sense could have told Steve Jobs that the five minutes of pleasure that came from making a criminal complaint against journalists would be followed by much misery.Apple executives have often behaved as though the ultimate custody and control of information lies with them, and the company has gone to extraordinary lengths to protect its interests. Yet for all of its spectacular achievements, Apple is exhibiting a remarkable tone-deafness in the issue at hand. As Apple is changing into a media company, as well, its Silicon Valley brand of aggression is running up against its broader ambitions.For the iPad, Apple is eager to partner with all manner of content providers, but here the decisions seem capricious and punishing. The swimsuit girls of Sports Illustrated? There’s an app for that. But Dirty Fingers, the scantily clad girl that wipes your screen clean? Nope.A guide to gay New York and a phone directory with caricatures of public figures from a conservative filmmaker did not make the cut. And that app from the media writer and Jobs antagonist Michael Wolff? Not happening.The cartoonists’ app having a bit of fun with Tiger Woods was not approved, but the one that does a similar thing with the visage of the president of the United States? That’s O.K. And Mark Fiore’s political cartooning app got rejected and then suddenly approved after he won a Pulitzer.Notice a pattern? I haven’t either. As a consumer and admirer of Apple’s chronic innovation, it makes me queasy.The iPad, a gorgeous device for displaying content, has become something of a metaphor for the hermetic kingdom of Apple. A seamless device that can’t be opened, it has no apertures for input and is animated mostly by purchases from Apple.Then again, it will take you anywhere on the Web, unless it involves the use of Adobe’s Flash software, which Mr. Jobs has found wanting. The churlishness about Flash again goes to the issue of control, of wanting to have dominion over all aspects of the customer experience.More broadly, Apple’s behavior and choices in the Gizmodo affair threaten to interrupt the séance between the company and an adoring press, who have looked past all the frantic secrecy and reverently stared in wonder at what was eventually revealed behind the curtain.The media’s crush on Apple has always been an unrequited love affair. The company has a few familiars in the press whom it favors, but Apple has “no comment” programmed on a macro key. The company has unsuccessfully sued bloggers who,  it believed, had punctured its veil of secrecy, and important tech news organizations like Wired have been shut out as a result of coverage deemed ill-mannered.The raid on Mr. Chen can only ratchet up the tension.“When I got home, I noticed the garage door was half-open,” he said in a letter posted on Gizmodo. “And when I tried to open it, officers came out and said they had a warrant to search my house and any vehicles on the property ‘in my control.’ They then made me place my hands behind my head and searched me to make sure I had no weapons or sharp objects on me.”Apple has an admirable history of innovation and marketplace performance, but this time the company and Mr. Jobs are drawing attention for all the wrong reasons. Everyone knows that it is his show, his call. But in engaging the long arm of the law on behalf of his corporate interests, Mr. Jobs may lead us to think, um, differently about Apple’s growing cultural dominance."
"Tylenol, Generics and Trust","Is a brand-name drug synonymous with quality?That is the question many parents were asking themselves over the weekend after they learned about a wide recall of over-the-counter liquid medicines for children from a unit of Johnson & Johnson.McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the Johnson & Johnson unit, voluntarily had a  recall because some products may have manufacturing deficiencies, the Food and Drug Administration said. It did not act  because of adverse health reactions to the products, the company said in a statement.Certain liquid infants’ and children’s Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl may contain too much of the active drug ingredient or tiny metal particles or inactive ingredients that do not meet testing requirements, McNeil said. Although the potential for medical problems is remote, the company said, people should stop using the products.The recall quickly became a flashpoint for some parents on Twitter, Facebook and parenting blogs, not to mention on playgrounds and at birthday parties over the weekend. Some people said they felt frustrated in their efforts to obtain more information from the company. Others said they had lost confidence in the products. This is at least the fifth recall for consumers of McNeil products in less than a year because of quality control issues.“Another recall for baby Tylenol!” Kevin Kowalski, a father in Illinois, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “Well, then no more baby Tylenol, back to generic brand.”Johnson & Johnson is considered a model in the consumer products industry for its fast and adept handling of a Tylenol scare in 1982 in which seven people in Chicago died after taking capsules that had been laced with cyanide.  But, in that case, the problem was not the company’s fault: an outsider had tampered with the capsules. No one has ever been charged.Now, however, Johnson & Johnson and its McNeil unit may have more difficulty wooing customers back because the latest recalls stem from problems at company plants, industry analysts said. Johnson & Johnson will have to work to counter increasing consumer skepticism about whether they should pay more for name-brand children’s medicines when there are lower-cost drugstore brands available, said Michael Braun, an assistant professor of marketing at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management.“They are going to have to go to greater lengths,” Mr. Braun said. “The greater the harm to the reputation, the more expensive it is to fix it.”But some consumers said they found the company’s initial response flat-footed.Over the weekend, some people said they had been unable to obtain clear information about how to receive a refund on mcneilproductrecall.com, a company Web site about the recalled products. Other people complained that they could not get through to customer service representatives at the company’s recall hot line: (888) 222-6036. Still others complained that, when they did reach customer representatives, they were offered replacement coupons, not refunds, for the recalled products.Mark Mandel, a father of a 21-month-old daughter in Chicago, said he felt frustrated because he had thrown out a Tylenol infants’ product during a recall last year. Now, some of the replacement medicines he bought were  involved in the new recall.“It makes me question their quality control,” said Mr. Mandel, a microbiologist at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University. “It makes me wonder if they have the parents’ best interest and the children’s best interest at heart.”McNeil was working to respond to a higher than usual volume of consumer calls and had assigned additional resources to respond to customers, a company spokesman said Saturday. By Sunday, the company had posted clearer information on the site about how consumers may obtain either a refund or a coupon for recalled products.McNeil has tried to address most consumer questions in the frequently asked questions section of its recall Web site, a company spokesman said Sunday. The company understands that many consumers are either not getting through on the toll-free information line or still have questions that are not answered by the site, he said.“Responding to consumers is extremely important to us,” Marc Boston, a McNeil spokesman, wrote via e-mail. “To improve our response time to consumers, we are continuing to add to these resources including adding additional information” on the Web site and increasing staffing for the hot line.The products involved in the recall were made at a company plant in Fort Washington, Pa. McNeil is not providing information about the total number of bottles of medicine involved, Mr. Boston said. A spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration said that the recall involved more than 1,000 product lots.In instituting a wide recall, Mr. Braun speculated, McNeil may have been acting out of an abundance of caution.In January, federal health regulators cited the company for not acting quickly enough to recall a wide range of over-the-counter medicines after some consumers complained of moldy smells emanating from the products. In January,  McNeil  undertook a wide recall  of certain kinds of Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl and St. Joseph Aspirin.But after the cluster of recalls, some consumers said they had lost confidence in  brand-name over-the-counter medicines.“It’s very disturbing because you go to the store and buy the name brands thinking you are getting quality goods and then you find this out and you don’t know who to trust now,” Jennifer Perrotta, a mother of two in Massapequa, N.Y., said by phone on Sunday. “You kind of lose confidence in the brand names you have been using for years.”On Saturday, Ms. Perrotta, a speech language pathologist for the North Shore school district, told her friends via Facebook that she had emptied her medicine cabinet of children’s products. She went to her local pharmacy, she said in the interview, and bought drugstore brands to replace the name-brand medicines involved in the recall."
"Audiences, and Hollywood, Flock to Smartphones ","It might be hard to imagine watching “The Office” on a screen no bigger than a business card. But tens of thousands of people — by the most conservative estimate — are already doing just that.As Hollywood shrinks its films and television shows for the small screens of cellphones, its assumptions about mobile viewing are being upended by surprisingly patient consumers.“We all thought they’d be watching video clips in the checkout line or between classes,” said Vivi Zigler, the president for digital entertainment at  NBC Universal, summing up the industry’s conventional wisdom. But owners of iPhones and other smartphones are actually watching long episodes and sometimes complete films, so a growing number of media companies are vying for people’s mobile attention spans.Measured against TV ratings and box-office receipts, the mobile video audience is tiny today, but a range of companies, from Hollywood studios to local TV stations, all foresee an increasingly wireless world  —  and they don’t want to be cut out of the picture.Some TV shows, like “The Office” on NBC.com, are streamed at no charge now, but there is a gnawing fear among media companies that they may be leaving money on the table by relying solely on revenue from advertising. And there is always the concern — whether it be on the Internet or on phones — that the new platforms could cannibalize the companies’ core businesses.Accordingly, much of the mobile TV experimentation is happening on the paid side, through packages sold by individual carriers like AT&T and Verizon and through subscription services that will be coming soon.“The economics around this are exhausting,” Ms. Zigler said.Joining the wireless equivalent of a land rush, last month some of the biggest local TV station owners in the United States announced a joint venture to transmit their content to viewers on the go. It is most likely years away from operation.The stations would transmit to phones over the airwaves, much like Flo TV, a unit of Qualcomm, which  has invested about $1 billion in mobile video distribution. The service sends channels like ESPN, Fox News and MTV to phones.“Putting the concepts of mobility and watching video together is a natural, and we’re seeing it really grow right now,” said  Flo TV’s president, Bill Stone.Mr. Stone says the average Flo user watches 30 minutes of video a day. So far, though, few people are ponying up $10 a month or more for the service.But that is not stopping other media companies from trying to charge for walled gardens of content.  Beginning later this year, Bitbop, a product of the News Corporation’s Fox Mobile Group, will stream TV episodes to smartphones for $9.99 a month.The News Corporation declined an interview request, but Joe Bilman of Fox Mobile, who is described as the chief architect of Bitbop, said in a statement  in March that “the marriage of on-demand content and mobility has the power to ignite a fire in the smartphone space.”Along with all-you-can-watch plans like Bitbop, there are à la carte stores for mobile viewing popping up. Blockbuster, the beleaguered movie rental chain, started selling movies for phones in the last month.  The Oscar winner “The Hurt Locker” costs $3.99 for a 24-hour rental period.But no one can say how big the market is for costly  video delivered to phones. Most households already pay monthly cable or satellite TV bills.  And those distributors are already starting to circle the mobile arena.Mr. Stone would not say how many subscribers Flo has, citing relationships with its wireless carrier partners. But he acknowledged that the market was “early,” and would not say when Qualcomm expected Flo to turn profitable.On top of the paid services, there is perhaps the simplest one of all, which is free and supported by ads. When NBC.com is reached from a smartphone, it typically takes a few seconds for the episode to start playing, but the streaming is surprisingly reliable on a 3G network. Similarly, CBS gives away an iPhone application for TV viewing.Many media companies are distributing their wares several different ways, since as J. B. Perrette, the president for  digital and affiliate distribution for NBC Universal, put it, “we don’t have an answer as to which one is going to win out.”From services like Flo, networks receive subscriber fees. From their own Web sites, networks may find it easier to customize ads to individual viewers.While the audience for mobile TV is small at the moment, it is growing rapidly. Roughly 17.6 million people in the United States watched video on their phones in the fourth quarter of last year, according to the Nielsen Company, up from 11.2 million 12 months earlier. They watched an average of three hours and 37 minutes of mobile video a month.By way of comparison, Americans who watch television watch on average 153 hours of traditional TV  a month.Eric Berger, the senior vice president for digital networks for Sony Pictures Television, said the increase in mobile-viewing minutes  correlates  to the surge in smartphone sales. Sony has found that mobile visitors to its online video site, Crackle, watch movies for an average of 26 minutes. About 20 percent of visitors finish the movies. Mr. Berger said he thinks that people tune in to movies that they have already seen and watch portions of them again.Many media researchers still maintain  that viewers gravitate toward the best available screen, defending TV as the medium to beat. If a parent is watching on the living room TV set, a child may choose to watch something else on his or her phone.“It’s becoming more mass market than it was, say, two years ago,” Mr. Berger said of mobile TV.Similarly, Ms. Zigler has found that 60 percent of mobile visitors to NBC.com are coming from home, indicating that some people do not mind watching  comedies and dramas on a palm-size screen even when a big-screen TV is nearby. “It’s pretty remarkable,” she said.But bandwidth constraints are a big concern. Blockbuster’s streaming service, for instance, does not yet work on the iPhone, which is sold by Apple, with service by AT&T.The iPhone is “a little challenging,” said Scott Levine, vice president for digital at Blockbuster, citing the heavy bandwidth demands the phone places on AT&T’s strained network. “We have to think about how to make 3G work with the carriers. Above all, we want it to be a good experience for users.”Carriers say they are gradually introducing next-generation networks that will be better suited for widespread video viewing. And Kay Johansson, the chief technology officer for MobiTV, said his company and others kept finding ways to squeeze more data through the existing lines.But in the meantime, ventures that rely on over-the-air spectrum  —  like Flo and, someday, the one announced by local stations  —  say they can deliver video to mobile customers much more efficiently. Both factions are confident that people will increasingly want to watch video on the go, whether  live over the airwaves or on demand over a wireless carrier’s network.“The TV at home is just going to be a bigger screen,” Mr. Johansson said."
United and Continental Said to Agree to Merge,"United Airlines and Continental Airlines agreed Sunday to a $3 billion merger that would create the world’s biggest airline, according to people briefed on the negotiations.The deal, to be announced officially on Monday, would form a coast-to-coast behemoth with a leading presence in the top domestic markets, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, along with an extended network to Asia, Latin America and Europe. The deal was completed in a remarkably swift three weeks, and would give the airlines the muscle to fend off low-cost rivals at home and to take on foreign carriers abroad.United is buying Continental, and the combined company will  keep the United name and be based in Chicago. Jeffery A. Smisek, Continental’s chief executive, would run the company. If the deal wins antitrust approval, the merged airline would replace Delta Air Lines as the top carrier.The boards of both companies met Sunday to approve the all-stock deal, according to people familiar with the companies who spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were delicate. The UAL Corporation, United’s parent company, would issue 1.05 shares for each Continental share, valuing the acquisition at $3.17 billion, based on Friday’s closing price. The merger is expected to be completed before the end of the year.For consumers, the merger could eventually result in higher prices. Though the new company does not intend to raise fares, according to the people briefed on the matter, one of the rationales for airline mergers is to cut capacity. That reduces the number of seats in the industry and allows airlines to increase fares.In addition, United and Continental will no longer be competing against each other on some routes, allowing them to save money but offering travelers fewer options.“Airlines are struggling to find a business model that makes sense,” said Scott Sonenshein, an assistant professor at the Jones Graduate School of Business at Rice University. “Consolidation gives them more leverage. As a consumer, you will have less choices, fewer routes, higher prices and more fees.”Still, in the last decade fares have declined because of pressure from low-fare airlines like Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways, as well as lower passenger demand. As a result, previous mergers have had a muted effect on ticket prices, especially on routes served by low-fare carriers.Even with the steep cuts  made in the last two years, airlines are still losing money, with too many seats chasing too few passengers. For much of the last decade they have suffered a succession of powerful blows — from the terrorist attacks of 9/11  to rapidly rising fuel costs and the recession. They have also been straining to keep up with low-fare competition.But  with the economy starting to improve and passenger traffic picking up, the industry is generally healthier now, with more cash and less debt. Credit markets have also thawed, allowing access to capital.Combined, United and Continental have 21 percent of domestic capacity, in terms of so-called available seat miles, or one seat flown one mile. Delta has a market share of 20 percent. Globally, the merged companies would  have a 7 percent market share.The merger would put pressure on American Airlines, which was once the market leader, but which would drop to third place. While American’s executives say they do not feel threatened by industry mergers, Wall Street analysts have been displeased by the company’s performance.US Airways, which three weeks ago began its own merger talks with United, is now left on the sidelines, raising questions about its ability to survive as a stand-alone carrier.The United-Continental deal has some major hurdles to clear. The airlines need to win approval from the Justice Department’s antitrust division, a challenge given the renewed regulatory zeal in Washington. Unlike the Bush administration’s six-month review of the Delta-Northwest deal, analysts expect a lengthier and more complex review of this merger.The merger also needs the backing of employee unions, whose opposition to mergers in the past has undone many of the proposed savings. One factor in favor of the deal is that United’s pilots’ union indicated last month it would not oppose a deal with Continental, whose own pilots have so far remained silent.The board approvals end nearly a month of intrigue after United initiated talks to combine with US Airways. Those negotiations caught Continental executives by surprise, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Many analysts said United’s talks with US Airways were intended all along to lure Continental to the table.United and Continental were close to a merger two years ago, but Continental walked away because of United’s poor financial health.The earlier talks allowed for swift negotiations this time. United and Continental executives quickly settled some potentially divisive issues, like the name of the combined company, where its headquarters would be and who would run it. United’s chairman, Glenn F. Tilton, would remain for two years. After that, Mr. Smisek of Continental would become the executive chairman.The Chicago connection could provide additional benefits. Mr. Tilton has been courting local politicians, and the city is eager to retain a major business. United now could use that leverage with the Obama administration, whose ties to Chicago run deep.United shareholders would own 55 percent of the combined company, with Continental shareholders owning the rest. Management would be roughly split between the sides. The new entity would expect annual cost savings of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, and would still fly to 370 cities in 59 countries.The combined airlines would have a 40 percent market share at San Francisco International  and 35 percent at Chicago O’Hare International, according to data compiled by Cambridge Aviation Research, a consulting company. At Houston Intercontinental, one of the city’s two airports, they would have 64 percent of the market and at Newark Liberty International, 55 percent.A merger could yield more than $2 billion in additional revenue and cost savings, according to estimates by Vicki Bryan, an analyst at Gimme Credit.The deal is a personal success for Mr. Tilton, a former oil executive who ran the Texaco Corporation until it was acquired by Chevron. He took over United in 2002 as it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and has since pushed relentlessly for a merger.It also vindicates the work of Kathryn A. Mikells, United’s chief financial officer since November 2008, who is the highest-ranking woman in an industry dominated by men. Analysts have praised her for United’s cost-cutting efforts in the last year, Jeff Straebler, a strategist at RBS Securities, said.United’s improved finances have allowed for a major turnaround in its fortunes. In 2008, it was Continental that was close to buying United. But as that deal was being negotiated, United reported steeper-than-expected losses, leading to doubts about the company’s health even as soaring oil prices were crippling the entire industry. Just hours before a deal was to be announced, Continental executives walked away.But in the last two years, United has improved its cash position, aggressively reduced capacity,  raised new revenue from bag and other fees, and cut costs. It now has $4.5 billion in cash."
"Greece Takes Its Bailout, but Doubts for the Region Persist","ATHENS —  Greece announced on Sunday that it had reached agreement on a long-delayed financial rescue package that would  require years of painful belt-tightening, but the deal might  not be enough to stop the spread of economic contagion to other European countries with mounting debts and troubled economies.The bailout, which was worked out over weeks of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and Greece’s European partners, calls for 110 billion euros, or $146 billion, in loans over the next three years intended to avoid a debt default.But analysts warned that Greece had not yet solved its fundamental problems and that other sovereign debt crises could arise as lenders and market speculators turned their attention to a handful of similarly vulnerable nations across southern Europe.“The immediate impact may be soothing, but the inflammation will soon show up again,” said Edward Hugh, an economist in Barcelona who writes for the influential Fistful of Euros blog. “My feeling is the rot has now gone too far.”In Greece, Prime Minister George Papandreou, the scion of a Socialist dynasty whose father helped erect the sprawling Greek welfare state when he was prime minister in the 1980s, sought to prepare Greeks for what was expected to be the greatest overhaul of the state in a generation.“I want to tell Greeks very honestly,” he said, “that we have a big trial ahead of us.”“I have done and will do everything not to let the country go bankrupt,” Mr. Papandreou said in a televised address that urged Greeks to accept “great sacrifices” to avoid “catastrophe.”While the bailout provides a lifeline to the Greek government, similar challenges await other deficit-racked countries like Portugal, Spain and perhaps even Italy. Moreover, nations like Latvia, Hungary and Romania  — which are outside the 16-member group that uses the euro as its common currency — are all struggling in their own efforts to meet economic and fiscal goals set in conjunction with the I.M.F.A big test of the rescue plan’s effectiveness will come this week when global markets render a verdict. Until now, efforts  to assist Greece have been seen as too little, too late  —  prompting the upward spiral in interest rates that finally forced Europe and the I.M.F. to act decisively.The fact that  the rescue plan has been expected for the better part of a week, and does not address challenges in Portugal  and Spain, may well be seen by investors as a sign that the broader issue of Europe’s debt problem remains unresolved.Poul Thomsen, I.M.F. mission chief for Greece, said the austerity measures should help reassure markets. “I think this is a defining moment for Greece; I think it will restore confidence,” he said. “I think you will see a sustained, significant decline of spreads.” He added that the package for Greece was in no way a blueprint for other countries.For Europe, the agreement was an important step toward preserving the credibility of its single currency. It  followed weeks of negotiations that created some of the deepest fissures in the move toward European integration that began more than half a century ago. European leaders have bristled at criticism that their halting response to the crisis made things worse and insisted on stringent conditions for the required bailout.“I think that result is fully in line with what we very much wanted,” Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, told a news conference in Brussels on Sunday.He added, though, that “democracies have their own particular timetables,” an apparent allusion to the national interests that critics say prevented a quick and coordinated response.The strongest national interests are in Germany, where there is stiff public resistance to a bailout of Greece. The German parliament must still approve the aid package before the loans can start. Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday that she would present draft legislation to her cabinet on Monday and hoped to have the approval of the German contribution through the parliament by Friday.“I’m going to get behind such a path by all means,” she told reporters in Bonn. She said the program was essential to safeguard the stability of the euro.For Greece, the rescue package, which is expected to be approved by the Socialist-controlled legislature later this week, will require years of sacrifice.The finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, said Greece had agreed to raise its value-added tax to 23 percent from 21 percent, to freeze civil servants’ wages and to eliminate public sector annual bonuses amounting to two months’ pay. In addition, members of parliament would no longer receive bonuses.He said special rules allowing for early retirement of civil servants would be tightened and the government intended to increase taxes on fuel, tobacco and alcohol by about 10 percent.But Mr. Papandreou said that in tough negotiations with the I.M.F., the European Union and the European Central Bank, the government had succeeded in avoiding cuts to private sector salaries.Crucially, Mr. Papaconstantinou did not address the critical issue of whether the government would relax rules on laying off public sector workers, whose generous salaries and benefits have been a central cause of Greece’s debt problem.Indicating that the measures would inevitably undermine economic growth, Mr. Papaconstantinou forecast a deeper than expected recession of 4 percent for 2010, with a further fall of 2.6 percent in 2011, before the economy returned to growth of 1.1 percent in 2012.And he conceded that the program, even if successful, would  take longer than originally hoped to restore Greece’s fiscal balance.“We will be in recession for the next few years, which means that we have to run faster to reduce the deficit,” he said.Vassilis Papadimitriou, a spokesman for the Greek prime minister’s office, said President Obama had spoken by phone with Mr. Papandreou and had offered his support for the measures taken by the Greek government, calling them “brave.”The bailout begins with 45 billion euros this year, followed by more aid in the next two years.In return, Greece has promised to make budget cuts of 30 billion euros, or $40 billion, over the next three years. Mr. Papaconstantinou said the financing from the rescue plan covered a large part of Greek borrowing needs for the next three years.European Union and I.M.F. officials said the bailout plan also included a support fund for domestic banks, which may face an increase in bad loans as the recession deepens.Mr. Thomsen of the I.M.F. dismissed any suggestions that Greece needed to restructure its debt and require lenders to take a big hit as well. “It has never been discussed, no plans, nothing,” he said.But some economists argued that debt restructuring should not be ruled out as an option for the future. It would reduce the overall debt burden on Greece’s economy, but would also create the heavy risk of pushing spooked investors to deny Greece access to credit markets.For all the effort that has been put into creating the rescue package, doubts remained whether Greece would be able to follow through on what amounts to a cultural revolution in the social contract between state and citizen.In a sign of the challenges ahead, Greece’s largest public sector workers union, ADEDY, said on Sunday night that the harshness of the cuts had prompted it to extend a 24-hour strike previously scheduled for Wednesday to two days beginning on Tuesday.Mr. Papandreou has thus far largely escaped blame for a crisis that has been pinned on the profligacy of his predecessors from the center right.But Yannos Papantoniou, a former finance minister from the ruling Socialist party, said that while Greeks understood the need for sacrifice after years of excessive borrowing, their patience was limited and they would expect to see positive results soon.Yiannis Stournaras, a leading economist and former economic adviser to the ruling Socialist party, argued that the close monitoring by the I.M.F. and the European Union would prevent the Greek government from deviating from the austerity path.“The I.M.F. will be here every few months and will be keeping a close eye on Greece’s every move,” he said. He jokingly conceded that such skepticism was inevitable.“People haven’t trusted the Greeks since the time of the Trojan war,” he said. “So this is nothing new.”"
"In a State’s Search for Sales Tax, Amazon Raises Privacy Concerns","NORTH CAROLINA last month began an audit of online businesses, assuming that millions of dollars in sales taxes owed to the state had disappeared into the Internet.“This is really an issue of fairness and equity for small businesses, the brick and mortar, corner store operations,” said Kenneth R. Lay, the state’s secretary of revenue. “These businesses are at a competitive disadvantage when they have to collect sales taxes that other businesses do not.”The response of one of those online businesses, Amazon.com, was succinct: back off.In a complaint filed in Federal District Court in Seattle, the company said that the audit violated the First Amendment and privacy rights of the customers, as well as the company itself.The case offers a glimpse at the changed landscape of  privacy in the United States. Under the old model, the law was meant to protect the public from a snooping government. And the government was generally the only entity with the resources to snoop on people in a systematic way.Today, the online snooping (make that “data collection”) never stops. Can the old tools really prevent the government from closely monitoring its people when so much information is a mere Internet search away? And is the government the one we really need protection from?Amazon’s lawyers say the Constitution protects the company so that it “may sell  —  and customers may read, hear or view  —  a broad range of popular and unpopular expressive materials with the customers’ private content choices protected from unnecessary government scrutiny.”The complaint gave examples of books Amazon had shipped to North Carolina: “Bipolar Disorder: A Guide for Patients and Families,” by Francis Mark Mondimore, and “He Had It Coming: How to Outsmart Your Husband and Win Your Divorce,” by Stacy Schneider. The movies, the complaint said, included “Lolita,” “Brokeback Mountain” and “Fahrenheit 9/11.”It is a telling list: imagine what the government could do with “Converting to Islam for Dummies” or “Plant Your Own Marijuana Field.” For this reason, privacy experts say, library records have been granted special protections and are generally not kept for long, lest they offer a tempting target for investigators.One thing, though. There happens to be an organization that does have a good idea of who is reading what  —  Amazon. For many isolated people, Amazon is the closest thing to a library. The closest thing, perhaps, until Google enters the e-book business, and knows what books you have bought and even what pages you’ve read online.In an interview, Mr. Lay said North Carolina never wanted to know the titles of books or movies that were sold. “It is important to know whether a book or steak was sold, but we don’t care about the title of the book or the type of steak,” he said, adding that the tax rates are different in each case. “We have too much data. The last thing we need is data we don’t need.”The dispute over whether Amazon will have to reveal the names of its customers, without the titles, is still in court. “To comply with their demand will reveal the personal preferences of North Carolina consumers,” Amazon said in a statement.The lawsuit can seem like the front line of the battle for privacy in the Internet age, with Amazon on the barricades holding back an overreaching government. After all, the company does not share its purchasing lists with anyone. And as Amazon argued in federal court, its business would be hurt if it ever did, whether in aid of tax collection or as a business proposition.“Customers who fear that their purchases will not be private are less likely to purchase books, movies, music or other items that might be personal, sensitive or controversial,” the company argued.What remains is a sobering combination  —  on  one hand, there is the detailed information held by companies like Amazon and  Google, which have a strong business incentive to fight off the government. Yet even as they go to court to protect the information they have collected, that information still represents a “honey pot for the government,” Cindy Cohn, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says.In cases where the government gains a court’s approval, it would have access to a trove of material that 10 years ago would be unthinkable in its detail.“That’s why we are trying to convince all people who store data not to do it,” she said. “We need to strengthen the law that when we collect information for one purpose, it isn’t used for another.”In addition, there is all the material that roams freely available on the Internet, particularly on social networks like Facebook, which are convinced that more sharing is what their users want.This information can find its way to the government without need of a warrant, Joel R. Reidenberg, a professor of law at Fordham University, says. And while each piece of data can seem innocuous, when collected and weaved into a personal profile, it can be quite revealing.“If a private company has information, they can sell it,” including to the government, he said. “You need a warrant when there is a reasonable expectation of privacy,” he added, but if a private company has the information, on what basis would someone expect it to be private from the government?“The bleed from privately held data to state surveillance can happen very quickly,” he said."
Big Paydays for the Chiefs in the Media,"The media industry may be going through some rough times, with the landscape changing day to day, but at least one aspect is business as usual: big paydays for the people at the top.Top executives at the country’s largest media companies continued to reel in multimillion-dollar pay packages in 2009, a year of widespread cost-cutting throughout the industry. In several cases, the packages even increased from the year before.At the top of the list is Leslie Moonves, chief executive of the CBS Corporation, whose pay package in 2009 totaled almost $43 million, more than twice what he made in 2008, according to an analysis by Equilar, an executive compensation research firm.Not far behind was Viacom’s chief executive, Philippe P. Dauman, who was paid nearly $34 million, a 22 percent increase over 2008. Sumner M. Redstone, who controls CBS and Viacom, was paid more than $33 million from the two companies combined.“Anybody who reads the business section knows the margins are being squeezed at media companies, so the fact that there are these huge packages makes no sense,” said James F. Reda, the founder of James F. Reda & Associates, a compensation consulting firm with offices in New York and Atlanta.At Comcast, the two highest-paid executives, Brian L. Roberts and Stephen B. Burke, were paid $25 million and $31 million. Mr. Roberts’s pay was essentially the same as the year before, while Mr. Burke’s increased about $12 million, much of it because of one-time bonuses related to the company’s purchase of NBC Universal.For several executives, it was more lucrative to be running a media company in 2009, however wobbly it might be, than a large financial firm, where many boards cut executive pay after the federal financial bailout.John G. Stumpf, the head of Wells Fargo, was the highest-paid financial executive, earning an $18.8 million package, according to an analysis by Equilar. Lloyd C. Blankfein, the head of Goldman Sachs, made $41 million in 2008 and less than $1 million in 2009, Equilar said, not including a $9 million payout he received  this year that was deemed to be for work done the year before but is not included in Equilar’s calculations.The bankers’ pay will most likely return to past levels if financial reform passes, Mr. Reda said, as Washington’s spotlight will shift elsewhere and the banks will have less incentive to stay in the public’s good graces.Mr. Reda said, “What is the government going to do after financial reform? Take away their birthday?”Despite the hard times at many media companies and the uncertainty of maintaining revenue in the digital future, investors did not  shy away last year. The stock of CBS jumped 74 percent in 2009, and Viacom’s stock rose 56 percent.In the case of many of the media executives, including Mr. Dauman at Viacom, most  of the compensation is based on the company’s performance. Mr. Dauman’s base salary in 2009, $2.5 million, was unchanged from the year before.The media industry did rebound in 2009 after a particularly tough 2008, but for many companies that largely meant cutting expenses, including labor costs. Overall revenue declines remained commonplace, but in many cases profits rose.At Viacom, revenue in 2009 declined 7 percent compared with the year before but the company’s profit rose to $1.6 billion, a 29 percent increase, not far off from Mr. Dauman’s 22 percent pay raise. CBS returned to profitability in 2009 — $227 million — after a huge write-down in 2008.“Right now, the executive compensation is not what’s driving people to invest or not invest in these stocks,” said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG in New York. “Shareholders are more focused on the underlying growth prospects of the companies than executive compensation.”The pay packages for executives at public companies are  made available in corporate filings. Equilar’s calculation includes base salary, discretionary and performance-based cash bonuses, the grant-date value of stock and option awards and other compensation.Pay increases extended beyond the handful of large media conglomerates to some of the largest newspaper companies as well.Craig A. Dubow, the head of Gannett, the country’s largest newspaper publisher, was paid $4.4 million in 2009, up 17 percent from the year before.At The New York Times, Janet L. Robinson, the chief executive, was paid $4.9 million in 2009, 26 percent more than the year before, and Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the chairman, made $4.8 million, a 171 percent increase. Gary B. Pruitt, the chief executive of McClatchy, was paid $2.6 million last year, up 61 percent.But  pay did not increase across the board.Both Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes at the News Corporation had declines in  pay, 40 percent for Mr. Murdoch — to about $18 million — and 21 percent for Mr. Ailes, the head of Fox News, who was paid $14.6 million.Other top executives’ pay fell, too. Robert A. Iger, head of Disney, was paid $21.6 million in 2009, 58 percent less than the year before, and his counterpart at Time Warner, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, earned $19.4 million, a 10 percent drop.Several analysts said the shifting marketplace and uncertainty surrounding the media business could actually contribute to the large payouts, making companies even more determined to hold on to people they see as gifted executives.“When you have an industry going through so much tumult, it puts upward pressure on pay because so many people are moving around,” said Don Delves, the president of the Delves Group, a compensation consulting firm in Chicago. “People are looking around a lot, people are moving around and there’s a concern about losing talent.”He added that big compensation figures were “one of the difficulties in the whole business model.”"
Washington Times in Talks for Sale or Partnership,"The months-long upheaval at The Washington Times is continuing,  as the owners of the conservative newspaper have put it up for sale.The struggling paper is owned by News World Communications, a wing of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon’s Unification Church. For years the church has helped subsidize the paper, but those funds have been cut as  control of the paper has changed hands within Mr. Moon’s family.Nicholas Chiaia, one of  the paper’s two-member board, said in a statement on Thursday  that the company had “recently entered into discussions with a number of parties interested in either purchasing or partnering with The Washington Times.” The discussions, he said, are “part of a strategic effort to ensure that the newspaper remains sustainable.”The sale was first reported by The Washington Post, which also reported that John Solomon, who resigned as the paper’s executive editor late last year, is one of several potential buyers. Mr. Solomon worked as a reporter for The Post before taking the editor’s job in 2008.The announcement continued a whirlwind of developments at the paper. On April 25, Jonathan Slevin, the paper’s publisher, announced that the company would not be extending his six-month contract, which ended on Friday.In a letter to the staff, Mr. Slevin wrote that “it has been exceedingly difficult for me and my leadership team to work with The Washington Times board of directors,” who, he said, had no experience in the newspaper business but were taking an “active and intrusive role.”He added that that the directors were “either aloof or out of touch with our endeavors, which made things even more difficult.”Richard Wojcik is the  other member of the  board, besides  Mr. Chiaia.Much of the turmoil at the paper began last year, when Mr. Moon, now 90, turned control of his empire over to a daughter and three sons. Infighting followed, and the Rev. Hyung Jin Moon, the youngest son, took over as the church’s religious leader, and his eldest son, Hyun Jin Moon, became chairman of News World Communications.As control of the company changed hands, the large subsidy from the church ebbed and the paper responded by cutting  its staff by more than half and eliminating some sections.The Times, published since 1982, has long billed itself as a scrappy ideological counterweight to The Post, Washington’s dominant paper. The Times  has acted as a launching pad for many young conservative journalists, including Tony Blankley and the late  Tony Snow. While it no longer submits its circulation figures to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, it is widely believed to sell far fewer than 100,000 copies each weekday."
Maker of Pregnancy Test Finds Opportunity in Personal Stories,"IN a new Web-only reality series on TLC.com, “A Conception Story,” Mary, 34, sits in the living room of her home in Virginia  and explains why she and Mike, her husband of 10 years, put off having children.“I’ve never been under the illusion that raising kids would be easy,” she says. “So that’s why I decided to wait until I was ready — until I was ready emotionally to give up everything — because that’s what you really need to do.”But when Mary (last names are not disclosed in the series) decided to have a child three years ago, she was unable to conceive, and the couple had no success at a fertility clinic.“If you really want something in your life, you make room for it,” Mary says, her eyes welling with tears. “There’s a room upstairs that I haven’t done anything with, and I won’t paint it. I won’t do anything because it’s the baby’s room, and until I know if it’s going to be a girl or boy, I’m just leaving that space.”The series, which was introduced on the Web site on April 26 and  is following Mary and five other women as they try to conceive over the next seven months, is a natural for TLC, whose series about newborns, “A Baby Story,” is in its 12th season.“A Conception Story” is decidedly different in that the idea came not from producers at the network but rather from First Response, a brand by  Church & Dwight that makes pregnancy, ovulation and fertility test kits.According Stacey Feldman, vice president for marketing at First Response, the brand first approached the Web site about six months ago and, when the series was approved, set guidelines for casting the show to reflect the breadth of First Response’s  intended customers.The six participants, who also will contribute to a blog on the site, have been provided with digital video cameras. They will document their progress and send footage to TLC, which will edit the videos and upload them to the Web site within a couple days.This means the series will unfold practically in real time. First Response has provided participants with its line of testing kits and pregnancy tests that will probably underpin decisive moments, much as scales do in the weight-loss show “The Biggest Loser.”Pregnancy-related test kits represent “the most emotionally charged category you’ll ever see,” Ms. Feldman said. “We have a goal of empowering women, and with this Web series we’re not just products, we’re a tested guide. We’re holding these women’s hands.”A fertility specialist who acts as a spokesman for the brand, Dr. Peter Ahlering, also appears in informational videos on the site.Harold Morgenstern, senior vice president for  advertising sales at Discovery Communications, TLC.com’s parent company, said this was its first reality show initiated by an advertiser.“The reason we were open to this is First Response has been a very trusted brand for more than 25 years,” Mr. Morgenstern said. “And we think this is compelling content.”As for casting, “we were not looking for the friction or the wows that come up in the ‘Jersey Shore’ type show,” Mr. Morgenstern said. “We are positive that these women will be able to relate to our viewers online.”The average age for first-time mothers climbed from 21.4 years old in 1970 to 25 in 2006, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Before the economic downturn, that meant steady growth for home pregnancy and ovulation tests, since women monitor themselves more closely when racing against the biological clock.But “a higher incidence of postponing pregnancy in a poor economy has put a damper on home pregnancy test sales,” according to a  report in February  by Mintel, a market research firm, which reported that sales of pregnancy tests dropped 2.5 percent in 2008 and  3.4 percent in 2009.Sales for pregnancy test kits totaled $227 million for the 52 weeks that ended March 21, a drop of 3.8 percent from the previous 52 weeks, according to SymphonyIRI Group, a market research firm whose data does not include Wal-Mart.First Response commands a 25.8 percent share of the category, while a less expensive Church & Dwight brand, Answer, has an additional  6.9 percent. E.P.T., a Johnson & Johnson brand, has a 19.3 percent share. The ovulation test market is considerably smaller, totaling $32.8 million in the last 52 weeks, a drop of 10 percent from the previous year.First Response spent $18 million on advertising in 2009, down from $24 million in 2008, according to Kantar Media, a unit of WPP that tracks ad spending; it will spend more than $25 million in advertising this year, according to Ms. Feldman.One segment less likely to be interested in the new online series is women who test to confirm they are not pregnant, whom  Ms. Feldman calls “hopeful negatives.” (While its ovulation and fertility kits both include images of infants on packages, pregnancy kits do not.)Ms. Feldman said that while their customers are evenly split among those wanting a positive and negative result, “hopeful positives buy more boxes and use more sticks,” and account for about 60 percent of unit sales.Mintel, meanwhile, says that at least one part of the home diagnostics market may be an economic bellwether. As the economy begins to recover, ovulation tests will be a “potential bright spot,” Mintel added, because women will have delayed trying to conceive much longer and “may turn to ovulation tests to help them become pregnant.”"
"Senate Financial Bill Misguided, Some Academics Say","As Democrats close in on their goal of overhauling the nation’s financial regulations, several prominent experts say that the legislation does not even address the right problems, leaving the financial system vulnerable to another major crisis.Some point to specific issues left largely untouched, like the instability of capital markets that provide money for lenders, or the government’s role in the housing market, including the future of the housing finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Others simply argue that it is premature to pass sweeping legislation while so much about the crisis remains unclear and so many inquiries are in progress.“Until we understand what the causes were, we may be implementing ineffective and even counterproductive reforms,” said Andrew W. Lo, a finance professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “I understand the need for action. I understand the need for something to be done. But what I expect from political leaders is for them to demonstrate leadership in telling the public that we need to proceed about this in a much more deliberate and rational and thoughtful way.”Senate Republicans echoed some of these concerns as they delayed debate on the legislation last week. Democrats agree that significant issues remain to be addressed. But they say that the government must press forward in responding to the problems that already are clear.The bill, which was introduced by Christopher J. Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee,  would extend oversight to a wider range of financial institutions and activities. It would create a new agency to protect borrowers from abuse by lenders, including mortgage and credit card companies. And it seeks to ensure that troubled companies, however large, can be liquidated at no cost to taxpayers.A diverse group of critics, however, say the legislation focuses on the precipitators of the recent crisis, like abusive mortgage lending, rather than the mechanisms by which the crisis spread.Gary B. Gorton, a finance professor at Yale, said the financial system would remain vulnerable to panics because the legislation would not improve the reliability of the markets where lenders get money, by issuing short-term debt called commercial paper or loans called repurchase agreements or “repos.”The recent crisis began as investors nervous about mounting subprime mortgage losses started demanding higher returns, then withholding money altogether. The government is now moving to prevent abusive mortgage lending, but Mr. Gorton said investors could just as easily be spooked by something else.The flight of investors is the modern version of a bank run, in which depositors line up to withdraw their money. The banking industry was plagued by runs until the government introduced deposit insurance during the Great Depression. Professor Gorton said the industry had now entered a new era of instability.“It is unfortunate if we end up repeating history,” Professor Gorton said. “It’s basically tragic that we can’t understand the importance of this issue.”Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner agreed in April testimony before the House Financial Services Committee that “more work remains to be done in this area,” but he said that regulators could address the issue without legislation. The government plans to require lenders to hold larger reserves against unexpected losses  and to require that they keep money on hand to meet short-term needs.David A. Skeel Jr., a corporate law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said it would be a mistake for Congress to leave the drafting of these standards to the discretion of regulators.“Regulators working right now will be tough,” Professor Skeel said. “But we know from history that as soon as this legislative moment passes, the ball is going to shift back into Wall Street’s court. As soon as the crisis passes, what inevitably happens is that the people that are paying the most attention are the banks.”A second group of critics say the government helped to seed the crisis through its efforts to increase home ownership, including the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in buying mortgage loans to make more money available for lending. The companies are now owned by the government after incurring enormous losses on loans that borrowers could not afford to repay.Lawrence J. White, a finance professor at New York University, said it made no sense to overhaul financial regulation without addressing the future of federal housing policy. He said he was trying to find the strongest possible words to describe the omission of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from the legislation.“It’s outrageous,” he finally said.Republicans have repeatedly criticized the administration for advancing legislation that does not address the companies’ future. The Obama administration says drafting a new housing policy is on its agenda for next year.Other critics warn that the proposed legislation would insert the government deeply into the financial markets, creating new distortions and seeding future crises. They say the focus of financial reform should instead be on increased transparency.Andrew Redleaf and Richard Vigilante, hedge fund managers who started warning investors in 2006 that a housing crisis was inevitable, proposed a minimalist version of reform in their recent book “Panic.” They want to require all financial institutions, including investment banks and hedge funds like their own, to disclose, at least once a week, every position in tradable securities.“The Dodd bill is almost entirely irrelevant,” Mr. Vigilante said in a telephone interview. “All it does is strengthen what we’ve had for years,” a system that depends on judgments made by regulators behind closed doors.Proponents of the legislation say that it significantly expands transparency, for example by requiring many derivatives contracts to trade in public view. But they say that the government also needs to expand the scope of its oversight because the worst excesses that led to the crisis began and flourished at nonbank financial institutions that were not subject to federal regulation.The most basic critique comes from Professor Lo and others who say that Congress is moving too quickly. The origins of the crisis remain a subject of intense controversy. Investigations continue to unearth surprising information. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a bipartisan panel created by Congress, is not scheduled to report until December. Why not wait, they ask, until the targets are clearer?Phil Angelides, the chairman of the inquiry commission and a Democrat, says that the problems raised by the crisis will not be solved in one stroke and that he supports the Democratic push to begin the process soon.But the critics point to the words of Nicholas F. Brady, a former Treasury secretary who led the bipartisan investigation into the 1987 stock market crash: “You can’t fix what you can’t explain.”"
Oliver Stone Takes His Film on Tour in South America,"“Hope to see you in Cochabamba!” a notably chipper Oliver Stone said at the end of a phone conversation last week. Mr. Stone will be in Cochabamba, in central Bolivia, on June 1 to screen his documentary “South of the Border” for an outdoor crowd that is expected to include thousands of indigenous people being gathered by Bolivia’s president, Evo Morales.The screening is part of a South American road trip intended to find what most documentaries lack: an audience.Last September, Venezuela’s president, Hugo Chávez, showed up at the Venice Film Festival in support of the film, which explores social transformation under Mr. Chávez and his influence elsewhere in South America. Mr. Chávez and Mr. Morales, who is also featured in the film, were later on hand, along with Susan Sarandon and Courtney Love, for a screening at Lincoln Center in New York.Now, Mr. Stone is planning to introduce the movie in a series of South American countries, including at least four in which “South of the Border” is set to receive presidential attention.On May 28, the movie will have a Caracas premiere, with Mr. Chávez, who is apparently quite a fan, on hand. On May 30  Mr. Stone will be  in Ecuador with President Rafael Correa; on June 2 in Paraguay, with President Fernando Lugo.“If Lula is around, he’ll show up,” Mr. Stone predicted. That would be the president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who might attend a May 31 premiere in São Paulo.In all, “South of the Border” is set for release in three dozen countries, including the United States, where Cinema Libre Studios expects to open the film in New York on June 25, and elsewhere later.Promotional plans for “South of the Border” have firmed up while Mr. Stone finishes “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,” to be released in September by 20th Century Fox.In filming Mr. Chávez, Mr. Stone said, the idea was “to get face time, which we don’t get here without the filters.” MICHAEL CIEPLY "
Time Warner Cable Puts a New Name on News Stations,"In Albany, Syracuse, Rochester and other  areas  of upstate New York, Time Warner Cable’s disparate local news channels all have a new name: Your News Now.In the past year, the company  quietly introduced the new name for the channels, reflecting the fact that they are increasingly sharing segments and production staff members. NY1,  in New York City, is the company’s only channel in the state not affected by the name change.Time Warner Cable is now taking the name beyond New York, too, first by rebranding News 8 Austin in Texas.“Even though we had built a brand with our existing stations, we decided we could be more efficient,” said Steve Paulus, who oversees Time Warner Cable’s local news division.A consistent name lets the company save money on graphics and marketing. It encourages more statewide advertising sales. And it fosters more sharing of news coverage. “When they say, ‘I’m John Smith for Your News Now,’ that can play anywhere,” Mr. Paulus said.NY1 is exempt because, Mr. Paulus said, it is a 20-year-old widely recognizable name.Some staff members in the local newsrooms were reluctant to give up the brand names they had helped build for years. But Mr. Paulus said “there wasn’t even a blip” of bad reaction when Rochester’s channel, formerly called R News, became the first channel to convert last year.The channels may run on a shoestring, but they are  important in  Time Warner Cable. As the primary cable provider in most of the state of New York, its  local news channels are a retention tool for cable subscribers; the channels  are not available from competing services like Verizon FiOS. “It’s a hedge against competition,” Mr. Paulus said.NY1 is profitable, and the other channels “are getting there,” Mr. Paulus said.The company continues to add local channels, in Buffalo last year and in the Hudson Valley last month. For the Hudson Valley channel, about 10 employees work in the field while a dozen anchors, producers and technical staff work out of a regional base in Albany.Time Warner Cable is looking to add local channels elsewhere, and Mr. Paulus said the Your News Now brand will “make it that much easier.” According to two people with knowledge of the plans, it is considering expanding into California;  the company would not confirm this.Next on his to-do list: a possible Washington bureau for all the channels.

NBC Opens Its Wallet to Build Up Prime Time,"LOS ANGELES — For Jeff Gaspin, handed the task of pulling NBC’s prime-time schedule out of a long, precipitous slide, the first priority is reality — as a concept, not a program genre.“This is the first year in quite some time that we’re being realistic,” he said in a lunch interview here. “We’re being realistic about how much we need to spend. We’re being realistic about what our margin should be, or what our amount of loss should be. We’re being realistic about what it actually takes.”As in: money. In July, Mr. Gaspin added NBC’s entertainment division to a portfolio that also includes the company’s entertainment cable properties, like USA and Bravo, as well the Spanish-language network, Telemundo. He said that soon after he took up the job, he gave NBC Universal’s chief executive, Jeff Zucker, a simple message:“We’re going to have to pay.”NBC had for several years been contracting, part of a stated strategy to rewrite the financial rules of television. Last spring, the network ordered  only 10 pilots for new series; this year, it almost doubled that number.“You can only manage through cost cuts for a short period of time,” Mr. Gaspin said. “And we’ve been doing it for five years.”That NBC has paid a price for that strategy was evident in Mr. Gaspin’s inclusion of the phrase “amount of loss” in his list of concessions to reality. The network’s entertainment division, which once made as much $800 million in a year, is now on the wrong side of the ledger — probably to the tune of about $300 million, according to some analyst projections.Even as it is being examined for all its flaws by Comcast, its prospective new owner, NBC has multiple holes in its schedule and few continuing hits. It has also just come through a ferocious public-relations battering.The insertion of the late-night star Jay Leno at 10 p.m. five nights a week last year proved to be an instant flop, which led to the upheaval  that pushed its other late-night star, Conan O’Brien, from the network.So the fix-it list is long, but Mr. Gaspin has made a start. The patchwork schedule he put together at 10 p.m. this winter has managed to exceed expectations, providing some  breathing room. NBC has been up over 40 percent in the 18- to 49-year-old audience, which is highly sought by many advertisers, with shows like “Law and Order: Special Victims Unit” and “Parenthood” in Mr. Leno’s old time slot.That rebound has been critical after what Mr. Gaspin conceded were years of turmoil at NBC. “We want to be a calming force in the company. We can’t look like we’re flailing.” He added, “We have to look like we know what we’re doing, and we have things under control — which I think we do.”One big step was opening itself to the best program ideas available,   no matter where they came from. In recent years, the networks have relied more heavily than ever on buying from their own studios,  hoping to cash in on selling shows internationally and in syndication.NBC is in no position to be picky. “Our goal right now is to find those shows that are the tent poles of your schedule,” Mr. Gaspin said. “I don’t care where they come from. I don’t care whether we own them or not.”This has played nicely into the hands of the Warner Brothers studio, which has delivered some of the most talked about potential new shows to NBC, including dramas developed by prominent  creators like J. J. Abrams (“Lost”) and Jerry Bruckheimer (“CSI”). Bruce Rosenblum, the president of Warner Brothers Television Group, said the studio had “a lot tied up” in an NBC comeback.Mr. Abrams’s new show, “Under Covers,” was expensive to acquire, and the pilot may have cost as much as $10 million to produce (with Mr. Abrams directing). But it has a commodity that has been in short supply at NBC: buzz.Mr. Bruckheimer’s drama, “The Chase,” is another of his intense  police procedurals. If either show becomes a lasting hit, Warner Brothers will reap the main financial benefit. Mr. Gaspin said building NBC’s own Universal studio can only be a “long-term” goal right now. “That’s a great asset if we can get there; I’ve got to get there first.”Can he do it? The pressure is certainly on, though Mr. Gaspin said  that comparing the shows’ results with the results of the fall, when Mr. Leno’s show was struggling, might  help a bit.“Absolutely there are a lot of chips on the table for NBC,” said Brad Adgate, the senior vice president for research at  Horizon Media.So it won’t be easy. Steve Sternberg, the longtime research analyst for advertising agencies who now writes his own Sternberg Report, said in an e-mail message: “Only NBC’s Thursday comedies, ‘Parenthood,’ ‘Law and Order,’ and  ‘S.V.U.’ are virtually guaranteed to return next season. The network needs to come up with new scripted series.”But he added, “The network races are still so close, one or two new successes — certainly not out of the realm of possibility — could help turn things around.”Some other prospective shows that are building talk for NBC include a new law-based hour from the prolific legal-show creator David E. Kelley (“Ally McBeal”) called “Kindreds”; a remake of the classic series “The Rockford Files,” from David Shore, the creator of “House”; and a quirky romantic comedy hour, “Love Bites,” from Cindy Chupack, a writer on “Sex and the City.”Mr. Gaspin, who said he would also like to find several new comedies to give himself a chance to open a second night (beyond Thursdays) for the genre, professed to be “cautiously optimistic” about NBC’s development slate.The key, he said, is to begin to rebuild NBC’s brand, which he set at a high bar. “We’re a network of quality, sophisticated content.”As for that late-night mess — which featured Mr. Gaspin as the architect of the short-lived plan to move Mr. Leno to 11:35 p.m. in a half-hour show, sliding Mr. O’Brien back to 12:05 a.m. — it is no longer on Mr. Gaspin’s radar.He said he was  not worried about recent erosion in Mr. Leno’s ratings back at “The Tonight Show.” “I look at him compared to Letterman,” he said, referencing the CBS late-night star David Letterman. “He’s still got the same margin of victory.”Over all, Mr. Gaspin said, “late night’s not my problem anymore.” Why? Because, he said, “he’s going to cable.”“He” means Mr. O’Brien, who signed to bring his show to the cable channel TBS in November, after a long dalliance with the Fox network.“I don’t have to worry about Conan anymore,” Mr. Gaspin said. “Whereas if he was on Fox we’d all be, you know, what’s it going to do?” Mr. Gaspin said:  “That’s all over. The Conan story is gone for me.”"
Coupons Are Making a Comeback,"After coupon redemption dropped for three straight years, the recession induced consumers to clip and click for savings again as redemption soared 27 percent in 2009, the second-highest annual growth ever recorded.According to a Nielsen report, newspapers remain the main source of coupon distribution, at 89 percent, and newspaper inserts account for the most coupons redeemed, at 53 percent. Redemption growth on the Internet leaped 263 percent last year.Despite the gains, coupons remain concentrated among a narrow audience: 22 percent of households were responsible for 83 percent of units bought with coupons, and total units declined for all groups but the heaviest coupon users. The coupon aggregator RetailMeNot reports that online coupon use has continued to rise this year, with year-over-year growth of 62 percent in February.Perhaps surprisingly, the more affluent, educated, suburban and white a household is, the more likely it is to take advantage of coupons.“The most popular form of redeemed coupons, free-standing inserts, is still delivered as a supplement in Sunday newspapers, and newspaper circulation and readership among affluent households is higher than general population,” said Todd Hale, Nielsen’s senior vice president for  Consumer and Shopper Insights.TEDDY WAYNE "
Systemic Risk Knows No Borders,"Big  banks are getting separation anxiety. They don’t want to spin off their lucrative derivatives desks, even into subsidiaries.The idea, which is part of financial reform legislation being debated in the Senate, has merit. It would rid the derivatives market of perceived taxpayer support and discourage risky speculation. But international cooperation will be critical.Some $30 billion of revenue is at stake, so the concern from Wall Street isn’t surprising. The proposal may not survive Senate horse-trading. Even if it does, it’s not clear whether it would require completely severing the derivatives apron strings, or only a loosening by way of separately capitalized derivatives subsidiaries.Either way, banks have sounded the alarm. The separation would require lots  of new capital — more than $100 billion by one industry estimate. There also would be uncomfortable unwinding pains, including ones related to technological infrastructure and ending the one-stop financial shop.Yet Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas and the champion of the provision, says that there should be a clear division between banking activities that the government  should support or at least provide liquidity to, and riskier business that it should not. This makes some sense in many ways.Stand-alone swap desks would inevitably make derivatives more expensive, and thereby discourage excessive speculation. The setup also would give banks cover, whether they think they need it or not, from accusations that taxpayers are backstopping risky trading. If banks find excising swaps desks alone too difficult for clients who want a suite of trading services, they could always return to a full separation of traditional and investment banking functions.A major problem with the proposal is that it would send much derivatives business to  banks based outside the United States. That is, if other jurisdictions do not follow suit. American banks might be safer, but at the expense of their competitiveness.Without overseas cooperation, the problem of global systemic risk wouldn’t be fully addressed either. For banks to successfully be separated from their derivatives, both American lawmakers and their international counterparts would need to work together.No Family FeudThe Pritzker family appears to be cashing out in unusually amicable fashion. The sale of a majority stake in the  credit reporting firm TransUnion is the latest step by the Chicago clan to unwind its $15 billion empire. Earlier squabbles over the spoils looked ominous for the plan. But it seems to have gone relatively well compared with the trouble many rich families face.American dynasties tend to resemble, well, “Dynasty.”Selling off the family silver often turns nasty, or at best clumsy.The Koch brothers fought a bitter battle for ownership of the family oil services business. The Dorrances, of Campbell Soup, watched their franchise deteriorate, and then wrangled over whether to exit. In 2007, the Bancrofts tripped all over themselves when it came to selling Dow Jones to Rupert Murdoch.The Pritzkers have had their soap opera moments, too. In 2002, Liesel and Matthew Pritzker accused relatives of looting their trust funds. The lawsuits resulted in $450 million settlements for the pair, no small hiccup in the proceedings. But since that resolution, the rest of the family has moved along smoothly to execute its agreement to divide the fortune by 2011.The results have been fruitful. Conwood, a smokeless tobacco company,  went to Reynolds American for a robust $3.5 billion in 2006. Then, Warren E. Buffett’s company paid $4.5 billion for 60 percent of Marmon Holdings, giving the Pritzkers nine times operating income for their industrial conglomerate. Most recently, the Pritzkers floated a quarter of Hyatt Hotels for $950 million, a price that translated to 13 times earnings even though the family would retain control.The TransUnion deal appears to follow this solid trend. The sale of 51 percent to the private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners looks likely to  value the company at north of $2 billion. That’s in line with its rivals, Experian and Equifax.Younger generations often struggle with their corporate inheritances. But heirs elsewhere would do well to stop watching the growing number of their wealthy peers turning up on reality TV and pay closer attention to how the Pritzkers have moved past the drama.
