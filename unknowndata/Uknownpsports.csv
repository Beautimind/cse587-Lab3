Off-Field Turmoil Causes Soul Searching at Oregon,"EUGENE, Ore. — As the Oregon football team scrimmaged on a recent morning under overcast skies at Autzen Stadium, Jeremiah Masoli stood on the sidelines, his hands tucked inside the pouch on the front of his practice jersey and his helmet deposited under the bench behind him.For more than 90 minutes, Masoli did not take any snaps at quarterback, did not fill in at receiver as he has done at some spring practices, did not do anything more taxing than try to stifle a yawn.Masoli, the deft operator of one of college football’s most innovative offenses last fall, when he led Oregon to the Rose Bowl, was to have been a Heisman Trophy contender for a team that was expected to be in the hunt for a national title. Perhaps, as it did for Joey Harrington nearly a decade ago, Oregon would have plastered a billboard of Masoli on a Manhattan building.Instead, he is the face of Oregon athletics for a different reason: a program run amok.Masoli has been suspended for the coming season after pleading guilty in March to a felony burglary charge for stealing a laptop from a fraternity house. He is one of six players who were arrested during a span of several weeks.The problems at Oregon, which completes its spring practice Saturday with its annual spring game, have not been confined to the police blotter. The state attorney general launched an investigation into the $2.3 million buyout of Athletic Director Mike Bellotti, the former football coach whose “contract” turned out to be a handshake agreement. Though no wrongdoing was found, the attorney general, John Kroger, said the arrangement exposed the university to financial risk by not following procedures.The hiring of a basketball coach was no more smooth. By the time Dana Altman was hired last Sunday, after fruitless overtures to Tom Izzo, Brad Stevens, Jamie Dixon and Mike Anderson, among others, the job search had taken six weeks, or long enough that three players had asked for their releases.Now, Oregon must find an athletic director — one who will have to figure out how to make the bond payments on the new $227 million basketball arena that will open next season, among other things.“It’s time for the athletic department to do a little soul searching on how they can serve the university,” said Nathan Tublitz, a biology professor and the president of the university senate. “The athletic department is out of control here.”The tension between athletics and academics has been longstanding at Oregon, since the university in the mid-1990s — with the backing of the donor Phil Knight, the Nike co-founder — began pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into its athletic facilities, which are among the most opulent in the country. Before Bellotti,  the department had been run by its No. 2 benefactor, the booster turned athletic director Pat Kilkenny.Football players, who a generation ago hung their backpacks on nails, now walk into a two-story, wood-paneled locker room with 60-inch flat-screen televisions and Internet ports at every locker. A new learning center — dubbed the Jock Box for its glass cube design — has been built primarily for athletes.If athletes at Oregon want a top-of-the-line laptop, they only need to request one and pay $100 a year to insure it — Knight donated 550 specially engraved Apple notebooks for their use.That twist,  in the wake of Masoli’s arrest, has not been lost on many around campus. When guard Mark Asper, a sociology and Spanish major, has pulled his laptop out in class, he has had classmates admire it and then ask the inevitable question.“Is that one Jeremiah could have gotten?” Asper said. “And I say, yes. They want to know: What was he thinking? I just have to humbly apologize. People say, ‘Oh, you guys are a bunch of hooligans,’ and it’s tough because you don’t have any evidence to the contrary.”A case in point came in late February. Coach Chip Kelly called a team meeting after several arrests. He outlined the standards  he expected his players to adhere to and then affirmed at a news conference that he had not lost control of the program. Less than 24 hours later, linebacker Kiko Alonso was arrested for driving under the influence. The next day, receiver Jamere Holland, believing Alonso had been kicked off the team, unleashed an expletive-laced rant against Kelly on his Facebook page.Kelly has dismissed three players, including Holland, and suspended two others — Masoli and Alonso — for the season. LaMichael James, the team’s best running back, and kicker Rob Beard were each suspended for one game, possibly more, after pleading guilty to physical harassment in separate cases involving women.So, rather than distancing themselves from the behavior of LeGarrette Blount, whose nationally televised sucker punch of a Boise State player was one of college football’s enduring images last season, the Ducks demonstrated in the early days of the off-season that birds of a feather do indeed flock together.Kelly, who was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach in 2009 when Bellotti was made athletic director, said he did not believe his message was getting lost. He pointed to the fact that there were no off-the-field incidents in his first nine months on the job.“You have to understand — kids are 18 to 22 years old,” Kelly said. “They’re going to make mistakes and when they do, there will be punishment.”In his office last week, Kelly turned to his desktop computer and clicked on the college football home page for ESPN.com. Of the nine headlined stories, five were about players in some sort of trouble. He also cited statistics  well known around Eugene. Florida has had 27 football player arrests in five years; Alabama had 10 arrests in Nick Saban’s first 18 months as coach; Ohio State had 14 arrests between 2001 and 2004; and Penn State had 46 arrests between 2002 and 2007.“It happens everywhere, it happens in every sport,” Kelly said. “The problem is we’re a high-profile sport and we live in a fish bowl, so people know about it. And our players understand that. One is too many, but our players have to understand that they’re looked at differently than a normal student and everything they do is going to be scrutinized, so you have to do the right things.”Curt Warner, the former Penn State running back who starred for the Seattle Seahawks, attended practice last week with his son, who is a high school sophomore in Vancouver, Wash. He echoed Kelly, saying that Oregon’s problems could have happened in any era, but said it was important for players to realize they were ambassadors, for better or worse.“The question for everyone is whether this is a one-time incident,” Warner said. “I would think it’s one of those things, but time will tell.”What troubles some is that Masoli and James had been arrested before arriving in Eugene. Masoli spent three months in juvenile hall in 2005 for his role in a series of robberies at a Bay Area shopping mall. James was arrested in 2008 and charged with battery and disorderly conduct after being involved in a fight, but the charges were dropped a year later. Masoli, through a university spokesman, declined to be interviewed. James said he had learned “big time” from his recent arrest, but that it was fair to wonder if someone who had been arrested twice could stay out of trouble.“I can’t predict the future,” he said. “I’m 20 years old. I’ve had two incidents happen in my whole life. You can’t judge a person on an incident that happened in high school. I’m sure other kids have had incidents that have happened in high school.”One person keeping a close eye will be Dr. Richard Lariviere, who last summer became the university’s president.One of his stated priorities was to figure out a way to raise professors’ salaries, which lag behind national standards, despite increasingly tight state funding.Lately, his focus has been on sports. Lariviere called the spate of off-the-field troubles “unacceptable” and acknowledged in a news conference that he pushed out Bellotti, who took a job last month with ESPN. Last week, after The Eugene Register-Guard reported that Kilkenny had also operated without a contract for more than a year, Lariviere reassigned the university counsel Melinda Grier to the campus law school and announced that her contract would not be renewed when it expired in 2011.The moves appear to highlight an acknowledgment of the gap between how the university and the athletic department have been run — one beholden to state lawmakers, the other a seemingly freestanding corporation.And they raise further questions about the proper balance between athletics and academics here.“We’ve really reached a tipping point,” said Dr. Steven Ungerleider, a sports psychologist in Eugene. “You have to have this homeostatic balance — you can’t just run athletics as an entity by itself. What I think is important is that the University of Oregon is a unique place — most alums and most donors want to see a healthy balance. They want to see a school jump up in the academic rankings and not just see a top-five football team. We are really at a crossroads. I would hope the new administration would see this as a new opportunity and not a Band-Aid.”"
"Woods Misses Fairways, Greens and the Cut","CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The second round of the Quail Hollow Championship turned into a day of extreme rarities on Friday at Quail Hollow Club. Billy Mayfair, a pudgy 43-year-old who has not won in 12 years, shot his second straight 68 and took the lead. Tiger Woods, the No. 1-ranked golfer in the world, shot a 79 and took a hike, missing a cut for only the sixth time in his professional career.And then there was the unidentified heckler who was escorted from the 17th hole by security guards after hollering some remarks at Woods about his extramarital affairs after Woods left the green for the 18th tee.It is a rare Friday at a  PGA Tour event when the tournament leader reaches eight under par while playing in relative obscurity, as Mayfair did. In front of a small audience, Mayfair hit all but two fairways and birdied seven holes (while bogeying three) to take a one-stroke lead over Ángel Cabrera, who shot a 67 while playing alongside Woods, and a two-stroke lead over four others: Phil Mickelson (68), Dustin Johnson (65), Paul Goydos (70) and J. P. Hayes (64).While Mayfair was putting together his best two rounds of the past 18 months, the bulk of the record crowd was taking in the morbidly curious spectacle of Woods’s coming apart at the seams. It all happened on the back nine, where his incoming 43 matched his nine-hole high and left him at nine-over 153, the highest 36-hole score of his career.Other previous marks against which Woods is rarely measured: the last time he missed a cut was last July at the British Open at Turnberry, and the last time he missed one at a regular PGA Tour event was in the 2005 Funai Classic. No one could recall the last time Woods four-putted a green, which he did at the 15th on Friday, nor could anyone recall the last time he pitched a ball into the water from 47 yards, as he did at the 14th hole.Those back-to-back double bogeys were the first of their kind for Woods since the Arnold Palmer Invitational in 2007, when he double-bogeyed the 17th hole and triple-bogeyed the 18th.He missed the cut by eight shots.How did he take it? Rather well, all things considered, doffing his cap at the final hole before shaking hands and smiling with Cabrera and Stewart Cink, who missed the cut by two strokes after shooting 72-75. Woods  hit only two fairways but had zero outbursts and pounded no clubs.“Yeah, I didn’t play well,” he said, “and more importantly, my short game wasn’t very good. I chipped poorly, putted poorly, but for the most part I didn’t really hit the ball that poorly until the end, when it was already pretty much out of reach.“It’s frustrating. I didn’t have much. You have to let it go. It’s like baseball. You go 0 for 4 two days in a row like I did, you’ve got a whole new tournament next week, which is great.”And there are a few great things about this week’s event, not the least being the opportunity Mickelson has to pull a bit closer to Woods in the rankings. A victory here would give Mickelson a 4-0 edge in the last four tournaments in which both he and Woods competed.For now, Mickelson said he was not looking at anything except the third round. Though he let a couple of birdie chances slide on his incoming nine holes after playing the more difficult back nine first in four-under-par 32, he managed to go around without a bogey and had four par-saving putts of 7 feet or more.“I thought I was going to get a few more birdies,” Mickelson said of the easier front nine. “I didn’t hit great shots that nine holes and I didn’t take advantage of the two opportunities I had on the par-5s, which kind of stalled the round. But four under —  I would say I’m in good position for the weekend.”Everyone among the 14 players within the top nine and ties could say the same. Even the first-round leader Bo Van Pelt, who shot a 76 to give way to Mayfair, is not totally out of it at three-under 141, tied for 14th. The only players mathematically eliminated are those who missed the cut at one over, and for the first time since last July that list included Woods.Woods might have been more disturbed than he let on, but he hid it well if he was. “At least I get the weekend to watch and see how it’s done, how real players play golf,” he said. “And hopefully I can piece it together for next week and be ready to go.”Maybe so. Cink witnessed the round up close, and even he was matter-of-fact about what he had seen from Woods.“Well, he hit a bunch of crooked shots off the tee and didn’t have the heroic up-and-down shots like he always does,” Cink said. “He kind of got steamrolled on the back nine. Happens to the best of them.”"
Rays&#8217; Error in 9th Opens Door for Royals,"An error by reliever Randy Choate helped Kansas City score twice in the ninth inning Friday night, and the visiting Royals held on to beat the Tampa Bay Rays for only the second time in 12 games, 3-2.Scott Podsednik reached base safely when Choate (0-2) misplayed his comebacker to start the ninth. After Billy Butler singled and Jose Guillen was hit by a pitch from closer Rafael Soriano, Alberto Callaspo put the Royals ahead, 2-1, with a sacrifice fly. Mitch Maier followed with a single to push Kansas City’s lead to 3-1.Evan Longoria homered and drove in two runs for the Rays, whose 17-5 record entering Friday was the best 22-game start since the 2003 San Francisco Giants (18-4). Longoria nearly won the game  in the bottom of the ninth, but his drive to left with two on was caught at the wall for a sacrifice fly, and Joakim Soria retired B. J. Upton on a fly ball for his sixth save.SORIANO FUELS CUBS’ RALLY The Cubs hit four home runs, including a three-run shot by Alfonso Soriano in the sixth inning that gave them their first lead, and Chicago beat the visiting Arizona Diamondbacks, 11-5. Kosuke Fukudome, Geovany Soto and Marlon Byrd also homered as the Cubs  stopped a three-game losing streak. It was the most runs the Cubs had scored at Wrigley Field this season. “It really came at the right time,” Manager Lou Piniella said.MORNEAU HOMERS IN RETURN After sitting out two games because of a stiff back, first baseman Justin Morneau made an instant impact in his return to the Twins’ lineup: he hit a two-run homer against Fausto Carmona (3-1) in Minnesota’s 9-3 victory against the host Cleveland Indians. Manager Ron Gardenhire said Morneau’s recent back stiffness was not related to the back injury that forced him to miss the last month of the 2009 season, including the playoffs.ORIOLES TOP RED SOX IN 10 Adam Jones doubled in the bottom of the 10th inning, then scored on a two-out single by Miguel Tejada to give the  Baltimore Orioles a 5-4 victory against the Boston Red Sox. Tejada drove in three runs, and tied the score with a home run in the eighth after the Orioles squandered a 3-1 lead. The victory ended the Orioles’ seven-game skid against Boston at Camden Yards. J. D. Drew homered twice for the Red Sox, who completed their first losing April (11-12) since 1996.YOUNG STARS HELP END BRAVES’ SLIDE Jason Heyward hit a tie-breaking, two-run homer, and Tommy Hanson (2-2) allowed two runs in eight innings to help the Atlanta Braves end their nine-game losing streak with a 4-2 victory against the visiting Houston Astros. It was the Braves’ longest losing streak since June 2006, when they dropped 10 straight.TIGERS USE 8-RUN 4TH TO TOP ANGELS The rookies Scott Sizemore and Brennan Boesch hit their first career home runs in an eight-run fourth inning, and the host Detroit Tigers beat the Los Angeles Angels, 10-6. Austin Jackson went 5 for 5 and became the first Tigers rookie with five hits in a game since the player he replaced, Curtis Granderson, did it Sept. 18, 2005. Joel Pineiro (2-3) gave up a career-high 10 runs in three and a third innings.BLUE JAYS  SLUG THEIR WAY PAST THE A’S Alex Gonzalez hit two home runs, Vernon Wells also homered and the host Toronto Blue Jays beat the Oakland Athletics, 10-2. The Blue Jays, who lead the American League with 35 home runs, sent the A’s to their sixth straight road loss. Before the game, the A’s placed catcher Kurt Suzuki on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to April 24, because of a strained muscle in his side.CUBS’ SPRING TRAINING FUTURE UNCLEAR Mesa’s status as the Cubs’ spring training home is in jeopardy after the Arizona Legislature adjourned Thursday without a stadium-financing plan to keep the team in the state. An agreement between the Cubs and city officials allows the team to negotiate with other cities if state lawmakers do not pass legislation by July 12. The move could reopen the door for Florida to lure away the Cubs, baseball’s highest-drawing spring training team.BOB UECKER HAS HEART SURGERY The Milwaukee Brewers’ radio announcer, Bob Uecker, 75, had heart surgery and is expected to make a full recovery in 10 to 12 weeks. Uecker’s surgeon called the operation — a six-hour procedure that included a coronary bypass and the replacement of Uecker’s aortic valve, aortic root and part of his ascending aorta — a success."
Rookie Lands in the Water but Above the Cut Line,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Before Friday, Garth Mulroy’s greatest claim to fame was finishing tied for 46th the only time he made the cut in a PGA Tour event.That was until Mulroy found himself ahead of Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and just about every other golfer for a stretch Friday afternoon at the Quail Hollow Championship. Mulroy, a first-year PGA Tour player who had not made the cut in seven events this year, was briefly tied atop the leader board with Bo Van Pelt before finishing with a one-under-par 71. That put him at four under for the tournament — four shots off the lead.“Yeah, I’m playing nicely, swinging well,” said Mulroy, a native of South Africa who played at North Carolina State and lives in Raleigh. “I could probably still make a few more putts. But as long as they start going in on the weekend, I’ll be fine.”That he will even play on the weekend is a step up for Mulroy, who earned his Tour card after finishing 14th on the Nationwide Tour last year and winning his first career event there — the South Georgia Classic. He played his first Tour event last year, finishing tied for 46th at the World Golf Championships at Doral and earning $52,000 after qualifying based on his performance on the South African Sunshine Tour.His PGA Tour winnings so far this year: $0.“Starting off, I wasn’t playing well, struggling with my swing,” said Mulroy, who has also played two Nationwide Tour events this year. “It took some time to get my swing straightened up. As it started to come back, the putter went cold. It’s not fun missing cuts, but at the same time, I wasn’t playing well. So I wasn’t overly worried about, you know, I’m missing cuts because all these guys are better than I am. It was more, I’m just not playing well, so it’s tough to make a cut.”That changed Thursday, when Mulroy opened with a three-under 69. He reached seven under after 16 holes on Friday. That included an eagle on No. 10 that tied Mulroy with Van Pelt for the lead.It was the first appearance of Mulroy’s name on a leader board in a PGA Tour event.“It’s nice seeing it up there,” he said. “It sort of encourages you just a little bit. And it keeps you maybe a little more focused.”His fairy-tale trip to the lead came to an abrupt and ugly end on No. 17, a picturesque 217-yard par-3 that is bordered on the front and left by a lake. Woods hit his tee shot into the water there Thursday. Mulroy topped that Friday.Mulroy not only put his tee shot into the water, but he also put his second shot there. He triple-bogeyed the hole, dropping back to four under for the tournament.“My first one was good, just got stood up right at the end,” Mulroy said, blaming the gusty winds. “You could see it. The second one was, it was right at the flag the whole way and right at the end it moved hard left with another gust, and bounced in the water.”It was a crushing end to an otherwise stellar round, which was why Mulroy did not feel like celebrating his making the cut.“I’m sort of laid back for the most part, but I’m still thinking about 17 a bit,” he said.If not for that triple bogey, Mulroy might have made a name for himself among the leaders going into Saturday.But it could be worse. At least he is not going home.Like Woods."
Mets Take Trip to Right Places to Find Their Bats,"PHILADELPHIA — After matching the club record for the best homestand in club history by going 9-1, the Mets proved they could definitely succeed in the spacious surroundings of Citi Field. But they have yet to demonstrate that they can handle more modest outfields like those in Philadelphia and Cincinnati.The Mets began a six-game trip Friday to those two cities, where the stadiums are particularly conducive to high offensive production. Citizen’s Bank Park in Philadelphia, where the Mets played the Phillies on Friday, has an outfield wall that is just 329 feet down the left-field line and 330 down the right.Manager Jerry Manuel was wondering before Friday’s game if playing in these offense-oriented stadiums would help the Mets get into a more productive hitting groove as they entered the second month of the season.“These appear to be hitter’s parks and I’m kind of anxious to see how we do from an offensive point of view in these two parks,” he said. “Obviously, we’ve had good pitching, but these are considered hitters’ parks and we really haven’t hit well yet. I’m waiting to see how this all comes together when we hit well and get the good pitching.”The Mets went into the game with a team batting average of .240, which was 14th in the 16-team National League. Their 14 home runs put them in 13th place. Although his hitters were more productive toward the end of their homestand, they still were not where Manuel wanted them to be offensively.Asked what he would like to see his hitters do better — whether it was situational hitting, showing more patience at the plate or just yanking more balls over the walls — Manuel had a simple preference.“I would just like to see us get more hits,” he declared. “I think power will come. I think we just need to string together more hits. We seem to not get those hits until a little later in the game. And they are timely, but I’d like to see us get on a nice streak with the bats and see what that looks like.”As tempting as it might be for hitters to make up for lost opportunities at Citi Field by trying to pad their statistics in these smaller parks, the Mets’ batters need to remain disciplined. Bad habits could arise from trying to tailor a swing to the dimensions of a specific park, especially a smaller one.“One of the things you can do every once in a while if you are not careful is go to a place like Philadelphia or Cincinnati and sometimes try and get in that home-run mode there,” Jeff Francoeur said. “You can absolutely do that. A lot of guys do that. But you can’t. You have to go with the same approach.”INSIDE PITCHDaniel Murphy played five innings at first base Friday in an extended spring training game in Port St. Lucie, Fla. Murphy is recovering from a sprained knee he injured March 30 in spring training. ... The minor league relief pitcher Sean Green has a stress fracture in a rib on his right side and was examined at the Hospital for Special Surgery. ... Reliever Ryota Igarashi, out with a left hamstring injury, is playing catch on flat ground in Port St. Lucie, but has not thrown off a mound yet. ... A large contingent of regular players showed up for early batting practice Friday, including David Wright, Jeff Francoeur, Johan Santana and Mike Pelfrey. ... Jerry Manuel said that catcher Rod Barajas would get Saturday’s unusual 3:10 p.m. start. The game is beginning at that time because of Fox’s Nascar coverage later in the day."
"Guillen Echos Union, Criticizing Arizona Law","Ozzie Guillen, the manager of the Chicago White Sox, said “I am an immigrant” and spoke forcefully Friday about Arizona’s much-debated new law, which seeks to crack down on illegal immigrants.Guillen, a native of Venezuela who became a United States citizen, is famous in baseball for saying exactly what he thinks. In this instance, he offered a spirited defense of Hispanics who come to the United States for jobs.Guillen said that many immigrants were exploited, that most of them were hard workers who caused no trouble and that they did many jobs that Americans did not want to do.“This country could not survive without Mexicans, all the Latinos,” Guillen said. “They cannot live without us. A lot of people from this country, they’re very lazy. They want to be on the computer and sending e-mail, and we do the hard work. We’re the ones who work in the sun all day long to make this country better.”Guillen spoke in the visitors’ dugout at Yankee Stadium before his team opened a three-game series with the Yankees.His comments came shortly after the Major League Baseball Players Association expressed its opposition to the law, which directs police forces in Arizona to check citizenship identification of people suspected of being in the country illegally.In addition, the Arizona Diamondbacks’ principal owner, Ken Kendrick, issued a statement Friday in which he expressed distress over the controversy created by the law and called on the federal government to address the issue of immigration.Guillen’s team is one of 15 in the major leagues that train in Arizona in February and March. But Guillen said he was not concerned that Latin American players would be stopped and questioned by the Arizona police.“If they pull you over and say, ‘Let me see your driver’s’ license,’ you show them,” Guillen said. “But the funny thing about it is most of the police who stop you, their last names are Hernandez and Rojas.”As Guillen spoke, he did not seem overly emotional about the subject. But he eagerly answered all questions about it and said he had been following news reports in recent days.“Some people are upset about it — I’m upset about it,” Guillen said. “I wish I could do more than what I’m doing.”Guillen said laborers who do not speak English were sometimes exploited in the United States. “We’re abused,” he said. “They’re cheaper, or they can’t say no. They are underpaid and they are still working.”Guillen said Hispanic workers forced out of Arizona would cross into other states to find work.“Believe me, we’re pretty smart,” Guillen said. “We come all the way from Mexico, Guatemala, Venezuela, and you’ve got to cross the border and we did it.  We’re going to spread all over the place. We’re going to keep moving around. We’re not leaving because we’re not doing anything wrong.”Guillen also said that once one state passed a law like this, “every state is going to come up with the same stuff.”One of the concerns that prompted passage of the law, its advocates said, was fear of crime. Guillen said he felt that 98 percent of the immigrant workers were law-abiding.“People don’t come here to do bad stuff,” Guillen said. “Maybe 2 or 3 percent come here to do stupid things.”He said most people did not realize that farm workers arose at 4 a.m. and worked until 6 p.m., “picking all kinds of stuff.”“Nobody complains about that,” Guillen said. “Leave those guys alone. Help them.”Much debate has been heard about a comprehensive change in immigration law, but such talks have stalled in Congress. Guillen urged action.“Put a law,” he said. “Get a visa, a working visa. Do something different to maintain these guys here. The sooner you do that, the less illegal people are going to be here. This problem should have been resolved a long time ago. Don’t wait.”Guillen said he doubted that most of his players were concerned about the Arizona law or even informed about it.Jorge Posada, the Yankees’ catcher, is from Puerto Rico. He said the union had sent players an e-mail about the matter on Thursday. But Posada declined to offer comment.“I’m not a politician, I’m a baseball player,” Posada said. “It’s tough to answer that one. Yeah, we heard about it. Not much you can say about it.”IT’S NEWS TO PIERZYNSKI On the Yankees’ last trip, Alex Rodriguez caused a commotion in Oakland when he crossed over the pitching mound while returning to first base after a foul ball. His action infuriated Athletics pitcher Dallas Braden.Braden said it was a violation of baseball etiquette to do such a thing; he said players should avoid the mound and respect the space of the pitcher.A. J. Pierzynski, the White Sox catcher and a player with a reputation for agitating the other team, said Friday that he might have done the same thing in the past.“I’m sure I have; I’m sure everyone has,” Pierzynski said. “You don’t even think about it. I see guys cross the mound all the time. You just run the quickest way. If it’s across the mound, it’s across the mound.”Pierzynski said he had never thought about it before the Rodriguez incident.“I’ve never known it to be an issue,” he said. “Obviously, with Alex, things get turned into bigger stories than they are. I’m sure if Alex would have known, he wouldn’t have done it.”"
"After Bullying Lesser Teams, Mets Beat Up One of the Best","PHILADELPHIA — After battering three slumping opponents during their recent 9-1 homestand, the Mets had to wonder what would happen when they took their act on the road against one of the National League’s elite teams.It turned out to be pretty much the same thing, although this time it was even better for the Mets, and not just because it came against their bitter rivals the Phillies.In what might have been their most complete game of the season, the Mets pitched, slugged and fielded their way to a 9-1 victory over the Phillies to extend their lead in the National League East. They finished the month of April with eight straight victories.Starting pitcher Jon Niese produced his finest performance of the season, and his teammates hit four home runs and played superb defense. David Wright and Jeff Francoeur homered in the second inning, and the former Phillie Rod Barajas hit two homers and added a run-scoring double as the Mets pounded Philadelphia’s pitching.“Home is great, but you’ve got to win on the road,” Francoeur said, then added, “We’ve still got a long way to go, but to get a win like this tonight I think gave us some confidence to know that we can come into a place like this and win a ballgame.”The Phillies continued to struggle without the injured shortstop Jimmy Rollins, and they fell into third place behind the Washington Nationals, who are a game behind the Mets. The Phillies did not pitch well, and their offense seemed at a loss against Niese.Except for the second inning, when he required fine defensive efforts by his teammates to preserve a narrow lead, Niese was in command almost the entire game. He pitched seven strong innings, allowing one run and four hits. He struck out seven, matching the career high he set April 19 against the Cubs.After the second inning, in which he allowed Philadelphia’s only run, Niese set down 14 Phillies in a row before Jayson Werth singled in the seventh. But Niese stranded Werth with two strikeouts and a pop-up to complete his outing. But as good as Niese was, he was quick to acknowledge the key defensive plays behind him.The second inning alone produced two scintillating defensive plays as Francoeur and Jason Bay made catches to prevent runs.With a runner on first and nobody out in the bottom of the second, Raul Ibanez hit a drive to deep right-center field. Francoeur ran back and to his right and made a jumping catch. He then spun off the mesh cyclone fencing in front of the scoreboard, banged his knee and fell to the ground.He got back up quickly and threw the ball to the infield. Although he appeared to have been injured in the collision with the fence, he gave a dismissive wave to the trainers as they prepared to jog out to him.Phillies shortstop Juan Castro followed with a single to right. Werth went to third on the hit and later scored on Carlos Ruiz’s ground-ball single to left that made the score 3-1, and it appeared as if the Phillies were ready to storm back.But Bay saved at least two runs when he made a leaping catch at the wall in left to rob Shane Victorino of an extra-base hit.“I got in trouble in the second inning,” Niese said, “and Jason and Jeff made great plays and bailed me out.”The good defense continued in the sixth inning as Luis Castillo made a fine catch in shallow right field of Ryan Howard’s line drive. Castillo was playing on the grass because the Mets were in a defensive shift.The Mets’ offensive spurt began in the second inning, when Bay led off with an opposite-field double to right and Wright followed with a home run to center. He hit a low 0-1 fastball into the shrubbery at least five feet beyond the 409-foot sign in center field for his fourth home run.After Ike Davis made an out, Francoeur hit an 0-2 pitch into the seats beyond the left-field wall for his fourth home run.“It felt good to hit one that went out,” said Francoeur, referring to the smaller outfield at Citizens Bank Park compared with the expansive reaches of Citi Field.The only event that marred the Mets’ night occurred in the seventh inning, when Francoeur was hit on the left elbow by a pitch from Danys Baez. Francoeur scored on Barajas’s double but was replaced in right field by Gary Matthews Jr.Francoeur was examined by a Phillies doctor and was told he had a contusion on his left elbow. X-rays were negative. Manager Jerry Manuel said Francoeur probably would not play Saturday, but Francoeur held out hope.INSIDE PITCHRod Barajas came into the game with four home runs and 10 runs batted in his last six games against the Phillies, whose fans have booed him since he played for the team in 2007. He homered in fifth inning, doubled in the seventh and homered again in the ninth off Brad Lidge, the Phillies’ former and perhaps future closer, who returned from the disabled list earlier Friday. ... Daniel Murphy played five innings at first base in an extended spring training game in Port St. Lucie, Fla. Murphy is recovering from a sprained knee that he sustained March 30 in spring training."
White Sox Take Lead; Jeter Takes It Back,"When the Yankees have a number of regulars struggling, as they currently do, they can usually depend on a timely performance from their captain, Derek Jeter.Jeter had a two-run home run in the fifth inning and a two-run triple in the seventh Friday night as the Yankees opened a homestand against the Chicago White Sox with a 6-4 victory.Jeter also singled and scored in the first. And in the eighth, he scooted to his left for a ground ball, steadied himself and threw out Mark Kotsay in what might have been the game’s defensive highlight.Or perhaps the defensive highlight came in the fifth, when Jeter fielded a ground ball, caught Gordon Beckham in a base-running mistake and started a rundown that ended with Jeter’s tagging out Beckham.Starter Andy Pettitte, who went six innings, focused on Jeter’s hitting.“Oh, man,” Pettitte said. “Anybody ask me who you want up at the plate, in all the years I’ve played, he’s the man. He loves it. You can see it in his eyes. He embraces the situation.”Jeter raised his average 19 points, to .330. He has 4 home runs and 18 runs batted in. Jeter, who started the season with a .317 career average, first played for the Yankees in 1995,  when Manager Joe Girardi was still a player.“One day, it will come to an end,” Girardi said of Jeter’s career. “He’s meant so much to this team.”Among the slumping Yankees are Mark Teixeira, who is batting .136; Nick Johnson, at .138; Alex Rodriguez, at .250; and Curtis Granderson, .221. Of those four, only Rodriguez collected a hit Friday, a first-inning double.The White Sox took a 3-0 lead in the first against  Pettitte on a three-run home run by Paul Konerko, whose opposite-field fly ball to right landed on top of the fence and bounced over after eluding the glove of the leaping Nick Swisher.“I just made a stupid pitch,” Pettitte said.The ball was not especially well hit and resembled several home runs that fell into those same seats early last season and that gave the new Stadium its home run reputation.“He threw his bat down,” said Pettitte. “He thought he popped it up.”With Chicago leading, 4-2, in  the fifth inning, Jeter tied it on a two-out, two-run home run to left off Freddy Garcia. Jeter’s blast scored Brett Gardner, whose single and stolen base seemed to unnerve Garcia, who had retired the previous 12 hitters.“You have to like to be in those situations,” Jeter said. “It doesn’t mean you’re going to be successful all the time.”Chicago threatened in the seventh against Alfredo Aceves (2-0), with a man on second and  two out, but a line drive by Carlos Quentin was speared by Rodriguez at third.Jeter’s triple, to the opposite field, came off Matt Thornton and scored Francisco Cervelli, who had been hit by a pitch, and Gardner, who had singled for his second hit of the night.“It’s a lot of fun to be able to play with him,” Gardner said of Jeter. “It’s something I probably won’t appreciate enough until a long time down the road when I’m done playing.”It was the first game of a six-game homestand for the Yankees, who went 5-4 on their recent  trip to Oakland, Los Angeles and Baltimore.INSIDE PITCHJorge Posada, nursing a sore right knee, pinch-hit in the seventh after being replaced by Francisco Cervelli  in the lineup.  Posada and Manager Joe Girardi said Posada would probably start on Saturday or, at the latest, on Sunday. “The swelling’s got to go down, but it’s going to be all right,” Posada said. “I could play, but they gave me another day.” Posada was hit on Wednesday in Baltimore with a pitch by Jeremy Guthrie. Posada said he was aware that Guthrie had expressed regret. “He didn’t mean to, I didn’t see anything wrong with what he did,” Posada said. “He didn’t need to say what he said.” ... Javier Vazquez (1-3) will pitch for the Yankees on Saturday against John Danks (3-0) of the White Sox. Vazquez, who has struggled this season,  used to pitch for the White Sox, and Chicago Manager Ozzie Guillen has said Vazquez faltered in big games. Girardi said he hoped Vazquez would not be discouraged if fans booed him. “I think it’s possible he’s trying too hard,” Girardi said. He added that he did not want to judge Vazquez so early in the season and speculate about alternatives."
Seeking Single Home for Triple Crown,"If Bob Evans, the chief executive of Churchill Downs Inc., could turn his preference to reality, one television network would broadcast  the three Triple Crown races starting next year, as NBC did from 2001 to 2005.“I certainly hope that turns out to be the case,” Evans said Friday from Louisville, where the Kentucky Derby, the most-viewed of the Triple Crown races, will be run Saturday. “But I can’t do it alone.”He wants NBC to be that lone network, a departure from the current setup in which NBC has carried the Derby and the Preakness Stakes since 2006 and ESPN has shown the Belmont Stakes on ABC.Evans is enamored with the way that NBC has turned the Derby into a broader entertainment program by using its sister networks, like Bravo and CNBC, and programs like “Today” to promote the race.Mike McCarley, a senior vice president of NBC Sports, said, “Our ability to cross-promote to a broad audience, both men and women is one of our biggest advantages.”Women, who made up 52 percent of last year’s Derby viewership, have become crucial to boosting viewership.Last year, NBC attracted 16.3 million viewers, the most in 20 years, to see the 50-1 long shot Mine That Bird win the Derby. When Rachel Alexandra won the Preakness, 10.9 million watched, the second most in 20 years.“They’ve changed the way horse racing is presented,” said Evans, alluding to NBC’s Derby production and the series of pre-Derby prep races around the country that Churchill Downs and the network have collaborated on.Evans’s wish is not great news for ESPN. It snared the Belmont Stakes by capitalizing on the New York Racing Association’s dissatisfaction that it received only 25 percent of the $51.5 million that NBC paid in total from 2001 to 2005. The Derby received half the revenue and Pimlico, home to the Preakness Stakes, also received 25 percent.But the split network setup that grew out of  NYRA’s secession appears set to end with the expiration of NBC and ESPN/ABC’s contracts this year.NBC wants what Evans wants. ESPN wants, at the very least, to keep the Belmont Stakes and add races from Belmont Park and the Saratoga Race Course, which NYRA also runs.Len DeLuca, a senior vice president at ESPN, said he had been discussing a Belmont extension but that  NYRA’s chairman, C. Steven Duncker, had been “extremely transparent” in saying he will examine all options.ESPN would not mind acquiring the rights to the Derby and the Preakness. But DeLuca said that ESPN would be happy to receive a broader deal from  NYRA and continue to carry the Breeders’ Cup, which it has through 2013.Having only the Belmont presents a risk if a horse is not vying for the Triple Crown. Viewership spiked in recent years for Big Brown’s (2008), Smarty Jones’s (2004) and Funny Cide’s (2003) failed attempts to win the third race.  It is worth noting that with a Triple Crown at stake in each year from 2002 to 2004, NBC averaged 14.4 million viewers when it still carried the Belmont. Perhaps that is the benefit Evans is seeking in advocating to carry the races on one network. But in 2008, with Big Brown racing for a Triple Crown at Belmont Park, ABC drew 11.3 million viewers.“If you have all three, clearly you have an edge,” DeLuca said. “But the Triple Crown has survived over the past 40 years by being on one network, and being on two. These are championship events that stand on their own.”Although NBC’s and ESPN’s Triple Crown rights fees have not been disclosed, the recession’s effect and the state of horse racing (DeLuca politely calls it “volatile”) seems to give the networks leverage in future talks. Pimlico has been part of its parent company’s bankruptcy reorganization while  NYRA struggles financially. Churchill Downs, the strongest entity of the three, is well-positioned to lead the TV negotiations.Evans hedged when asked which side held the best hand. Asked if the races’ rights fees could drop, he said: “I’m trained as a quantitative economist. More is preferred to less.”DeLuca added, “We enter these negotiations in a different world.”It might look like a different world at the Derby on Saturday with torrential rains expected, at least through early afternoon.David Michaels, NBC’s director, said that the track could be a chaotic place. “You have animals running on dirt,” he said on a conference call Thursday. “You have mud everywhere, you have cameramen who are holding pointers to the sky that are nothing more than high-tech lightning rods.”Gary Stevens, who won three Derbys as a jockey and is NBC’s lead analyst, said on the call: “You can see these jockeys wearing up to 10 pairs of goggles. When you’ve got that many layers of goggles stacked up, everything becomes very distorted. Your vision is impaired significantly.”"
Lakers Eliminate Thunder on Gasol’s Putback With 0.5 Left,"OKLAHOMA CITY — Kobe Bryant was 38 feet from the basket, with only Russell Westbrook and several seconds remaining between him and a trip to the Western Conference semifinals. There was a quick drive, a fadeaway shot and a clang on the rim.For a moment, there was elation at the Ford Center, and then heartbreak. Pau Gasol seized the rebound with two hands, smacked it back toward the basket, and the ball passed through with 0.5 seconds left for a 95-94 Los Angeles Lakers lead.When Russell Westbrook missed a desperation shot at the buzzer, the Lakers had escaped with a six-game victory Friday night in this first-round series. They will play  Utah in a conference semifinal. The Jazz eliminated the Nuggets in six games with a 112-104 victory in Utah on Friday night.The Oklahoma City Thunder, which made a scintillating run through the regular season, watched its first playoff trip end suddenly.“That’s a very talented team, the best team in basketball until somebody proves that they’re not,” Thunder Coach Scott Brooks said of the Lakers.Bryant led the Lakers with 32 points despite foul trouble.Kevin Durant, the N.B.A.’s youngest scoring champion, struggled all night on offense, going 5 for 23 from the field. He finished with 26 points, getting most of his production at the free-throw line (14 for 15).Bryant spent an eight-and-a-half-minute stretch on the bench after picking up his fourth foul late in the third quarter. Oklahoma City could not capitalize, instead falling behind by 7 points. Bryant returned with 6 minutes 21 seconds left, his team ahead by 4.The lead vanished in a matter of minutes. Durant and Westbrook (21 points) combined for a 10-0 burst that gave the Thunder a 94-91 lead with 2:30 left. Bryant hit a 22-footer to make it a one-point game.The Lakers’ championship sheen was already blemished by an up-and-down regular season. Their grueling battle with the Thunder merely amplified the doubts — about Bryant’s finger, Derek Fisher’s legs and Lamar Odom’s head.The anxieties increased exponentially when the sprightly Thunder, led by Durant and Westbrook, won Games 3 and 4 convincingly here. It was considered so alarming that Ron Harper, a veteran of two Lakers championships, publicly upbraided his former team in an interview with The Los Angeles Times.The Lakers reclaimed their dominant edge with a 111-87 rout in Game 5, as Bryant (at his own request) took on and shut down Westbrook. He continued to shadow him Friday, holding Westbrook to 7-for-20 shooting.“It’s one of his strengths,”  Brooks said of Bryant’s defense. “When he’s engaged, he can defend just about as well as anybody in the league.”Offensively, Bryant alternated between careful playmaking and unbridled aggression. He chose the latter to open the second half, scoring 8 straight Lakers points, including a 3-pointer and a tough hanging jumper as the Lakers pushed ahead by 7.Bryant had 16 points in the third quarter, before picking up his third and fourth fouls in quick succession. He went to the bench with the Lakers holding a 73-67 lead. His replacement, Shannon Brown, promptly turned the ball over twice, and soon the game was tied again at 73-73.The Lakers have been down this prickly path before. Last year, they needed seven games to dispatch the undermanned Houston Rockets in the conference semifinals. Then, as now, the Lakers played just poorly enough to create a minor panic. A month later, they were hugging the Larry O’Brien trophy after beating the Orlando Magic.“This team hopefully learned something from last year’s,” Coach Phil Jackson said before tip-off.After playing the facilitator role for two games, Bryant moved back into attack mode. He took 11 shots in the first quarter — two more than he did in all of Game 5 — and pushed the Lakers to an early 9-point lead. But Bryant misfired often and had a sloppy first half, going 5 for 13 with three turnovers.Durant, hounded by Ron Artest, had a much harder time getting on track. He missed his first seven field-goal attempts but got to the free-throw line often (9 for 10) and scored 14 points in the half.Oklahoma City overcame the slow start and closed the first quarter with a 27-26 lead, moving the crowd —  clad in royal blue T-shirts — to sing its first chorus of “Beat L.A.!”Earlier in the evening, Brooks spoke admiringly of the Lakers and modestly of his own team, which entered the playoffs as the N.B.A.’s youngest.“We want to be an elite team,” Brooks said. “We’re not there now. We’re a team in progress.”"

International Raceway. “It just seems like a reasonable opportunity and it seemed like if there is a time to ever do it, this is one of those times.”Earnhardt announced his plan Thursday to drive the Wrangler car in the Nationwide Series race at Daytona. The announcement came on what would have been his father’s 59th birthday. Dale Earnhardt died in a crash in the season-opening Daytona 500 in 2001."

Browns&#8217; McCoy Discovers He Isn&#8217;t in Texas Anymore,"BEREA, Ohio (AP) — Colt McCoy grew up on a farm in Texas building fences, hauling hay and feeding cows.“It definitely taught me a lot of values at an early age,” he said.Hopefully patience was one of them.McCoy put on another orange jersey — a Cleveland Browns practice jersey — as part of the team’s first rookie minicamp last weekend. But the Browns’ president, Mike Holmgren, has already said he wanted McCoy, the 85th overall pick in the draft, to stay on the sideline next season learning behind Jake Delhomme and Seneca Wallace.That is fine with McCoy, at least for now.“Every quarterback is a competitor,” McCoy said. “I do see myself playing in the long term. I want to be out there. Ask anyone in this locker room what they want and they want to be suited up and playing. But right now my job is to come in and learn.”McCoy, who will wear No. 12, called joining the Browns “the perfect fit” even if he had to wait until the third round to be selected. McCoy, criticized before the draft by the former N.F.L. coach Jon Gruden for his southern drawl, barked out signals Friday and did his best to lead the rest of the players. It is what Holmgren and Coach Eric Mangini ask of all the rookies.“A lot of the guys we bring in typically have been captains at their universities,” Mangini said. “Sometimes when they come to a new place, they sit in the shadows until they find their way through and then it starts to come out. But we want them to lead in whatever capacity they feel comfortable doing it. Some guys that’s in the weight room, some guys it’s in the locker room and some guys it’s in the classroom. But we all have the capacity to help others become better.”At Texas, McCoy was at his best on the field. He went 45-8 as a four-year starter with the Longhorns, leaving as college football’s career leader in victories. This will be the first time McCoy has not started since redshirting his first year at Texas in 2005. Before that, he was a three-year starter in high school when his father was the coach.McCoy passed for 13,253 yards and 112 touchdowns at Texas, both university records. He was a finalist for the Heisman Trophy as a junior and a senior.The Browns delivered a playbook to him the morning after he was drafted. The size or complexity of it has not intimidated him.“It’s a little different with the terms, but a lot of the concepts, a lot of the routes, a lot of the protections are very similar,” he said. “Learning the language has been the biggest challenge. I’ve been studying it hard. I really feel confident in this camp.Mangini was pleased with how McCoy digested the information. He likes the work ethic McCoy developed by growing up on a farm, even if he has already grown tired of all the stories.“I could move down to Dallas now with the stuff I know about cattle raising,” Mangini, said jokingly. “He’s used to getting up early and working hard, two things I like. That’s good.”"
Willis Reed’s Hip and the Radio Daze of 1970 Knicks Fans,"Welcome, graying fans of the quote-unquote Old Knicks, to our 40th anniversary week, the celebration of our greatest and guiltiest sports pleasure. Four decades ago, while the city and country convulsed with war protests and violence, we were obsessed with the pursuit of New York’s first professional basketball championship.Payback is a teenager. Raise your hand if you now have one who makes you want to scream, “When was the last time you read or watched something other than sports?” (Communal answers: Harry Potter, a Facebook thread, a formulaic movie with the cast of “Superbad.”)But this week is as good as any to hum the tune of  “My Back Pages,” to embrace the spirit of youthful preoccupation. For on the very day helmeted construction workers beat on war protesters in the canyons of Manhattan’s financial district  — and just four days  after the shooting deaths of four Kent State University students by National Guardsmen  — all we, as hard-core Knicks fans, wanted to hear about was the condition of Willis Reed’s hip for Game 7.President Richard M. Nixon took to the airwaves on the night of May 8, 1970, to defend the movement of American troops into Cambodia and to promise that the incursion would shorten the Vietnam War. In New York, the speech brought small solace compared with the more concise declaration by the Knicks’ radio voice, Marv Albert, who told his considerable audience a few minutes after 7:30, “Here comes Willis!”Reed had torn a muscle in his right hip early in Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals against the Los Angeles Lakers — which was played at Madison Square Garden hours after the Kent State shootings. Without their center and captain, the Knicks rallied to win and take a 3-2 series lead. After sitting out Game 6, which the Lakers won to even the series, Reed made his famous solo and stiff-legged walk from the tunnel to join his teammates and jump center against Wilt Chamberlain, spreading immeasurable joy around the city.In the context of the week’s horrific news, how do we explain to our children that a basketball game meant so much? We don’t have to. They get it. With two wars being fought and unemployment at or near double digits, young and old settled in front of the television to watch multimillionaires pile on top of one another last fall after the Yankees won the World Series.Again and again, sports history repeats itself and all we learn from it is that each seminal event creates its own dimensional space and a viewing experience that is more futuristic than the last.This being the era of television entitlement, what today’s young fan would find unacceptable and utterly preposterous about 1970 is that there was no free network access to Game 7 in the home-team market. The Knicks’ 113-99 victory was tape-delayed in the New York City area, per an agreement that ABC had with the N.B.A.Hence, most of us only heard of Reed’s classic appearance and his two early jump shots that fueled the rout. I recently spoke to some old friends about that splendid Friday night. With one exception — a guy whose cousin lived on the East Side and had early cable — those memories all centered on a radio, like early 20th-century snapshots.In a living room with a father and a brother; in a basement with lights dimmed and a couple of carefully rolled marijuana joints; in a Chinese restaurant during a family dinner out with a transistor pressed to an ear. One poor sap was afraid to break a date with his girlfriend but escaped to the popcorn stand to press the attendant for a first-half score.I was a high school senior, nine days from my 18th birthday and too nervous to risk some infuriating family interruption. I went across the street to the grocery store, bought a bag of chips and a bottle of Royal Crown Cola and locked myself in my 1961 Mercury Comet  — purchased for me by my father the previous summer for $500 and parked in the lot of our Staten Island housing development.My tactical mistake was refusing to waste the little gas I had  — as usual  — in my tank. I didn’t start the engine and the battery died just before halftime. Fortunately, by that point, the Lakers had more or less expired, as well, trailing, 69-42.Much later that night, after Walt Frazier had taken the baton from Reed and fashioned one of the great title-clinching performances, 36 points and 19 assists, I settled in to watch the replay. Shorn of tension, the telecast was enjoyable. But given a chance to relive the night, I wouldn’t think of trading Albert’s vivid play-by-play for the ABC team of Chris Schenkel, Jack Twyman and Howard Cosell.Nor would I want 24-hour “SportsCenter” and talk radio providing Reed injury updates every 20 minutes for the 48 hours between Games 6 and 7. I wouldn’t want reporters tweeting sourced news bites from the Garden corridors. Less was more. Ignorance begat bliss. I would want that historic night to remain as it was: me in my car with Marv, except with a full tank of gas."
Clouds Part Long Enough for a Memorable Ride,"Louisville, Ky.On a day of evil weather, the sun finally came out for Todd Pletcher.The shadows of the Twin Spires actually edged onto the shimmering slop of Churchill Downs just before post time, from the slightest bit of sunshine after thunder and lightning early in the day.In that benign break in the weather Saturday, Pletcher finally won the Kentucky Derby after going 0 for 24 in the nine previous years, with Calvin Borel taking Super Saver home in what is Borel’s staked territory along the rail.The 136th Derby now belongs to Super Saver for all time, as much his as the 1973 Derby belongs to Secretariat, subject of a current feature film, and the 2009 Derby belongs to the improbable Mine That Bird.During the past week, as D. Wayne Lukas entertained the multitudes outside his barn, every time he wanted to talk about the vicissitudes of racing, his punch line usually was a muttered reference to Mine That Bird.As obscure as Bird was, he ranks up there with Big Red — Secretariat, that is — in the only category that really counts: 1 for 1. Every Derby is different, by definition, because the race is for 3-year-olds: no horse wins it twice. But jockeys and trainers and owners do accumulate a history.Borel has won three of the last four Derbys because he is relentless in seeking the short route, and maybe a bit lucky, too. He was riding a horse that had drawn the No. 4 post on Wednesday, whereas Lookin at Lucky drew No. 1, prompting a sardonic set to Bob Baffert’s face all week.The horse is a good horse, Baffert kept saying with a wave of his white mane, but the good horse was squeezed once, twice, coming out of the gate. No horse has won from the No. 1 slot since Ferdinand in 1986; after watching Garrett Gomez try to extricate himself in the goo, we were reminded that post position counts in this annual border stampede of 20 spirited thoroughbreds.Pletcher did not necessarily get lucky. He hired Calvin Borel, who resides in the upscale East End of Louisville and does business along the rail at Churchill Downs. Horses have short but glorious histories at the Derby, but humans have long and sometimes humbling journeys. Pletcher’s admirable résumé is now much more impressive, beyond the zillions of stakes races he has won.After having the expected favorite he trains, Eskendereya, drop out last Sunday because of swelling in his left front leg, Pletcher won his first Derby, still behind the four of Lukas, the three of Baffert and the two of Zito, but making him a member of the club.One nice part of Derby Day was that officials at Churchill Downs did not have to resort to all the candlepower in the rather hideous new light stanchions, which they have placed along the track in an attempt to save racing here in the emotional home of the sport.For a while, it seemed that they might have to resort to lights to get the Derby done, either at its 6:28 p.m. starting time or later, in case the foul weather persisted. Those fears were legitimate, after torrential rain and thunder and lightning whacked the area.Was nature finally stating its displeasure at humankind for making thoroughbreds race to the limits of their fragile ankles? Somebody was mad at somebody. The portents kept coming Friday evening — tornado deaths in Arkansas, tornado alerts in Atlanta, hail in Ohio, and tornado watches in counties close to Louisville.Saturday morning’s weather looked familiar to me. When my family lived in Louisville decades ago, I covered the occasional lethal tornado. Eighteen months after we moved away, the killer tornado of April 3, 1974, roared right up Brownsboro Road and blew down buildings a block from our old house.The organizers of the Derby took the unusual step Friday of holding a news conference to talk about the weather. The National Weather Service said the rain would begin in midmorning but let up for much of the afternoon. It turned out the predictions were right.A crowd of 155,804 fans, who had spent fortunes on tickets and gaudy hats, were able to watch the races without being blown clear across to Indiana. But some wind and rain persisted during the day, reviving the logical question: how does the weather affect the beautiful animals that everybody professes to love so much?“It hits their belly and face,” Baffert told The Associated Press. “They throw their head up, they lose interest and they get scared.”But the weather window opened near post time, with sunshine spreading over the track, and soon it landed on Pletcher’s rather stoic face.“It feels terrific,” Pletcher said, giving Borel credit for the ride out of the No. 4 position.  “We didn’t want to handcuff him with too many instructions. ‘Ride him like you own him.’ He’s an instinctive rider.”Pletcher and Borel will surely be back here on the next first Saturday in May, but Super Saver does not have to come back. Super Saver has had his one day in Louisville. He is Secretariat; he is Mine That Bird. This day of ominous weather will forever belong to him."
An Unlikely Thorn Keeps Jabbing at the Phillies,"PHILADELPHIA — The last time Rod Barajas stepped to the plate as a Philadelphia Phillie, he was instrumental in furthering the downfall of the 2007 Mets. He delivered a two-out, pinch-hit single that drove home the go-ahead run in the 14th inning of a 7-4 Phillies victory in St. Louis on Sept. 18 of that memorable month.Barajas never played in another game for the Phillies, and that last hit was only his 28th of the season. But despite the fact that the hit was so important, Phillies fans never really forgave him for batting just .230 in 48 games that season. They serenaded him with jeers that year and in the two seasons that followed, when he played here in interleague games as a member of the Toronto Blue Jays.“I guess they weren’t happy with me that year,” Barajas said with a smile last week as he recalled the 2007 season. “That’s O.K., I still enjoy playing there.”Indeed he does, as evidenced by his performance Friday night for the Mets, when he had two home runs, a double and three runs batted in. Mets fans were probably startled by his outburst in such a big game; even after it was over, he was batting just .227. But for Barajas, Friday night was almost predictable, a continuation of the gaudy statistics he put up here against the Phillies in 2008 and 2009.In six games against his old team at Citizens Bank Park in those two seasons, Barajas went 8 for 16 with 2 doubles, 4 homers and 10 runs batted in. It was actually the same number of homers and R.B.I. that he had in all of 2007 for the Phillies.Which is probably one more reason why Phillies fans are mad at him. The Mets-Phillies rivalry has become a rousing one, but Barajas seems to have one of his own, and he keeps coming out on the winning side.Consider this: When Barajas was with Toronto, the Blue Jays were 0-3 against the Phillies in games without him, but 6-0 when he played. One of those victories came on the strength of his tie-breaking home run in the ninth inning. And now he is the No. 1 catcher for the Mets, and he is busy hammering the Phillies some more.Barajas seems to enjoy these high-energy confrontations. On Wednesday, when he spoke about the coming weekend series, he said he was looking forward to his first taste of the Mets-Phillies rivalry as a Met.“Absolutely,” he said. “I got to see it from that side for a year, and now I’m on the other side of the fence. I remember how intense those games were, how involved the fans were and just the atmosphere. It was an amazing, electric series whenever they got together. I’m really looking forward to seeing it from this perspective.”Understandably, Barajas has fond memories from that remarkable September in 2007, when the Mets had a seven-game lead on Sept. 12 with 17 games to go and managed to finish behind Philadelphia.“It looked like we had no chance,” Barajas said. “Nobody talked about it, nobody mentioned it, nobody actually said, ‘Oh, this is impossible.’ But if you looked at the situation we were in, we had a lot of work to do. But it seemed like every time we looked at the scoreboard, the Mets were losing, and that gave us a chance.“In the last game of the year we looked up at the scoreboard and the Mets were down like, 7-0, in the first inning or something and we were like, ‘Hmmm, all we have to do is win now.’ And we pulled it off.”Barajas played in only five games during that stretch, the last of which was his superlative moment as a Phillie. With the score tied, 4-4, and two outs in the top of the 14th in St. Louis, the Phillies had Chase Utley at second base. Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa elected to walk Aaron Rowand and face Barajas, and Barajas foiled the plan by drilling a single to center that scored Utley with what proved to be the winning run.In his last statistical act for the Phillies, Barajas touched home plate after Jayson Werth followed with a triple. He did not catch in the bottom of the 14th, but he was on hand for the celebration afterward.After that victory, the Phillies were one and a half games behind the reeling Mets on their way to overtaking them.“It was an amazing, awesome, incredible feeling,” Barajas said.The question is whether he will ever get to feel that way as a Met. Friday night was a good start."
Henin Reaches Final in Stuttgart,"Justine Henin beat Shahar Peer, 6-3, 6-2, at the Porsche Grand Prix on Saturday in Stuttgart, Germany, advancing to her third final in five tournaments since coming out of retirement in January.In the second semifinal, Samantha Stosur beat the qualifier Anna Lapushchenkova, 7-5, 6-3.Peer received no presents on her 23rd birthday from Henin, a former world No. 1 who is looking for her first title of the year.“I made mistakes, but I was good enough today,” Henin said. “I just have to keep going and to be aggressive. When I am aggressive,  my game is so much better.”Henin was the runner-up in Brisbane and at the Australian Open in January, her first two tournaments after returning from 18 months in retirement.She finished with 28 winners, twice as many as Peer.A NADAL-FERRER  FINAL Rafael Nadal withstood a serious test from Ernests Gulbis before  wearing him down for a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 win in the semifinals of the Rome Masters. It was the first time in nine matches on clay this year that Nadal dropped a set.Nadal will try to win his fifth Rome title in six years when he meets David Ferrer in Sunday’s final. Ferrer beat a sluggish Fernando Verdasco, 7-5, 6-3, to advance to the first Masters Series final of his career."
A Slam Seems a Little Less Fanciful Than Usual,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The surprising spectacle of Tiger Woods’s missing the cut at the Quail Hollow Championship — shooting 79 on Friday by three-putting twice, four-putting once, hitting only two fairways, stringing together three straight bogeys and back-to-back doubles — showed how quickly things can change in golf.Back when Woods was still seemingly invincible, before all the unpleasantness that began about six months ago, many golf experts had already designated 2010 the year of Tiger Woods.The analysis was simple. In his prime at age 34, surgically repaired, strong and healthy and a decade after two of his greatest seasons, with the majors returning to courses that fit him like a tailored suit, Woods would be primed to win the Grand Slam in its purest form — all four major championships in the same year.Now, rather than the stars being aligned for Woods to run the table, they seem to be forming the outline of a crown around the head of his archrival, Phil Mickelson.Mickelson, 39,  cleared the first of the four hurdles with his win at the Masters last month. He is playing well and putting with confidence. (He is two shots off the lead at Quail Hollow after a 71 on Saturday).And with summer on the horizon, he is staring into the very bright possibility of attaining the unattained because, first of all, he is the only one with a chance to win all four this year.If that were the only thing in his favor, then this would be another fanciful notion in the season for such romance, just as talk of the Triple Crown is annually on the lips of those smitten by the Kentucky Derby winner. But there is more, actually, “a whole lotta more,” as the legendary and very unromantic Clubber Lang told Rocky Balboa before knocking him out early in “Rocky III.”There are the three remaining stops on the major championship road — Pebble Beach Golf Links in June, the Old Course at St. Andrews in July, Whistling Straits in Kohler, Wis., in August — all preordained as home sites for Woods before last November happened. They now look pretty friendly to Mickelson.Mickelson, of course, did not win the United States Open by 15 strokes at Pebble Beach in 2000. That mind-bending feat was accomplished by Woods. But Mickelson has had his moments there, three times winning the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, the last in 2007. He tied for 16th at the 2000 Open there, and has five runner-up finishes in the Open as an additional motivator, should any be necessary.He was asked last week if he had considered the possibility of the Grand Slam, and whether the golf courses suited his game.“Somewhat,” he said. “But for me, I finished second in the U.S. Open five times. It’s a tournament — it’s my national Open. Growing up here, that’s a special event for me. So rather than jump ahead to other events, I really want to give myself the best opportunity in the U.S. Open. I had a good chance last year. A couple of years I’ve had great chances and haven’t come through, and it’s the one event that I’d love to win.”Before jumping ahead to Mickelson’s track record at the British Open and at St. Andrews, it is worth noting that his expanded clichéd answer of “one at a time” may be a key to success.So far, no one — not Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Tom Watson or Woods — has been able to win the modern Grand Slam, which makes Bob Jones’s feat of winning the original Slam in 1930  — the British Amateur and Open and the United States Amateur and Open  — all the more impressive.Woods came the closest in 2000 when he won the United States Open, British Open and P.G.A. Championship after starting the year with a fifth-place finish at the Masters. In 2001, he won the Masters, to become the only man to hold all four major championship trophies at once.The Tiger Slam, as it became known, was an amazing feat. But it was not the Grand Slam.Each attempt has been swallowed in part by the compounding pressures. Even before the concept of the modern Slam was conceived by Palmer and the golf writer Bob Drum in 1960, only two golfers were able to win the Masters and United States Open in the same year — Craig Wood in 1941, and Hogan in 1951 and 1953 — when Hogan won the first three by adding the British Open, a feat that has not been repeated. Hogan did not play in the P.G.A. in 1953 because it conflicted on the schedule with the British Open.Since then, Palmer won the first two in 1960, as did Nicklaus in 1972 and Woods in 2002. None won the British Open. Palmer and Nicklaus finished second. Woods was two strokes behind the eventual winner Ernie Els after two rounds at Muirfield, but shot 81 in the third round amid a fierce wind and rainstorm, and wound up tied for 28th.Should Mickelson manage to prevail at Pebble Beach, he will then focus on St. Andrews, where his best finish is a tie for 11th in 2000. He would be armed with the first two majors and on a high like few since 1960, when Palmer — whose muscular, aggressive style Mickelson’s most resembles — went there for his first British Open.And after that? Whistling Straits is a wild card, a big, brawling, windswept links course on a lake that has hosted one previous major — the 2004 P.G.A., where Mickelson finished tied for sixth.Mickelson has his bona fides in order. Four times he has won four events in a year. He has finished all four majors 10 times, and in 2004 he was first at the Masters, second at the United States Open, third at the British Open and tied for sixth at the P.G.A.It is too early to count him out. He may just have a whole lotta more."
Length of Deal Highlights Howard&#8217;s Flaws,"From 2006 to 2009, Ryan Howard had 198 homers and 572 runs batted in for the Phillies. Both figures were the best in baseball over that period and rank among the best in history for a four-year stretch. Only five players have hit more home runs over four consecutive seasons, and only seven have driven in more runners.Last week, the Phillies agreed to pay Howard like one of the game’s greats, signing him to a five-year, $125 million contract extension. The deal gives him the second-highest annual salary in baseball, trailing only the contract of the Yankees’ Alex Rodriguez.Philadelphia fans erupted in joy that their beloved gentle giant would almost surely retire in a Phillies uniform. What they probably are not expecting, however, is that that retirement may come before the club is finished signing Howard’s paychecks.Despite those statistics, Howard is not part of the game’s elite. Although there is no doubting his power, his home run output is helped by his stadium. According to ESPN.com, 16 percent more home runs were hit in games played at Philadelphia’s Citizens Bank Park than in the Phillies’ road games from 2006 to 2009.Similarly, Howard’s mammoth R.B.I. totals stem from the on-base skills of the batters preceding him. Over the last four years, 1,993 men have been on base for him, the highest figure in baseball. During that time, the Kansas City Royals’ David DeJesus has driven in a similar percentage of runners, with 18.3 percent to Howard’s 18.8 percent. But because DeJesus hits leadoff for the lowly Royals, and Howard hits cleanup for the mighty Phillies, DeJesus’s R.B.I. totals pale in comparison.Howard does no such favors for the players hitting behind him. During his first two full seasons, he was usually followed in the Phillies’ lineup by the punchless Aaron Rowand, leading to a large number of intentional walks. But once the team began putting sluggers in the fifth slot — Pat Burrell in 2008, and a mix of Jayson Werth and Raul Ibanez in 2009 — Howard’s free passes plummeted, taking his on-base percentage with them. Over the last two years, Howard’s on-base percentage, .349, barely exceeds the .343 mark that a league-average hitter would have posted in Philadelphia.These caveats might not remove Howard from the discussion of baseball’s finest if, like his fellow first basemen Mark Teixeira and Albert Pujols, he made additional contributions in the field or on the basepaths. But his fielding is merely average, and calling him a runner would be generous. According to Baseball Prospectus, he has cost the Phillies 15 runs on the bases over the last four years, the ninth-worst total in the game.Because of these liabilities, Howard resides in the majors’ second tier — a star, but not a superstar. According to FanGraphs.com, the Phillies have won 19.2 more games with Howard since 2006 than they would have with a minimum-salary journeyman at his position. That makes him the 17th-most-valuable nonpitcher during that stretch, just below his positional peers Miguel Cabrera, Lance Berkman and Teixeira, and just above his teammate Jimmy Rollins. The site’s calculations show that a typical free agent expected to match Howard’s historical production would be paid $21.6 million a year. That suggests the Phillies are paying only a modest premium of $3.4 million annually to retain their hometown favorite.Howard’s new deal, however, does not begin this year, or even next year. It starts in 2012 and runs through 2016, when he will be 36. That is why most quantitatively minded writers have panned it as, to borrow a phrase from Internet discussion boards, an albatrocity. Howard’s game personifies what Bill James, the father of modern statistical analysis in baseball, once called “old player’s skills,” namely patience and power. By contrast, young players tend to excel in speed, fielding and making contact.Neither set of abilities is more valuable than the other. But they bode very differently for the futures of the players who possess them. Natural athletes like Carl Crawford or Hanley Ramirez can compensate for the inevitable loss of durability and bat and foot speed that comes with aging by improving their pitch recognition or bulking up in the weight room. But massive mashers like Howard or Prince Fielder cannot transform themselves into lithe leadoff men as the years go on and the strikeouts pile up.As a result, their stars tend to burn brightly but briefly. Howard’s list of most similar players on Baseball-Reference.com includes a number of cautionary tales, including Mo Vaughn, Travis Hafner, David Ortiz, Richie Sexson, Cecil Fielder and John Jaha of recent vintage, as well as throwbacks like Jim Gentile and Dick Stuart. None of them had a valuable season after age 33, and most flamed out well before that. It is no wonder that Dan Szymborski, a writer for ESPN.com who has developed a player-projection system called ZiPS, foresees Howard posting a .325 on-base percentage and .469 slugging percentage in the last year of his deal. That is not much better than what one would expect from Mike Jacobs, whom the Mets cut two weeks ago.Shortly after the deal was announced, Philadelphia’s general manager, Ruben Amaro Jr., said Howard “kind of set the market for himself.” When a general manager admits he has let players set their own market, it may be time to get into the market for a new general manager."
"Pitchers on the Farm, but Not for Long","In consecutive games last week involving the Class AA Reading Phillies, a starting pitcher allowed no hits. On Sunday, Reading’s Phillippe Aumont blanked Richmond for six innings. On Tuesday, Harrisburg’s Stephen Strasburg stifled Reading for five.Both pitchers are pivotal to the future of their organizations. Strasburg was the No. 1 overall draft pick last season by the Washington Nationals. Aumont was the centerpiece of the prospect package the Philadelphia Phillies received from Seattle in December for Cliff Lee.Bob Milacki, a former major league right-hander, was there for both the games. As the pitching coach for Reading, he is charged with helping Aumont, 21, make the transition back to starting after working in relief in the Mariners’ system last year. Aumont, a sinker specialist and a former first-round draft pick, is 6 feet 7 inches and 255 pounds.“He became a starter because he has so much potential and they wanted him to learn and develop his pitches, and the best way to do that is as a starter,” Milacki said. “Who knows, maybe he will be a back-end-of-the-bullpen guy down the road. But to me, he looks like a guy who can log 200 innings, with that build.”There is no question about Strasburg’s role. The Nationals envision him as a No. 1 starter for years to come, with a promotion to the majors expected by June. Milacki played with a pitcher who arrived with similar expectations: Ben McDonald.In 1989, the Baltimore Orioles used the first overall draft pick on McDonald, a right-hander from Louisiana State. What Strasburg is now, McDonald was then.“I thought Ben McDonald had a better breaking ball, but he has a better changeup,” Milacki said, comparing the pitchers. “I think velocity-wise and mechanics-wise, they’re pretty comparable. Ben was taller. But Ben could create good angles, and the ball just jumped out of his hand. He might have even thrown harder than Strasburg.”After a brief cameo as a reliever late that season, McDonald joined the Orioles’ rotation the next summer and immediately succeeded. He tossed a shutout in his first career start and fired three complete games that September.“When he came up to the big leagues in 1990, the second half of the season he was by far one of the best pitchers in the American League, with Roger Clemens and guys like that,” Milacki said. “Eight innings a start. He was just tremendous — a solid, impact pitcher. He was a No. 1 for us.”McDonald remained a top pitcher for a few seasons, but he endured three rotator-cuff operations and never pitched after turning 30. Injuries could hinder any pitcher, of course, but there are reasons to believe Strasburg will be different.McDonald logged 152 1/3 innings in his final year at Louisiana State, compared with 109 for Strasburg last season at San Diego State. The Nationals have been rigid about Strasburg’s workload, holding him to 5 innings or 85 pitches, whichever comes first, for Harrisburg.“We’d like to take him further, but we don’t want to yet,” Harrisburg Manager Randy Knorr said. “We’ve got a long time with him.”Strasburg is not the only Nationals pitching prospect on a fast track to the majors. On Thursday, they promoted closer Drew Storen to Class AAA Syracuse from Harrisburg.Storen, from Stanford, was taken 10th in last June’s draft and could complement a major league bullpen that has been stingy. Entering Saturday, the Nationals’ top two relievers, Tyler Clippard and Matt Capps, had combined to allow two earned runs in 31 1/3 innings.The best bullpen in the majors, however, belonged to the Detroit Tigers, whose relievers had a 2.23 earned run average. The group includes closer Jose Valverde (a savvy January signing by the Tigers for two years and $14 million) and setup man Joel Zumaya, who is healthy again and made an impression recently on Nolan Ryan, the Hall of Famer who runs the Texas Rangers.“That’s the best arm I’ve seen since I don’t know when,” Ryan told The Detroit Free Press during the Tigers’ series at Texas. “His fastball was electric.”The Tigers’ bullpen also includes the former Yankee Phil Coke, whose three victories through Friday matched the combined total of half of the pitchers who started on opening day in the American League. Zack Greinke, Shaun Marcum, Kevin Millwood and Jake Westbrook were still winless, and Scott Feldman, Ben Sheets and Justin Verlander had one victory apiece.Beyond Wins and LossesOf course, the victory is often a misleading indicator of pitching success. For evidence, look to Joe Saunders of the Los Angeles Angels. Saunders was 16-7 last season, but beyond the impressive record were statistics that all but screamed “regression to the mean.”Saunders’s strikeouts fell from the previous season, he gave up more hits and walks despite working fewer innings, and only Baltimore’s Jeremy Guthrie allowed more home runs in the American League. Allowing a lot of hits, walks and homers, without strikeout stuff, is an obvious recipe for trouble, and predictably, Saunders began this season 1-4. His 5.74 E.R.A.  is part of the reason the Angels entered the weekend as the only team in the A.L. West with an E.R.A. higher than the league average.The Oakland Athletics have led the division for much of the season, but there are signs of trouble. The left-hander Brett Anderson is expected to miss at least four weeks with a strained forearm muscle, and the right-hander Justin Duchscherer hurt his left hip in a start on Thursday. Catcher Kurt Suzuki has missed time with a sore left side.The other teams in the division are activating important players from the disabled list this weekend: Cliff Lee (abdominal muscle) made his first start for the Mariners on Friday, when second baseman Ian Kinsler (ankle) returned to the Texas Rangers."
U.S. Defender Has Clear View of World Cup,"LONDON — Jay DeMerit sat in the eye doctor’s office as a machine mapped the topography of his right cornea, the dome-shaped surface that covers the iris and pupil, and helps to focus vision. A digital printout resembled a weather map with its yellows and greens and dissipating reds.“My own Doppler radar,” DeMerit, a central defender with the United States soccer team, said with a laugh.In mid-September, a bacterial infection arose in DeMerit’s right eye like a sudden storm. Within 24 hours, 70 percent of the tissue in the cornea had essentially melted. He could barely see his fingers in front of his face. He worried that he might not be able to play in the World Cup. Or that he might have to retire from soccer altogether.“I was freaking out,” said DeMerit, who is the captain of  Watford in the League Championship, a tier below the English Premier League. “I realized, I’m not going to play ever unless I get this fixed. No way I could play with one eye.”Fortunately for him, he was a professional athlete in England’s most popular sport. Quickly, DeMerit found treatment here at one of the world’s leading eye hospitals and underwent a corneal transplant in mid-October that was performed by a renowned surgeon using the latest laser techniques.“I realize how lucky I am,” DeMerit, 30, said Thursday. “If I didn’t do what I do for a living, I never would have been able to see this doctor.”A more conventional corneal transplant might have kept him out of soccer for 18 months to 2 ½ years, said Dr. Julian Stevens, the surgeon who operated on DeMerit. Even standard laser surgery might have shelved him for four  to six months, leaving little time to prepare for the World Cup. Instead, DeMerit returned to play after a month and a half.“Jay’s position is that there are two types of guys — astronauts and astronomers who look at them,” Stevens said. “He wants to be the astronaut. He wants to play in the World Cup, not look at it with the other eye.”Even so, DeMerit came pretty close to missing the World Cup, Stevens said.DeMerit expects to be in central defense when the United States opens against England on June 12 in South Africa. He hopes that a strained abdominal muscle will be healed when training camp opens May 15.“It’s serendipity,” Stevens said. “The technology was there. Timing is everything with these things.”Last Sept. 14, DeMerit’s timing seemed awful. As Watford bused from London to a match in Plymouth, he felt an irritation in his right eye. A speck of dust had gotten beneath his contact lens, he thought. By the next morning, the eye was red and swollen.DeMerit visited a doctor and received some antibiotic eye drops but could not play Sept. 15. He sat on the bench in discomfort. By the time the match ended, he had to cup his hands over his eyes to shield them from the stadium lights. When Watford returned to London that night, DeMerit’s right eye was closed and weeping. Unable to drive, he stayed with a teammate.“There was so much pain; it felt like someone was pressing his thumb in my eye,” DeMerit said.The next morning, a white blotch covered his pupil. “It looked like I had been bitten by a zombie,” he said. Even the iris had changed color, to greenish blue from blue.He became alarmed and saw another doctor, who diagnosed a bacterial infection. DeMerit said he was instructed to put antibiotic drops into his eye every hour for the next 48 to 72 hours. For three days, he said he did not sleep. His vision was reduced to 20 percent in his right eye. The eye looked dead, he said, as if covered by frosted glass.A week or so later, DeMerit was referred to Stevens at Moorfields Eye Hospital, a pre-eminent treatment center. The diseased cornea was caused by a strain of Pseudomonas bacteria that is “essentially flesh-eating,” Stevens said. Even as it dies, it effectively explodes and releases enzymes that dissolve tissue.“You can’t get the tissue back once it’s been lost,” Stevens said. “All you can do is replace the tissue.”A donor cornea was provided by the North Carolina Eye Bank and was transplanted to DeMerit on Oct. 19. Bob Bradley, the United States coach, said he was initially concerned, “because that’s not something we deal with regularly.”A conventional graft, known as a full-thickness transplant, probably would have prevented DeMerit from playing soccer again, Stevens said.“There’s a permanent weakness; if you get a bump in the eye, it’s a disaster,” he said.Instead, Stevens performed a less-invasive graft, known as a partial-thickness or lamellar transplant. Extreme precision was required, given that DeMerit needed sufficient eyesight restored quickly so he could return to soccer.For the one-hour operation, Stevens spent nearly seven hours custom-programming a femtosecond laser, a high-speed instrument designed not to damage adjacent tissue. The incisions reached a depth of 70 microns, or about the thickness of eight cells.“You can’t go deeper than that; otherwise you perforate the cornea,” Stevens said. “If I perforated it at any point, that’s the end of Jay’s playing career. He’d need a full-thickness transplant then.”The graft was shaped like a top hat and set in place like a dovetail joint in woodworking to reduce the chances of its dislodging. Finally, Stevens anchored the transplant with a stitch that traced a starlike pattern around the outer edge of DeMerit’s cornea.In November, to correct the nearsightedness in his otherwise healthy left eye, DeMerit had Lasek surgery, which applies laser energy directly to the eye’s surface instead of cutting a thin flap as in Lasik surgery. Eventually, he will have the same procedure on his right eye.As the transplant healed, DeMerit performed exercises to retrain the eye, catching a nubby ball as it bounced off a wall and playing video games, sometimes while wearing a patch over his stronger eye. He resumed playing for Watford on Dec. 5 and early on found himself shielding his eye when he headed the ball. Soon, though, he resumed his usual fearless style of defending.The vision in his right eye has been restored to about 80 percent of its previous acuity. Even so, DeMerit has had to compensate for a slight distortion in depth perception  —  a retinal signaling phenomenon known as the Pulfrich effect  —  which is most noticeable during night games and when it snows.  “If I’m 15 yards away and somebody throws a ball into my feet, I can’t judge it as well as I used to,” DeMerit said. “But can I play and do my job 100 percent? Yes.”The stitch has been removed from his cornea. Last week, Stevens used a diamond scalpel to make a tiny incision to further reduce the astigmatism in the healing eye. DeMerit’s vision should soon improve to about 90 percent,  Stevens said, which he joked could put himself in an awkward situation.“If Jay knocks England out of the World Cup, I’ll probably have to go into hiding,” he said."
New Frontier as a Lacrosse Coach Goes West,"DENVER — Every Friday, the University of Denver lacrosse team gathers in a campus studio for a session of vinyasa yoga. To stay healthy and limber, the players twist their bodies into a series of poses like pigeon, downward dog and eagle.The Pioneers’ players are not the only ones exploring new positions. Bill Tierney, 58, made one of the most stunning and potentially influential moves in college lacrosse last summer by leaving Princeton after 22 years to coach at Denver.Tierney, who won 6 national titles and 14 Ivy League championships at Princeton, left for a job with what he said was a $30,000 cut in salary. He has not yet joined the team in its yoga sessions, but he is embracing a life and coaching style that is a bit more flexible.“People forget that coaches are like regular people,” said Tierney’s son Trevor, the team’s defensive assistant and de facto yoga instructor. “If you’ve been at a job for more than 20 years and been extremely successful, there may be a part of you that wants to try something new.”While Tierney has found himself open to new-age tweaks like his son’s yoga and visualization techniques, the Pioneers have won seven straight games by subscribing to his age-old Princeton formula of suffocating defense and judicious offense. No. 16 Denver (10-4) hosts No. 6 Loyola of Maryland (9-2) at Invesco Field on Sunday, with the winner earning an N.C.A.A. tournament bid.Tierney professes eternal love for his time at Princeton but said he had been re-energized by the novelty of offering scholarships (Princeton could not), a more flexible admissions office and the opportunity to help the game grow away from its traditional Eastern pockets. Under Tierney, the Tigers became one of the four dominant lacrosse programs in the country. Princeton, Syracuse, Johns Hopkins and Virginia have combined to win the last 18 national championships.With Tierney overhauling a team that went 7-8 last season, Denver appears to have potential as boundless as the mountainous horizon.“Can we win a national championship out here? Yes, we can,” Tierney said. “The excitement and newness of what we’re trying to do seems to be attracting kids.”Denver has such a bustling lacrosse scene that Inside Lacrosse named it the No. 1 lacrosse town in the country. There are robust and organized youth programs around the state, more than 60 high school programs, and popular indoor and outdoor professional teams.“It gave us a sense of legitimacy,” Bryan Perry, the coach at Cherry Creek High School for eight seasons, said of Tierney’s arrival. “Not to say there wasn’t before, but when you get a Hall of Fame guy, the John Wooden of lacrosse, you raise your eyebrows and say we’re at a different level now.”Tierney’s presence will probably not start a Western collegiate lacrosse boom. Denver and Air Force are the only two Division I men’s programs west of the Mississippi. Universities interested in adding men’s lacrosse have struggled because its large roster numbers hurt the gender equity mandated by the federal law known as Title IX.“No one is adding Division I lacrosse when they’re not equitable to begin with,” Virginia Coach Dom Starsia said.But Tierney can give the game a distinct imprint in a Western hub, which Starsia compared to “stepping on the moon and sticking the flagpole on the ground.”Tierney’s trip began almost by accident. He had been conferring with Denver’s athletic director, Peg Bradley-Doppes, about other candidates last summer, when she said to him, “What would it take to get you out here?”She knew that Trevor Tierney lived in the area and played professionally, and she pitched the interview as a free two-day visit. Then Bill Tierney saw the lacrosse stadium, heard the vision of the university to broaden its name recognition and student base, and felt the passion for the game in the area.“I tried to be cynical,” he said. “I tried to figure out that I wasn’t going to like the facility, the kids and what the school was all about. Every time I turned another corner, it was just another great person.”Bradley-Doppes said she stood on the porch outside her office overlooking the lacrosse stadium when she gave Tierney the hard sell. With the snow-capped mountains as a backdrop, she recalled saying to him, “Wouldn’t it be fun?”She said she thought Tierney took the job because “it wasn’t going to be easy, that he was building something on a national level that maybe the faint of heart would have backed away from.”Last year’s team struggled with off-the-field problems, with three players being dismissed for violating team rules. Tierney set up some baseline discipline standards that he said the team had followed well. Bradley-Doppes said she had been impressed with small changes like the players wearing jackets and ties on the road and Tierney’s banning flip-flops and hats at team breakfast.The coaching staff inherited a team with 8 or 9 midfielders and 17 long-stick players. Tierney said a team usually had 17 midfielders and 8 or 9 long sticks.Dillon Roy and Andrew Lay, players on the team from Denver, said Tierney’s presence had helped instill discipline on the field, too, and they lauded his teaching methods as simple, concise and effective.Trevor Tierney said lacrosse in Denver was “less pretentious” than back East, translating to players being willing to work harder.After a blowout loss at Syracuse and an overtime loss at Jacksonville to open the season, Tierney did not change much.“He’s more relaxed than it seems like he was at Princeton,” said Dave Metzbower, an assistant under Tierney at Princeton. “He definitely seems like he’s enjoying it. Even when he lost his first couple games early in the season, he didn’t seem to be uptight.”Tierney began the year talking about being more wide open on offense, but the tendencies he showed at Princeton have crept back. Denver is scoring less, winning one-goal games and making a run at the postseason. It all sounds familiar.But along the way, there have been new offensive sets brought in by the assistant Matt Brown and defensive philosophies from Trevor Tierney.“I became overly protective of the system,” Bill Tierney said, saying the words “the system” as if they were soaked in vinegar. “What it meant to play Princeton lacrosse. When I came out here, it was good for me.”And although he has not changed so much that he will be sweating on a yoga mat soon, Tierney has shown a nod to the local athletic culture.“My wife and I did buy bikes,” he said with a laugh.At 58, a long way from Princeton, Tierney is off to a smooth start on his new ride at Denver."
"In Defeat, Thunder Sounds a Warning","OKLAHOMA CITY — In a crowded corridor, two superstar tandems, representing two N.B.A. generations, crossed paths one last time, with hand clasps and half hugs and mutual admiration, and weary smiles all around.Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol, two pillars of a title-contending Los Angeles Lakers team, were on their way to the interview room Friday night, having finished off the Oklahoma City Thunder in a tough first-round series.Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, the Thunder’s young guns, were on their way out, having finally succumbed to the Lakers’ size and savvy.Bryant greeted Durant and Westbrook as an approving father would after a spirited battle on the driveway. He told them they were “a couple of bad” something-somethings, using a phrase that cannot be repeated here. He meant it as a compliment.“Glad we’re done with you guys,” Bryant said, sounding exhausted and a little exasperated.The Thunder gave the Lakers fits throughout their six-game series, earning respect and a national following. This was the Thunder’s playoff debut, and it served as a warning shot to the Western Conference elite.“It’s going to be an enjoyable matchup for the next several years,” Bryant said later. “We look forward to these type of challenges.”Bryant had that stern look about him Friday, as if he were almost annoyed at how long and how taxing the series had been. The Lakers open the second round Sunday against the Utah Jazz, with little time to recover and prepare. But they move on as a tougher defensive team, having been thoroughly tested by the eighth-seeded Thunder.Aside from a 24-point rout in Game 5, the series was tight. The Lakers won the other three games by 8 points, 3 points and 1 point. They did not clinch the series until the final half-second of Game 6, when Gasol tipped in Bryant’s miss for a 95-94 edge. Even then, Westbrook gave the Lakers one final scare, with a desperation 3-pointer that caught the rim at the buzzer.When it was over, the 18,342 people, nearly all of them clad in royal-blue Thunder T-shirts, rose for an ovation. Durant, the 21-year-old scoring champion, gathered his teammates at midcourt and told them it was time to start working for next season.No team has come so far, so fast in recent memory. The Thunder won 50 games, a 27-game improvement over last season, then pushed the defending champions to the limit.At times, the inexperience showed. Durant, hounded by Ron Artest, shot 5 for 23 from the field Friday, but still got to the foul line for 15 free throws. Westbrook, dogged by Bryant, went 7 for 20 in the finale.For the series, Durant averaged 25 points but shot just 35 percent from the field, well below his regular-season average (47.6 percent).“There are better games ahead of us,” Durant promised.But these are necessary lessons for a young team on the rise. Durant and Westbrook, the starting point guard, are just 21. Jeff Green, the starting power forward, is 23. The two oldest starters were center Nenad Krstic (26) and guard Thabo Sefolosha, who turns 26 on Sunday. The Thunder was the N.B.A.’s youngest team this season.Thirteen years ago, it was Bryant — 18 years old, skinny and unproven — who went through the playoff crucible, launching a series of air balls in a second-round loss to the Jazz. Even then, Bryant possessed a confidence and dynamism that would carry him through any momentary failure. The same qualities seem evident in Durant now.“When you’ve kind of been through battles and you don’t come out on top, I think it makes you more determined,” Bryant said. “I think ultimately it makes you more resilient, so that when you do get to the position where you’re a defending champion and you’re playing for something, you want it even more — because you understand what it feels like to fail.”So now it is Durant’s turn to absorb the hard lessons and convert them into something useful: a new move, a new shot, a few more muscles.“Kevin is a guy that gets better every time he steps on the court,” said Sam Presti, the Thunder’s general manager. “It’s going to make him better in the long run.”The Thunder could use some veterans and some big bodies and will have ample room to maneuver this summer. The team could have as much as $15 million in salary-cap room —enough to sign one star or a collection of high-quality role players. Through shrewd deal-making, the Thunder also has four draft picks: Nos. 21, 26, 32 and 51 over all. None of the team’s core players will be free agents (although Krstic has a player option).“We’re not satisfied with where we are,” Presti said. “We know we have a long way to go.”On Friday night, the Thunder was one box-out and one rebound away from forcing a Game 7 against the defending N.B.A. champions. Perhaps it is not such a long way to go."
Japanese Team Welcomes Back Nomo,"OKINAWA CITY, Japan —  Takeru Iwamura, the Hiroshima Carp’s No. 1 draft pick fresh out of high school, threw a spring training bullpen session before the watchful eyes of his team’s  guest pitching coach. With each stride off the mound, the red No. 16 on Iwamura’s back flashed in front of the former No. 16 standing behind him.In a scene thought impossible 15 years ago when he shockingly left Japan for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Hideo Nomo — the former No. 16 —  was standing on a field as a welcomed member of Japan’s baseball community.Iwamura was 3 years old when Nomo retired from the Kintetsu Buffaloes at the peak of his career so he could test his abilities in the United States. Iwamura’s generation knows Nomo only as a pitching legend, not as a rebel.That is  why Hiroshima Manager Kenji Nomura invited Nomo, who had 123 victories in Major League Baseball  and 201 for his combined career, to help the Carp.“Just the name Nomo has great meaning to our players,” Nomura said. “Of course, one of the things he can teach is his great specialty, the forkball. But he also has a grasp of things like controlling your emotions on the mound and reading the psychology of batters. We have a lot of young pitchers, and they’ve all responded really well to his being here.”Nomo, now 41, was not the first Japanese player in the majors, but he was the first to go of his own volition and in the prime of his career. Had he failed, hostilities over his departure were so deep that he probably would not have been welcomed back. Instead, he became a national hero and an international pioneer. The rules have been refined, and 40 players have since followed.Fifteen years ago Sunday, he made his debut  in Dodger blue with that red No. 16 on the front of his jersey. He gave up one hit and struck out seven in a five-inning, no-decision start at San Francisco. His whimsical delivery — raising his arms up to the heavens, twisting his body back while standing on his right leg,  then letting it all unravel as he hurled himself toward the plate — and startling ascendancy were just the kind of freshness American baseball needed in the ugly aftermath of its labor strife.It was the fulfillment of a longstanding, secret dream. Nomo had tasted overseas baseball as a member of Japan’s silver-medal-winning team at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, and had been intrigued by Roger Clemens’s training program. When Japanese players received a system of free agency in 1993, a possible route to Major League Baseball had been opened, but not until after 10 years of service. That meant Nomo would have to wait until his early 30s to pursue his American dream.But like all Japanese players who have not reached their free-agent years, Nomo met with Kintetsu’s management in mid-December 1994 to set his salary for the next season. Citing shoulder troubles that limited his starts and contributed to his worst season, Kintetsu offered a reduction to $1.3 million, Nomo’s first pay cut since turning professional in 1990. Nomo, Japan’s leader in wins and strikeouts every season from 1990 to 1993, countered with the unheard-of demand for a multiyear contract.Tempers erupted and the team president reportedly declared, “You are not the face of the organization.” Soon after, Nomo unleashed the only leverage he had, the discovery of a loophole in Japan’s baseball rules. By voluntarily retiring, he was free to sign overseas. After nearly a month more of bitter haggling with Kintetsu, Nomo was finally free to pursue a career in America. In February, he signed with the Dodgers for the league-minimum $109,000 and a $2 million signing bonus. That is a far cry from what accomplished pitchers in their prime can command when they come over today. The Boston Red Sox signed Daisuke Matsuzaka to a six-year, $52 million contract before the 2007 season after giving his Japanese team $51 million for his early release.Excitement built during Nomo’s first season, as his performance soon started coming around with his delivery. Winless in May, Nomo won all six June starts, striking out 10 or more batters three times and lowering his earned run average to 2.05 from 3.82 by the end of the month. He started the All-Star Game in July for the National League and was its rookie of the year in November. In a season that lost games to a lingering players strike, Nomo finished 13-6 with a 2.54 E.R.A. and 236 strikeouts, tops in baseball.During his 12 seasons in America, he experienced the ecstasy of throwing two no-hitters and the anguish of being released seven times, the final time from the Kansas City Royals in April 2008.But his success and unyielding determination to keep pitching in America, even when it meant signing a minor league deal, earned Nomo steadfast respect and popularity in his homeland. Nomura, the Carp manager and a former player himself, recalled when public sentiment was different.“Sure, I remember those who said: ‘What? He’s bolting for America?’ or ‘How can he just ditch Japanese baseball like that?’ but I always felt it was his career and his choice,” Nomura said.Nomo, who declined interview requests while in Hiroshima’s camp, clearly likes developing players. Since 2003, he has financially supported the Nomo Baseball Club, a team that competes in Japan’s industrial leagues, from which he was drafted in 1989. Nomo has no field-level involvement with the team.Five players have turned professional, including pitcher Kenta Suda, who was signed by the Seattle Mariners in 2007. Although Suda was released this spring after two seasons in the minor leagues, he represented a continuation of Nomo’s pioneering legacy. A Japanese player with no professional experience, Suda went directly to the United States. That is still a rare occurrence, but 15 years ago, Nomo started a trend many considered unthinkable at the time."
Red Bulls Earn a Rare Win in Washington,"Juan Pablo Angel had a goal and an assist and the Red Bulls improved on their best start in franchise history on Saturday by beating D.C.

The Red Bulls were 0-2-5 in their seven previous games there.D.C. United (0-5) is off to its worst start. It was winless in its first four games in 1996, Major League Soccer’s inaugural season, but rebounded to win the championship that year.Ibrahim beat defender Juan Manuel Pena to Dane Richards’s low cross to score in the 51st minute, side-footing a second effort past goalkeeper Troy Perkins. Angel started the sequence with a pass to Richards on the right.Nine minutes later, Angel reached Joel Lindpere’s long free kick and nodded it inside the left post.SHOWDOWN IN ENGLAND Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City set up a showdown Wednesday for a berth in next season’s Champions League after both won on Saturday to knock Aston Villa out of the race and leave Liverpool’s hopes of fourth place hanging by a thread in the English Premier League.Tottenham beat Bolton, 1-0, at White Hart Lane, and City came from behind at home to beat Aston Villa, 3-1.

Debating the Place of a Dog in the Hunt,"To the Sports Editor:Re “Bred to Seek Blood,” (April 26)John Hardzog rightly observes the seeming contradiction that greyhounds can be “calm, gentle dogs” and “efficient killers.” As far back as 6000 B.C., greyhounds were valued as hunters and companions. However, even thousands of years ago, some people deplored using greyhounds to prey upon other animals for sport. In A.D. 124, Arrian wrote “On Hunting Hares” and noted, “The true sportsman does not take out his dogs to destroy the hares, but for the sake of the course and the contest between the dogs and the hares, and is glad if the hare escapes.”Nowadays, this versatile breed has several alternatives to their hunting origins. Artificial lure coursing, where dogs pursue a plastic bag dragged across a field, is one. Greyhound racing, where dogs chase a mechanical rabbit around an oval track, is another. Life as a pet is perhaps the most humane alternative of all. Cynthia A. BraniganNew Hope, Pa.The writer is the author of “The Reign of the Greyhound: A Popular History of the Oldest Family of Dogs.”•To the Sports Editor:Having spent much of my life in the Midwest, where hunting is what people do, I learned and appreciated the fine qualities of a good hunting dog. These are areas where dogs are bred for intelligence and skill, where the Westminster dog show is considered a joke. Out in the fields, you appreciate what a beautiful hunting animal a dog is. You can see the excitement of the hunt and the pure joy in doing what it was meant to do. It is the classic predator-and-prey drama that plays itself out a million times a day. George AnadPortland, Ore.•To the Sports Editor:I was appalled when I read the article regarding the man who hunts coyotes with his greyhounds. What Hardzog is doing cannot be considered sport. If he lived in my state, I would be doing everything in my power to persuade the authorities to seize the greyhounds and find decent homes for them where they wouldn’t face serious injury or possible horrific death on a daily basis. Jan TurnerBloomington, Ind.Unequal PunishmentTo the Sports Editor:I compared the outcome in the cases of Michael Vick and Tiger Woods with Ben Roethlisberger’s, and the punishment in his case is less severe. It is so apparent that race was a factor in these cases. Only a suspension of six regular-season games, which can be reduced to four depending on good conduct. Roethlisberger can practice in training camp and play preseason football. Roethlisberger goes on with his professional career without missing a beat. When infidelity and dogs become more important than the sexual assault of women, there is a breakdown in our mainframe.Teresa FletcherNewport News, Va."
Recounting Sports History and Racing Against Time,"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — During Scott Lynn’s biweekly chemotherapy treatments, he would unfold his laptop and furiously type away — determined to bring closure to a nearly lifelong obsession before cancer got the best of him.Since Lynn was a teenager, he had been enamored with Thornridge High School’s 1971-72 Illinois state championship team — a squad led by the future N.B.A. star Quinn Buckner.Lynn was convinced those Thornridge Falcons formed one of the best-ever prep teams. So convinced that for most of his adult life, he tried to find a tape of the state championship game, to no avail. So convinced that before his diagnosis, he decided he would write a book.Colon cancer brought his obsession into sharp focus and resulted in “Thornridge: The Perfect Season in Black and White,” Lynn’s book on the championship team.“Truly I didn’t know if I had a deadline or not,” he said.Lynn has been the sports director at Portland’s KEX radio for more than 20 years, freelancing on the side as a commentator for regional sports television broadcasts.His journey started two years ago, when he was planning a trip home to Illinois to visit his ailing father.During the trip, he sat down for an  all-day interview with Thornridge Coach Ron Ferguson, going through all his scrapbooks. They went over each game of the perfect season, something Lynn would also do in the book.Over the course of the day, Lynn realized that the Thornridge legacy was about more than just basketball.“I just went in to do a ‘Boys of Summer’ type book,” Lynn said. “But as I started finding these players around the country, I found that there was an even better story there about the early days of integration.”In 1968, Buckner was part of the second class of minority students to attend Thornridge. So was Boyd Batts. Mike Bonczyk, Greg Rose and Ernie Dunn rounded out the starting lineup.Lynn recounts the story about how Batts caused a stir when he held the hand of a white cheerleader at a trophy presentation. Ferguson had to talk to the team about it afterward — one of many conversations about difficult issues the coach would have with his players.Batts wound up at Nevada-Las Vegas under Jerry Tarkanian. He played basketball overseas for a few years after that and has since worked in various jobs.Buckner became the most widely known of the Thornridge players, putting together a 10-year N.B.A. career that included a championship with the  Boston Celtics in 1984. He is now a broadcaster for the Indiana Pacers.Lynn, whose real name is Scott Betzelberger, was a senior playing at a rival high school that season. His team lost in the playoffs before it was to face Thornridge.He says his team could have defeated the Falcons, although a smile betrays the truth.Over the years, Lynn would often reminisce about the team, and he searched in vain for video of the championship game. He always thought someone should write a book about it.In 2008, he decided he was that person.When Lynn came home to Oregon after his summertime visit to Illinois and meeting with Ferguson, he began his research in earnest. He conducted interviews in between his radio spots for the morning and afternoon drive times.“Christmas 2008 was when I going to start to write,” he said. “And that was when I got hit with this pain.”Lynn was rushed to a hospital with severe stomach pain, and doctors quickly found the source: colon cancer had blocked his intestines.After emergency surgery, Lynn spent several weeks in recovery. Then came chemotherapy.Although his prognosis after surgery was encouraging, time was precious. Lynn wanted to finish the book, just in case.So he worked on it during his eight-hour chemotherapy sessions every other Monday, writing as the chemicals dripped into his veins. And then he wrote more while his body recovered from those sessions.And before he knew it, he was finished.“It was tough, but it really gave me a great thing to focus on, instead of what was happening to me,” he said. “All the other people sit in that room, just dealing with it the best they can. Some read, some sleep, some just sit. It is really depressing and sad. But I had a goal. I had to get my book done.”Lynn self-published his book, which is available through his  Web site Thornridgebook.com and major online booksellers.His cancer has not recurred since he wrote it. And he has heard from Thornridge fans all over the world. Ferguson, 78, called him in tears to tell him that he had heard from players he had not spoken to in decades.“I feel really good about this; it touched a lot of people,” Lynn said. “My son said to me, ‘Dad, you wrote a history book.’ I guess I did.”"
From Hardwood to the Diamond,"Ernie Johnson may be best known as a basketball guy, sandwiched between Kenny Smith and Charles Barkley in TNT’s studio coverage of the N.B.A. But he has always held baseball closest to his heart. Johnson’s  father, Ernie, pitched for the Milwaukee Braves clubs of the 1950s and was later a Braves play-by-play announcer for nearly four decades. E. J., as the younger Johnson is known, joined his father in the booth for four years in the 1990s. For the past three years, Johnson was TBS’s studio host for baseball. But this season, he will call 40 Atlanta Braves games as well as TBS’s Sunday games after the N.B.A. season. Johnson also does play by play for TNT’s golf coverage. STUART MILLERQ. Does having such a full lineup, with basketball, golf and baseball pose any concerns?A. I don’t think so, though you have to hope you don’t say, ‘The Bulls will have a good chance if Phil Mickelson has a good year.’Q. How does it feel to return to the baseball booth?A. I’ve always loved baseball. My dream was to be a baseball player. At the University of Georgia, I walked on as a freshman, but I was told to walk off as a sophomore. Calling games with my father in the 1990s rekindled that love in me — and it was indescribable having him as my partner. He’s 85 now, and when I broadcast the games this year, I’ll picture him and my mom in front of their set.Q. Did being the son of a ballplayer make it easier for you to deal with athletes?A. Watching my dad work taught me to always just be myself. And when you grow up hanging around the batting cage and Hank Aaron is asking how your Little League team is doing, it definitely makes it easier. You realize that everyone is just a human being and you don’t build a shrine to these guys.Still, when I was young, I got caught up in it a little bit. The first time I met Michael Jordan, it wasn’t even a one-on-one interview, mine was just one of three microphones there, but I was thinking to myself: Look at me. I’m talking to Michael Jordan.Now it’s different. Last year, I was talking to Joe Torre in the clubhouse before the N.L.C.S., and I was remembering my dad taking me with him when he went to visit Joe in the hospital back in the early 1960s when he was on the Braves. So it feels like a link to my past.Q. How will you adjust to the broadcast booth and working with several new sets of analysts, nationally for TBS and locally for the Braves?A. After 10 years with Charles and Kenny, I can handle anything. With those guys, you really have to hustle to get in some words, and then Charles still interrupts halfway through a sentence just to say, “You have a big forehead.”"
Tarnished YouTube Star Lands With the Titans,"NASHVILLE (AP) — LeGarrette Blount did not hear his name called during the N.F.L. draft. The Tennessee Titans are giving him his shot at the pros, believing Blount deserves a chance after punching an opponent last year.And he has a good chance at earning a roster spot.Chris Johnson is secure, but the Titans traded LenDale White a week ago. The only other back is Javon Ringer. Enter Blount, the former Oregon back who is best known for punching Boise State defensive end Byron Hout after a game Sept. 3.The incident cost Blount eight college games in 2009. But he said Friday that he knew he had to grow up and take responsibility.“What I did was going to come with severe punishment,” Blount said. “Everything that I did to erase that image and help myself as far as getting on an N.F.L. team, it helped me out a lot as far as getting where I am right now.”The Titans’ rookie group is filled with names like defensive end Derrick Morgan, the 16th pick over all; the Rhodes scholar Myron Rolle; and Southern California running back Stafon Johnson, who also went undrafted after his larynx was crushed last year in a weightlifting accident.But Blount has had fans arguing about his future after that punch to Hout’s jaw, which has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times on the Internet.Coach Jeff Fisher said the Titans did their research, and he spent hours on the phone last weekend talking to people about Blount. Fisher would not disclose who he got feedback from.“He’s paid his dues,” Fisher said. “We felt like he’s deserving of an opportunity and he understands the circumstances, the situation and he understands the fact he has an opportunity. He’s a good football player, and he’s been very pleasant to be around.”Blount originally was projected as a fifth- or sixth-round draft pick and rated as the 13th-best running back by NFLDraftScout.com. No team took a chance on drafting him, but he said up to five teams called trying to land his services. He and his family studied rosters and the number of running backs before agreeing Tennessee offered him his best opportunity.Tennessee traded White to Seattle during the fourth round of the draft. That opened up an immediate slot for a big back like the 6-foot, 241-pound Blount.“I know that they let go of LenDale White, and I’m another big running back to come in and fill that position with me and Chris Johnson in the backfield it’s kind of a change of pace running game,” Blount said. “It’s like DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart. Both of us can produce yardage and make big plays.”He ran for 1,002 yards and led the Pac-10 with 17 touchdowns during his first season at Oregon in 2008 after transferring from junior college where he ran for 2,292 yards and 18 touchdowns. He was timed at 4.59 seconds at his pro day, but he was suspended for eight games after the punch after the season opener.Blount revived what was left of his career at Oregon by following Coach Chip Kelly’s plan for him. He missed eight games but was reinstated in mid-November after meeting academic and behavior requirements. He also talked with a variety of people Kelly put him in touch with like the former N.F.L. coaches Tony Dungy and Jon Gruden about what he needed to do.Tennessee has had mixed experiences offering second chances.The Titans had to trade away cornerback Adam Jones in April 2008 after he served a one-year suspension from the N.F.L., but defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth had two Pro Bowl seasons after he stamped on Dallas center Andre Gurode’s face during a game in October 2006 — earning a five-game suspension from the N.F.L.Fisher said everyone understood the length of the leash in the N.F.L.“I wouldn’t say it’s any shorter,” Fisher said of Blount. “I don’t anticipate any problems from him I really don’t. We’ll treat him no different than anybody else. He stayed in shape. He’s got his weight down. He’s very willing. He really wants to make this football team, and he believes he can help us.”Blount said he knew he was being watched wherever he goes to see what he might do next. Stewart, a friend and another former Oregon running back he talks frequently with, has been encouraging him since that incident. Stewart’s biggest advice?“He continues to tell me, ‘Keep your head up and don’t forget this all can be taken away in a minute if you go out and do something stupid in the street or something you know is not called for or you don’t need to be doing,’ ” Blount said."
Packers’ Top Draft Pick Aims to Show He Wasn’t a Reach,"GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Bryan Bulaga did not really enjoy the run-up to the N.F.L. draft. He preferred playing football than being poked and prodded at the scouting combine and analyzed by so-called draft experts.Bulaga, the Green Bay Packers’ first-round pick, did not understand, for example, why some people were obsessing about the length of his arms.“I’ve never been in a situation in a football game where I have thought to myself after a play, ‘Gosh, I wish my arms were longer,’ ” said Bulaga, who played offensive tackle at Iowa.According to a predraft scouting report distributed by the Packers, Bulaga’s arms measured at 33 ¼ inches.That’s considered a few inches shorter than ideal for a left tackle, perhaps providing a reason why Bulaga fell on draft day and much to the Packers’ delight was still available with the No. 23 overall pick.Now that he has found his home in the N.F.L., Bulaga can joke about it. At one point Thursday, he looked down at his arms, smiled and shrugged.“I don’t know what you want me to say,” Bulaga said. “I can’t get them any longer.”Short arms or not, it is not a reach to say Bulaga is the Packers’ left tackle of the future.Because of the steady play of the veteran Chad Clifton, there has not been a major need at left tackle in Green Bay for a decade. Nor, for that matter, has there been much of a succession plan in place.Packers officials hope that changed when they drafted Bulaga. The team is giving every indication that it will begin grooming Bulaga to eventually take over for Clifton.Bulaga said he was willing to try other positions but made it clear that he considered himself a left tackle.“I’d like to play left tackle,” he said. “But obviously, there’s a lot of work that comes with it. You have to earn that, it’s not just given out.”Bulaga said he had been impressed watching Clifton play on television.“He’s played a lot of good football and he’s still playing good football,” Bulaga said. “I’m just hoping that I can learn as much as I can from him.”On the other hand — and some scouts thought Bulaga’s hands were too small, by the way — Bulaga wants to show the Packers he is worthy.“I’m going to determine if I’m on the field or not,” Bulaga said. “It’s as simple as that. If they don’t think I’m ready, then I won’t be out there. And if they do, if something happens where a guy goes down or I earn my way into a spot, then so be it.”Clifton, who has started 138 games for the Packers over the past 10 seasons, re-signed with the Packers as an unrestricted free agent after drawing interest from the Washington Redskins in the off-season.But Packers Coach Mike McCarthy has expressed concern about whether Clifton, who will turn 34 in June, can sustain his durability.Clifton missed four games because of an ankle injury last year, including both games against the division rival Minnesota Vikings . Beyond that, nagging injuries often kept him off the practice field in recent years.And going into the draft last week, there was no player on the Packers’ roster who seemed capable of eventually taking over for Clifton or even backing him up. Daryn Colledge struggled when asked to move to tackle from guard in the wake of Clifton’s injury; T. J. Lang fared slightly better, but still is seen as a right tackle or guard.That’s where Bulaga comes in.After playing some guard as a freshman and successfully moving to left tackle as a sophomore, Bulaga was highly regarded going into his junior season. But after playing in last year’s season opener, he missed three games with a viral infection that affected his thyroid.He returned to the field but raised some red flags when he struggled against two of the Big Ten’s best pass rushers: Brandon Graham of Michigan and O’Brien Schofield of Wisconsin.Bulaga became stronger as the season went on, and he says his illness no longer is an issue. In the Orange Bowl, he shut down Derrick Morgan of Georgia Tech, who was drafted No. 16 over all by the Tennessee Titans.Now Bulaga is in Green Bay and says he couldn’t be happier.“Playing at Iowa City, it was a smaller community,” Bulaga said. “People really cared about the football team. And I feel it’s the exact same way here, that the fans here really care about the organization and the players.”"
Worrisome Day for Yanks Starts With Vazquez,"Javier Vazquez’s next start is scheduled for the crucible of Fenway Park, where he may actually feel safer than in front of his home fans. Whether Vazquez actually pitches Friday night against the Red Sox will be determined in the coming days.That is one of a number of decisions the Yankees must make now that center fielder Curtis Granderson is going on the disabled list.A host of unsightly events played out in the Yankees’ 7-6 loss to the Chicago White Sox on Saturday afternoon at Yankee Stadium, where Vazquez imploded for the fourth time in five starts, Granderson strained his left groin muscle and their bullpen negated a furious comeback by surrendering the eventual winning run in the seventh inning.When Manager Joe Girardi came out to retrieve him to a round of boos, Vazquez was his sole concern. But then Granderson pulled up lame running from first base to third on a single in the Yankees’ four-run sixth, and Girardi immediately started wondering how much time he would miss.“He said he didn’t feel a pop, but it just kind of grabbed at him,” Girardi said of Granderson, who went to NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital for a magnetic resonance imaging test that revealed a Grade II strain. (Grade II is considered moderate.)“When I saw him pull up,” Girardi added, “my initial thought was he’s out for a while. That’s not anything you want to see.”The Yankees did not disclose a timetable for Granderson’s return. Usually, they would have replaced him on the roster with an outfielder from the minors. But by collecting all of nine outs, Vazquez put a strain on the bullpen. Sergio Mitre (three innings) and Alfredo Aceves (one and two-thirds) will be unavailable Sunday, which prompted the Yankees to recall a reliever, the right-hander Mark Melancon, instead.In Granderson’s absence, Brett Gardner will take over in center field, with Randy Winn and Marcus Thames set to platoon in left, hardly an ideal situation.Once the Yankees sort out their outfield plans, they will move on to Vazquez. His struggles are all the more stark considering the rest of the Yankees’ rotation is 11-1. The Yankees could take advantage on their day off Thursday to skip Vazquez’s turn in the rotation and have him smooth out the mechanical issues that have plagued him. That would mean Phil Hughes, C. C. Sabathia and A. J. Burnett would pitch next weekend against Boston.One month ago, when the sheen of Vazquez as their fourth starter was still new, the Yankees could not have conceived of such a possibility. But he has pitched poorly in four of five starts, and the crowd of 45,265, if it had any patience left, lost it in the fourth inning when he failed to retire any of the four batters he faced.“When you do bad, you expect to get booed, man,” Vazquez said. “That’s something that I’m clear of.”The White Sox began Saturday with the lowest batting average in the majors (.223), but they pounded Vazquez for five runs, seven hits and three home runs — two by Andruw Jones. Vazquez’s earned run average climbed to 9.78, the highest of any major league starter. He entered this season with a career 4.19 E.R.A. For him to reduce his 2010 E.R.A. to 4.19, he would need to pitch 30 2/3 consecutive  innings without an earned run.“It’s no fun,” said Vazquez, who also issued four walks and threw a wild pitch. “I’m not going through a good time right now.”The Yankees traded for Vazquez in December — and, by extension, assumed his $11.5 million salary — because they were expecting durability, a pitcher who had improved and matured since his ignominious first stint with them six years ago. In five starts, he has yet to pitch into the sixth inning. Since being shelled by Tampa Bay over five and two-thirds innings in his season debut, Vazquez has progressively pitched fewer innings.“Pretty much the same thing,” said catcher Jorge Posada, who started for the first time since Wednesday. “Just falling behind hitters. That’s about it, to tell you the truth.”Vazquez fell behind, two balls and no strikes, to 7 of his 19 batters, and ran 3-0 counts four times. He allowed single runs in each of the first three innings, then came undone in the fourth. A single by A. J. Pierzynski preceded a two-run blast by Mark Kotsay that landed in the second deck in right field. He walked the usually unwalkable Juan Pierre on four pitches, then gave up a bloop single to Omar Vizquel, his final batter.“I think anyone can if you pitch the way you’re capable of,”  Girardi said when asked whether Vazquez could regain the fans’ trust. “I go back to Damaso Marte. He was booed a lot last year, and I don’t think we win the World Series without him.”On a day when he allowed two inherited runners to score, on a go-ahead double in the seventh by Pierzynski that capped the scoring, Marte might not have been the most telling example. The Yankees had a relatively smooth April, but one day into May, turbulence has arrived. Their center fielder is lost. One of their starting pitchers continues to look lost. And they lost, too.“There’s no doubt about it, he’s scuffling, and we have to find a way to get him back on track,” Girardi said. “My concern is right now, is tomorrow and the next day and how we deal with some of the things we’re dealing with right now.”"
"End of Win Streak Hurts, and That’s a Promising Sign","PHILADELPHIA — The Mets’ clubhouse was nearly silent. Players sat glumly and stared at their lockers, or stood and answered questions about plays that were not made, balls that were not hit and pitches that missed the mark.The mood was somber,  but the gloominess seemed to express a resolve that was absent most of last season  as the losses kept mounting. The Mets had just won 8 straight games and 11 of their last 13, and they clearly enjoyed that  feeling.So after losing, 10-0, to the Phillies on Saturday as Roy Halladay tossed a three-hit shutout, the Mets acted as if the loss was not only an aberration, but also  unacceptable.For an hour after the game, there was not a smile to be seen.“We didn’t play good, and the results speak for themselves,” closer Francisco Rodriguez said. “Last year, when we lost a game, let’s say we’d get used to it. I don’t want to say we didn’t care. We did care, but it was like, ‘O.K., turn the page.’ Right now, we had some momentum going, and so don’t want this at all. That’s a good feeling to have.”Among the most annoyed Mets was Mike Pelfrey, Saturday’s starting pitcher, who extended his scoreless streak to 27 innings, only for it end when the Phillies  broke through with a run in the fourth inning. The run was quickly followed by five more in the inning. When the dam  cracked, the runs came in a torrent.The six runs in that inning were three times as many as he had allowed in his previous five starts. Pelfrey’s record fell to 4-1.Other annoyed Mets in the clubhouse were shortstop Jose Reyes and second baseman Alex Cora, who were each disappointed in their inability to catch a pair of balls in that decisive inning that might have prevented Pelfrey’s collapse.Also unhappy was David Wright, who doubled off Halladay in the fourth inning, but got into a heated argument with Ron Kulpa, the home-plate umpire, two innings later.“It’s just part of the game,” Wright said. “You have two guys that think they’re right, and that will obviously make for a little bit of a confrontation. But I have all the respect in the world not just for him but for all the umpires.”Wright was upset at one of the called strikes in that at-bat and eventually struck out, but it was not as if Halladay needed the help. He was sharp, especially with his changeup, but there was a sense going around the clubhouse that the Mets felt they could have gotten to him, at least a little bit.Although Halladay recorded his 17th career shutout and improved  to 5-1 while lowering his earned run average to 1.47, the Mets hit some balls hard. They also had a few runners on base early and forced him to throw a lot of pitches in the first few innings.But once the Phillies got those six runs, Halladay knew how to put the game away.“When you get a six-spot with a guy like Halladay on the mound, it’s pretty much ballgame,” said Jeff Francoeur, the Mets’ right fielder.The six-spot in question began rather quietly as Phillies second baseman Chase Utley hit a flare over the head of Reyes, who dived to attempt to make the catch and actually had the ball in the palm of his glove.But he dropped the ball before landing, and Utley had a single.“I have to make that play,” Reyes said. “You can’t give away any outs to those guys.”Ryan Howard followed with a single to right that sent Utley to second, and Jayson Werth hit a bloop to shallow center. Like Reyes before him, Cora had the ball in his glove for an instant, only to drop it.Utley was running to third before Cora dropped the ball, so if Cora had caught it, Utley probably would have been doubled off second. Instead, he scored the first run off Pelfrey in 22 days.“I turned around and saw Utley running, and I was like, Wow, that’s a double play right there,” Cora said. “But it happens.”Neither play was easy, and both were ruled hits, as they should have been. But both players knew they could have made the plays.“If it hits them in the glove, you’d like to see them catch it,” Mets Manager Jerry Manuel said. “But those are tough plays.”With runners at first and second, Pelfrey struck out Raul Ibanez, but the Phillies followed with four straight hits, including one by Halladay, with two outs. Shane Victorino then hit a three-run homer to right field on a pitch that was right over the plate and above the belt.The night before, Francoeur and Jason Bay made two fine catches at the wall to help starter Jon Niese. But a day later, the plays went the other way, and Pelfrey could not make the damage disappear.“A couple of plays didn’t go my way,” he said. “It happens. I’ve got to come back and get the next guy, and I didn’t do that.”And so the scoreless-innings streak and the winning streak ended, which made the Mets quiet and unhappy, at least for one day."
