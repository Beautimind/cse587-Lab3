Assumptions and Attitudes Don’t Survive Cancer,"MALIGNANT Medical Ethicists Confront Cancer.By Rebecca Dresser.272 pages. Oxford University Press. $29.95.MEMOIR OF A DEBULKED WOMAN Enduring Ovarian CancerBy Susan Gubar.288 pages. Norton. $24.95.Health care is supposed to move in only one direction, from horizontal to vertical, bed to door. The staunchly upright caretakers who wave the traffic along are not supposed to crumple backward into bed themselves, and when they do, no one is more surprised than they are.Doctors who become ill have written about the emotional whiplash of the experience so often that the “had I but known” theme has grown a little old. Two new books bring some welcome variation: Many other professionals spend their workdays focused on the body, and even those who don’t actually perform hands-on care may find precious assumptions demolished by serious illness.Ethicists are medicine’s theoreticians; some are primarily scholars, while others head right onto hospital wards as a combination of critic, coach and umpire. They come to know the terminology of illness and the perils of treatment very well, and because insoluble clinical problems are their daily fodder, they have rehearsed the standard “if this ever happens to me” scenario as often as anyone.Still, nothing prepares anyone for the horizontal experience, as seven medical ethicists discovered when they or a spouse received a diagnosis of cancer. They were so collectively shaken that they formed a discussion group, and then, like good academics, turned the proceedings into a book.Rebecca Dresser, editor of “Malignant,” is a professor of law and medical ethics at Washington University in St. Louis and a survivor of oral cancer. As an ethicist, she has a firm professional commitment to patient autonomy, the doctrine of “it’s your body and you alone decide what happens to it”. As a patient, she got herself into serious trouble wielding that autonomy: Unable to eat or drink, she firmly refused a feeding tube until she almost starved to death. Finally, her caretakers strong-armed her into changing her mind, and she eventually made a full and grateful recovery.As director of the bioethics program at the University of Wisconsin, Dr. Norman Fost regularly deplores our national pastime of wasteful and unnecessary medical testing. Yet as a patient, he writes, he has personally benefited enormously from just such testing, with not one, not two but three separate serious illnesses diagnosed with entirely unwarranted tests, leaving him with a bad case of what he calls “hypocrite’s guilt.”Dan Brock, the philosopher who directs the division of medical ethics at Harvard Medical School, learned he had prostate cancer at age 63, neither young enough nor old enough to simplify the many choices in the management of that disease. As an ethicist, Dr. Brock deplores old-style medical paternalism (the doctor orders, the patient obeys). As a patient, he was confused about treatment options, and none of his “good, nonpaternalistic doctors” pushed for any particular one. The resulting uncertainty was “the hardest part of the whole business,” he writes.It is hardly news that theory sometimes falls apart in practice, but the seven contributors to this volume reweave the threads of the ideal and the real into a set of earnest, readable reflections. One might be tempted to conclude that it represents a pinnacle of academic writing, were its well-mannered achievements not so roundly bested by the next book on the shelf.That is Susan Gubar’s staggering, searing “Memoir of a Debulked Woman.” Ms. Gubar may not be a health professional, but as a noted feminist critic (she is an author of the influential 1970s classic “Madwoman in the Attic”), she has certainly spent a career immersed in the meaning and functions of the female body. In one of those inexplicably savage medical ironies, she was felled in her early 60s by the worst of the “female” diseases: ovarian cancer. As is common, it had spread throughout her abdomen by the time of diagnosis.Cases like Ms. Gubar’s are usually first treated with the surgical removal of as much cancer as possible, along with all dispensable abdominal organs that are affected or at risk. This is the “debulking” of her title, and it is about as close to evisceration as civilians can experience. It became her focal metaphor for the experience of sudden dire illness, as all other interests drop away save “an overriding and offensive obsession with one’s own physical vulnerability.” On a less literary note, the procedure winds up bringing her almost more physical grief than the cancer itself.Ms. Gubar moves back and forth between poet and patient, with the occasional sidestep into academic mode as she reviews writing by women affected with similar illness. It is a difficult and potentially cringe-making project.But even the most skeptical and finicky reader — even the healthy reader, even the healthy male reader — will not put this book down. Some of its appeal comes from Ms. Gubar’s skill with textual analysis, and some from various appealing verbal shenanigans (has anyone else found and pondered the “mother” in chemotherapy, for instance?). Most gripping, though, is her frank, courageous account of life with a horrific postoperative infection in her large intestine that came to involve the buttock area.You don’t find infections like this one on slick, ultrasanitized “hospital” TV or in purported tell-all memoirs. You do, of course, find them in real life. Ms. Gubar deserves the highest admiration for her bravery and honesty as she bangs down yet one more door in her career — even if, sadly, it belongs to a place she had not wanted or intended to enter."
Spring&#8217;s False Start,"Q. After a late-winter warm spell that was followed by early-spring cold, I noticed that the trees in my neighborhood did not fully blossom. Even crab apple blossoms perished in the cold. What can we expect by summer?A. Plants are very resilient and should not suffer long-term damage from such weather patterns, said Mark Fisher, director of horticulture at Brooklyn Botanic Garden — though he added that if fruit-tree flowers die off, there will be a missing fruit crop.“It is not uncommon for us in a normal spring to have warm days followed by cool days,” he said. “A cold snap following warm weather will just slow things down.”One thing that could potentially cause long-term harm, Mr. Fisher said, is snow, which can break leafy branches and kill new growth.For that reason, he said, “our native trees are slower to leaf out — just to be on the safe side and protect themselves from this situation.”Another seasonal threat to the fruit crop, Mr. Fisher said, is that in rainy springs, when trees bloom in sustained wet conditions, “pollination is impacted, because bees and many other common pollinators don’t like the rain.”    C.

E.R. Doctors Face Quandary on Painkillers,"Dr. Bruce Lobitz, an attending physician in the emergency department at Upstate Carolina Medical Center in Gaffney, S.C., sees about 10 patients a week complaining of toothaches. “The bane of our existence,” he calls them.It’s not just that doctors like him lack the training and tools to solve their dental problems. Many of these patients, he fears, complain of tooth pain simply as a ruse to get prescriptions for narcotics.“Almost all dental patients request a prescription for narcotic pain pills,” Dr. Lobitz said. “ ‘I just need something to tide me over until I can see a dentist’ — that’s the classic line.” Sometimes, drug-seekers will show their cards: “They’ll say they’re allergic to everything except Vicodin.”Dental patients — mostly uninsured or indigent — are not unusual in emergency rooms. Poor patients may forgo preventive care and delay treatment until they face a medical crisis. In many states, adult dental benefits under Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor, have been scaled back or eliminated. And dentists often don’t accept Medicaid patients.But emergency physicians like Dr. Lobitz cannot know whether someone who claims to be in agony from dental issues is telling the truth — or simply plans, he said, to “go to the next emergency room, next town over, and get another 30 Vicodin.”Dr. Gail D’Onofrio, chairwoman of the emergency medicine department at Yale School of Medicine, has studied alcohol and drug abuse in emergency rooms. “The overuse of narcotics is a huge problem, and when a patient presents, especially for dental pain, it’s difficult to make an objective assessment,” she said. “It puts the physician in a difficult situation to assess whether or not someone truly needs pain medications. We err on the side of treating pain, and it is a huge potential for abuse.”The frequent prescription of narcotics in emergency departments for dental pain has been quantified for the first time by research financed by the National Institutes of Health, bringing to light another way opioids get into circulation and contribute to the rampant abuse of painkillers in the United States.From 1997 to 2007, painkillers were prescribed in three of four visits to the emergency department for dental complaints; roughly half of visits resulted in a prescription for antibiotics, according to a new analysis of the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey by Dr. Christopher Okunseri, a practicing dentist and an associate professor of public health at the Marquette University School of Dentistry in Milwaukee.Over that period, the number of painkiller prescriptions for dental patients in emergency departments rose 26 percent, and antibiotic prescriptions jumped 41 percent, according to the report, published online in January in the journal Medical Care.“E.D. doctors don’t have the training or expertise to provide definitive care, so the easy way out for them is medication,” Dr. Okunseri said. “If you’re not careful, you’ll create more addicts.”In interviews, many emergency department doctors acknowledged that they write plenty of prescriptions for opioids for patients complaining of dental pain, but they feel they face a conundrum. “I admit that some people get drugs out of me who shouldn’t get them,” said Dr. Tom Benzoni, an emergency physician who has worked for 18 years at Mercy Medical Center in Sioux City, Iowa.Yet some patients are genuinely in pain. “Do I deny them drugs so that one person doesn’t get a little more Vicodin?” he said. “It’s emptying the ocean with a teacup to try to address our societal drug problem.”Time pressures and heavy patient loads leave doctors with few choices. “If your goal is to get people out of the emergency room, it’s about stabilizing and shipping out,” said Dr. Nathaniel Katz, the director of the nonprofit Program on Opioid Risk Management at the Tufts Health Care Institute. “What’s the easiest way to get patients shipped out? Write them a prescription for Vicodin. How long does that take?”Dr. Katz, a neurologist and pain specialist, added that emergency department doctors lack the tools, like dental X-ray machines, to determine whether, for example, a tooth’s nerve is infected, an excruciating problem that often requires root canal or extraction.Relatively few emergency department workers are trained to give dental blocks, local anesthetic injections that offer immediate relief for 6 to 16 hours. In theory, the injections reduce the number of dental patients who leave the emergency room with potentially habit-forming narcotics.Dr. Rita K. Cydulka, the vice chairwoman of the emergency medicine department at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, offers dental blocks, but she said that others in her specialty don’t want to take the time. “They find it easier to write a script for antibiotics and painkillers, and send people on their way,” she said.Before writing a prescription, few emergency doctors use drug-monitoring programs to see whether patients have recently been given painkillers. Forty states have these programs and eight have enacted legislation to create them, said John Eadie, director of the Prescription Monitoring Program Center of Excellence at Brandeis University.“Unfortunately many emergency physicians don’t realize the importance of a quick check of the database to see how many painkiller prescriptions a patient has filled lately,” he said.During the first half of 2010, just one of 12 monitoring programs that reported to the Center for Excellence had 100 percent of prescribers registered to use their data. In the other states, the percentage of prescribers registered was only 9 percent to 39 percent, Mr. Eadie said.Some doctors say the many pressures they face create other incentives to quickly prescribe remedies for patients complaining of severe pain. For example, doctors are often rated by their hospitals with patient-satisfaction surveys for how they treat pain.“You can be faulted for not treating a patient’s pain — it’s considered the ‘fifth vital sign,’ ” said Dr. Abhi Mehrotra, the assistant director of the emergency medicine department at the University of North Carolina Hospitals. “We have to ask a patient’s pain, on a scale of 0 to 10, as well as document a reassessment of their pain after treatment.”Dr. Benzoni, who is routinely rated on patient satisfaction and sometimes asked by management to explain a bad review, said that he feels at times as if he faces a no-win choice. “If you’re going to criticize me for not giving out narcotics, and you never praise me for correctly identifying a drug-seeker,” he said, “then I’m going to give out narcotics.”"
Signs of Volcanoes In Mars Topography,"A new study suggests that the Athabasca Valles, a group of valleys near the Martian equator, were not formed by ice, as some scientists have theorized.Instead, high-resolution images of the valleys reveal more than 250 coiling spiral patterns that closely resemble lava flows on the Big Island of Hawaii. And that means the valleys on Mars were probably formed by volcanic activity, said Andrew J. Ryan, the planetary scientist at Arizona State University who discovered the coils.Mr. Ryan, a first-year doctoral student, reported the findings in the journal Science, along with his colleague Philip R. Christensen, also a planetary scientist at Arizona State.The Hawaiian coils were produced by a shearing effect, in which lava flows at different speeds and in different directions. It is likely that something similar happened on Mars, Mr. Ryan said.The coils may also have been formed through a spreading process like the one that produces oceanic crust. In that process, magma solidifies into a crust that slowly spreads outward, like two conveyor belts moving in opposite directions, Mr. Ryan said. A coil can form in the spreading center.Mr. Ryan said he suspected both volcanic processes had been at work on Mars, though he added, “In some areas shearing alone might have caused coil formation.”"
Abuse of Opiates Soars in Pregnant Women,"The fast-growing abuse of prescription drugs has reached maternity wards in hospitals across the country, with the number of pregnant women addicted to opiate drugs — and the number of babies born experiencing withdrawal symptoms — rising sharply over the last decade.A new study in The Journal of the American Medical Association has quantified the growth of the problem for the first time, as well as the increase in the costs of treating these newborns.The study estimated that every hour a baby is born in the United States with symptoms of withdrawal from opiates — roughly 13,500 babies a year. The condition, known as neonatal abstinence syndrome, can cause seizures, breathing problems, dehydration, difficulty feeding, tremors and irritability. Many infants are hospitalized for several weeks while doctors treat them with methadone or morphine to gradually wean them from their dependence on the drugs that their mothers used.“The incidence has gone crazy and I think it has the potential to become a national or international issue,” said Marie J. Hayes, a clinical neuroscientist at the University of Maine, and an author of an editorial accompanying the study. “People who previously might not have used heroin or the needle are more likely to use prescription opiates.”It is unclear whether babies exposed to opiates in the womb will experience long-term consequences. In the 1980s, there was alarm over whether babies born to cocaine-addicted mothers would suffer developmental problems or other damaging effects, but studies later showed that such problems were far from certain and much more likely if the child had to contend with economic hardship, family instability, poor education and other factors.The new study looked at two large databases that included a representative sample of patients from across the country and found that the number of pregnant mothers using opiate drugs jumped fivefold from 2000 to 2009. The number of infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome nearly tripled in the same period. The average cost of taking care of each infant climbed to $53,400 from $39,400, adjusted for inflation. Medicaid paid for more than three-quarters of the cases, since many of the women were low-income.“These babies require a tremendous amount of nursing care,” said Dr. Mark Hudak, chairman of pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Jacksonville and an author of new guidelines on neonatal abstinence syndrome issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics this year.Infants in the study spent an average of 16 days in the hospital, usually in neonatal intensive care units, which are especially expensive because of the specialized nursing care. Since 2000, the length of time infants spend in the hospital has not decreased, suggesting that doctors have not yet learned how to make treatment for withdrawal more efficient, said Dr. Stephen Patrick, an author of the study and a neonatologist in the University of Michigan Health System.“Are there other places in the hospital that can treat them?” like standard pediatric wards or outpatient clinics, Dr. Patrick asked. “Are there different medications or ways to treat them?”Dr. Hudak recommends trying to soothe babies first by cuddling them and placing them in darkened rooms. If that is unsuccessful, the newborns are given methadone, morphine or another drug related to what the baby was exposed to in utero; the drug is tapered off gradually until the baby is weaned. That process requires careful monitoring. “These drugs are very easy to overdose babies with,” Dr. Hudak said. “There have been deaths.” And if babies are weaned too soon, “they can wind up getting rehospitalized.”Still, despite the risks, studies suggest it is more effective to give the babies a drug related to what their mothers were taking, rather than just treating the symptoms of the babies’ withdrawal — seizures and breathing problems, for example, said Hendrée E. Jones, a Johns Hopkins University researcher in psychiatry and behavioral sciences.But the experts agreed that the best approach is to deal with women’s drug addictions before they are pregnant."
Simple Device Helps Delay Birth to Lift Babies’ Chances of Survival,"In wealthy countries, some very premature babies are saved in intensive care units. In poor countries, they often die or develop blindness, retardation, lung problems or cerebral palsy.Now a new study has found that in women at high risk of premature birth, a pessary — a small silicon collar placed around the neck of the cervix (as seen on ultrasound, above) — may delay birth until a newborn has a greater chance of survival.It also appears affordable, at least in middle-income countries, since pessaries cost less than $50 each and could be made cheaply if demand was greater. Placing one normally requires an ultrasound scan, but ultrasound machines are fairly common in hospitals and clinics in all but the poorest countries.The study, published in The Lancet last month, was the first randomized trial of pessaries for this purpose.Various pessary designs have been around for centuries, usually to prevent the uterus from prolapsing into the vagina or causing stress incontinence.For this trial, doctors at five Spanish hospitals divided in half a group of 385 women, all of whom had cervixes less than an inch long, which put them at high risk for early labor. Only 6 percent of the women who got pessaries give birth prematurely, compared with 27 percent of those who did not get them.Exactly why pessaries delay labor is unclear. In an editorial, The Lancet said the study raises the “novel and exciting possibility” that the load-bearing capacities of pelvic organs are important in pregnancy and starting labor."
"In Birds’ Pursuit of Love, New Plant Life Blooms","Male bowerbirds cultivate plants, a new study reports, though their gardening work appears to be unintentional.The birds, found in Australia and Papua New Guinea, are named for the extravagant structures they build to woo females. As part of their courting strategy, they decorate these bowers with fruits, and the seeds of these fruits germinate. This results in new plants of the species Solanum ellipticum, also known as the potato bush.“On average you find about 40 plants where bowers are,” eight times as many as at random sites, said Joah R. Madden, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Exeter in England.The findings appear in the journal Current Biology.The researchers found that the birds were not picking areas with high plant concentrations to build their bowers, since the plants began to appear after their arrival.“These plants are arriving after the bowerbirds,” Dr. Madden said. “In a sense the male is cultivating them.”It appears to be an excellent symbiotic relationship, he said. When the birds build their bowers, they clear the area around them, creating ideal growing conditions for the plants.“When we look around bowers, only 30 percent is covered with grass, shrubs, compared to random sites, where’s there about 50 percent,” Dr. Madden said.And male bowerbirds surrounded by more plants had more success with mating.Curiously, males seem to cultivate a duller, grayer version of the fruit; fruits grown farther from bowers were a more yellowish green.Dr. Madden isn’t sure why. “Presumably because that’s what the female wants,” he said."
Best-Case Scenario: Two Chances to Mate,"Male orb-web spiders have an unenviable lot. Most of the time, their mates eat them immediately after copulating. Even if that doesn’t happen, males can mate at most twice in one lifetime.Now, a study of mating behavior in one species of orb-web spiders has revealed interesting patterns of male monogamy.“Males mate with a female a second time if she is very heavy and a virgin,” said Klaas Welke, a behavioral biologist at the University of Hamburg in Germany who led the research. “This was quite important to them.”Mr. Welke, a doctoral student, and his colleagues report their findings in the journal Frontiers in Zoology.The researchers studied a species known as Argiope bruennichi that lives in Europe, from the Mediterranean up to Scandinavia. Eighty percent of the time, females are successful in cannibalizing their mate during his first copulation.“Heavy females lay more eggs, so you have opportunity to fertilize more eggs,” Mr. Welke said.During mating, a male’s pedipalp, the organ that transfers sperm, breaks off in the female and forms a plug. This prevents subsequent males from fertilizing eggs. Each male spider has two pedipalps, allowing him to mate twice in a lifetime.When a male mates with a virgin, he is able to secure 100 percent paternity of her eggs. If she is not a virgin, paternity decreases by as much as 90 percent.The study also found connections between time of day and monogamy.Males are more likely to mate twice with the same female early in the day, Mr. Welke said. Later in the day, they tend to search for a second female to mate with."
Life in the Sea Found Its Fate in a Paroxysm of Extinction,"It may never be as well known as the Cretaceous extinction, the one that killed off the dinosaurs. Yet the much earlier Permian extinction — 252 million years ago — was by far the most catastrophic of the planet’s five known paroxysms of species loss.No wonder it is called the Great Dying: Scientists calculate that about 95 percent of marine species, and an uncountable but probably comparable percentage of land species, went extinct in a geological heartbeat.The cause or causes of the Permian extinction remain a mystery. Among the hypotheses are a devastating asteroid strike, as in the Cretaceous extinction; a catastrophic volcanic eruption; and a welling-up of oxygen-depleted water from the depths of the oceans.Now, painstaking analyses of fossils from the period point to a different way to think about the problem. And at the same time, they are providing startling new clues to the behavior of modern marine life and its future.In two recent papers, scientists from Stanford and the University of California, Santa Cruz, adopted a cellular approach to what they called the “killing mechanism”: not what might have happened to the entire planet, but what happened within the cells of the animals to finish them off.Their study of nearly 50,000 marine invertebrate fossils in 8,900 collections from the Permian period has allowed them to peer into the inner workings of the ancient creatures, giving them the ability to describe precisely how some died while others lived.“Before, scientists were all over the map,” said one of the authors, Matthew E. Clapham, an earth scientist at Santa Cruz. “We thought maybe lots of things were going on.”Dr. Clapham and his co-author, Jonathan L. Payne, a Stanford geochemist, concluded that animals with skeletons or shells made of calcium carbonate, or limestone, were more likely to die than those with skeletons of other substances. And animals that had few ways of protecting their internal chemistry were more apt to disappear.Being widely dispersed across the planet was little protection against extinction, and neither was being numerous. The deaths happened throughout the ocean. Nor was there any correlation between extinction and how a creature moved or what it ate.Instead, the authors concluded, the animals died from a lack of dissolved oxygen in the water, an excess of carbon dioxide, a reduced ability to make shells from calcium carbonate, altered ocean acidity and higher water temperatures. They also concluded that all these stresses happened rapidly and that each one amplified the effects of the others.That led to a wholesale change in the ocean’s dominant animals within just 200,000 years, or perhaps much less, Dr. Clapham said.Among the hardest hit were corals; many types, including the horn-shaped bottom-dwellers known as rugose corals, disappeared altogether. Sea sponges were also devastated, along with the shelled creatures that commanded the Permian reefs and sea. Every single species of the once common trilobites, with their helmetlike front shells, vanished for good.No major group of marine invertebrates or protists, a group of mainly one-celled microorganisms, went unscathed. Instead, gastropods like snails and bivalves like clams and scallops became the dominant creatures after the Permian. And that shift led directly to the assemblage of life in today’s oceans. “Modern marine ecology is shaped by the extinction spasms of the past,” Dr. Clapham said.So what happened 252 million years ago to cause those physiological stresses in marine animals? Additional clues from carbon, calcium and nitrogen isotopes of the period, as well as from organic geochemistry, suggest a “perturbation of the global carbon cycle,” the scientists’ second paper concluded — a huge infusion of carbon into the atmosphere and the ocean.But neither an asteroid strike nor an upwelling of oxygen-deprived deep-ocean water would explain the selective pattern of death.Instead, the scientists suspect that the answer lies in the biggest volcanic event of the past 500 million years — the eruptions that formed the Siberian Traps, the stairlike hilly region in northern Russia. The eruptions sent catastrophic amounts of carbon gas into the atmosphere and, ultimately, the oceans; that led to long-term ocean acidification, ocean warming and vast areas of oxygen-poor ocean water.The surprise to Dr. Clapham was how closely the findings from the Great Dying matched today’s trends in ocean chemistry. High concentrations of carbon-based gases in the atmosphere are leading to warming, rapid acidification and low-oxygen dead zones in the oceans.The idea that changes in ocean chemistry, particularly acidification, could be a factor in a mass extinction is a relatively new idea, said Andrew H. Knoll, a Harvard geologist who wrote a seminal paper in 1996 exploring the consequences of a rapid increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere on the physiology of organisms.“In terms of the overall pattern of change, what we’re seeing now and what is predicted in the next two centuries is riding a parallel track to what we think happened in the past,” he said.Dr. Clapham noted that Permian and modern similarities are not exact. The Permian ocean was easier to acidify than today’s ocean because it had less deep-water calcium carbonate, which offsets the acid. But he said that corals are the most vulnerable creatures in the modern ocean for the same reason they were during the Permian extinction. They have little ability to govern their internal chemistry and they rely on calcium carbonate to build their reefs.Chris Langdon, a University of Miami biologist who is a pioneer in ocean acidification research, said corals are undoubtedly in danger across the globe.“Corals, I think, are going to take it on the chin,” he said.In a recent study, Dr. Langdon examined the effects of naturally high acidification on coral reefs in Papua New Guinea. They showed drastic declines in coral cover at acidity levels likely to be present in the ocean by the end of this century, especially among branching corals that shelter fish.Hans Pörtner, an animal ecophysiologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, said his work showed that a warmer ocean with less dissolved oxygen and greater acidity had an array of negative physiological effects on modern marine animals.The Permian extinction provides an archive of effects suggesting how modern marine creatures will fare as the carbon load in the atmosphere increases, he said.Like Dr. Clapham, he cautioned that the trends between the two periods were not exactly comparable. Back in the Permian, the planet had a single supercontinent, Pangea, and ocean currents were different.And he and Dr. Langdon noted that carbon was being injected into the atmosphere today far faster than during the Permian extinction. As Dr. Knoll put it, “Today, humans turn out to be every bit as good as volcanoes at putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.”"
An Underground Fossil Forest Offers Clues on Climate Change,"In the clammy depths of a southern Illinois coal mine lies the largest fossil forest ever discovered, at least 50 times as extensive as the previous contender.Scientists are exploring dripping passages by the light of headlamps, mapping out an ecosystem from 307 million years ago, just before the world’s first great forests were wiped out by global warming. This vast prehistoric landscape may shed new light on climate change today.Dating from the Pennsylvanian period of the Carboniferous era, the forest lies entombed in a series of eight active mines. They burrow through the rich seams of the Springfield Coal, a nationally important energy resource that underlies much of Illinois and two neighboring states and has been heavily mined for decades.Pushed downward over the ages by the crushing weight of rock layers higher up, the Springfield forest lies at varying depths, 250 to 800 feet underground. The researchers have only sampled it so far, in the vicinity of Galatia, Illinois, but they think it extends more than 100 miles in one direction; its width has not been ascertained. An earlier discovery by the same team, the Herrin Coal forest farther north in Illinois, is just two miles long.“Effectively you’ve got a lost world,” said Howard Falcon-Lang, a paleontologist at Royal Holloway, University of London, who has explored the site. “It’s the closest thing you’ll find to time travel,” he added.Curiously, the forest can be viewed only from below. The scientists crane their necks, illuminating the ceiling with miners’ helmet lamps. Hundreds of millions of years ago, trees and other plants grew atop thick peat that eventually compressed into coal; when that was excavated, the forest’s fossilized remains could be seen in the mine’s shale ceiling.“It’s a botanical Pompeii, buried in a geological instant,” said William A. DiMichele, a paleobiologist and curator of fossil plants at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and one of the forest’s discoverers. He believes it was gently entombed by floods that successively washed through a swamp.A river as wide as the Mississippi snaked through the fossil-forest landscape; its course is still clearly visible. As the climate grew drier with rising temperatures in the late Carboniferous period, rainfall became seasonal and pounded sediment out of the soil, filling the river with silt. This suffocated the forest as the river spilled over its banks.The flooding was incremental and gradual, hardly ruffling the fern leaves that it entombed in mud and that can be seen, down to the smallest frond, on the ceilings of the coal mines.Huge fossilized trees still stand rooted in their original but compacted soil, surrounded by the litter of leaves that once fluttered down.Primitive, lizardlike reptiles were then evolving in the swamps, but there are almost no animal fossils in the Springfield forest — save for the occasional cockroach wing — since such creatures easily fled the rising waters.Such snapshots of the very distant past — tens of millions of years before the age of dinosaurs — are hard to come by. “It is extraordinarily rare to get fossil forests of any extent at all,” said Kirk Johnson, a paleobotanist at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. “It’s usually just a few trees here and there. But here is an ancient geography — effectively unheard of.”Dr. DiMichele and colleagues have explored a five-mile path, or transect, starting at the ancient riverbank and arrowing through the swamp. Just as if this were a living forest, they have stopped along the route to identify individual leaves or study fallen trunks. Moving away from the river, a dense thicket of seed ferns gives way to tree ferns and low ground cover. Farther out, tree ferns are dwarfed by forest giants called scale trees.“It was a Dr. Seuss world,” Dr. Johnson said of the scale-tree forests: sun-washed quagmires studded with giant green stalks like asparagus spears, hundreds of feet tall. (Scale trees did not unfurl spreading crowns until the very end of their life cycle.) Dr. DiMichele has followed a fallen scale tree for 100 feet, before it disappeared behind coal not yet mined away. Six feet wide at the base, it was hardly any narrower at that great height.Scale trees had reptilian-looking, photosynthetic bark that coal miners sometimes mistake for dinosaur remains. Tube-shaped with spongy pulp inside, the trees snapped in two when storms ravaged the swamp. Immense, cylindrical roots kept stumps firmly upright, as seen in the mines.By coincidence, the earliest ancestor of these scale trees has just been discovered in a fossil forest in New York State. Repairs at Gilboa Dam, north of the Catskills, uncovered the floor of what may be the world’s oldest forest, scientists reported last month in the journal Nature. Dating from the Devonian Period, it is 78 million years older than the Springfield find, but the mapped remains are much smaller, covering about a third of an acre.There were no birds in the Pennsylvanian period, so insects flourished in the oxygen-rich air. Hiking through the Springfield forest would have meant dodging millipedes six feet long and dragonflies the size of crows.And yet the fossil leaves show much less chewing by insects than the vegetation in our modern backyards. Animals had barely evolved herbivory, the habit of eating live plants, and instead subsisted on putrefying remains in the fetid swamp.Two million years later — a geological eye blink — came vast extinctions of plants, wiping out many of the species found in the Springfield forest. The mighty scale trees all died off. Their modern relatives are quillworts, just six inches high.The reach of the Springfield forest should allow scientists to undertake ecosystem-wide analyses in a way never before possible in landscapes so ancient, and such studies may help them predict the effects of global warming today.“With our own CO2 rises and changes in climate,” said Scott D. Elrick, a team member from the Illinois State Geological Survey, “we can look at the past here and say, ‘It’s happened before.’ ”Today, we burn the scale trees of the Carboniferous by the billions: they have all turned to coal. Newly discovered, the Springfield forest is already crumbling to bits, as coal-mine ceilings quickly do after exposure. But with continued mining, more ceilings are being revealed every day.“You have to dig to find fossils, going inside the anatomy of the planet,” Dr. Johnson said. “Bill DiMichele realizes he has an entire industry digging for him, creating a tunnel into an ancient world.”"
Remember the Research (1 Letter),"To the Editor:Re “Cheney File Traces Heart Care Milestones” (April 24): I don’t begrudge former Vice President Dick Cheney’s access to the health care advances that have saved his life on more than one occasion, even if this access may be owing to his privileged economic and political status. I find it ironic, however, that Mr. Cheney benefited from “every procedure, technology and class of drug available” during a time when the Bush administration consistently vetoed or restricted increases to the National Institutes of Health budgets.N.I.H. funding is a critical source of support for research that has spawned the innovative procedures, devices and medications keeping the former vice president alive. One can only hope that Mr. Cheney’s new heart will provide him with the compassion and understanding to speak out for increased federal support for medical research.Gail A.

Backyard Treasures (1 Letter),"To the Editor:Re “So Much Life on a Little Patch of Earth” (April 24): I am reminded of “A Lot of Insects: Entomology in a Suburban Garden,” a delightful book by Frank Lutz, published in 1941.Mr. Lutz, who was curator of insects at the American Museum of Natural History and author of the much-beloved “Field Book of Insects,” used by two or three generations of amateurs in the Northeast, described how he set out to do a complete insect inventory of his homestead. He had guessed publicly that he could find 500 species. He ended up with 1,402 after four years of looking. But none of them was a first record for North America.Arthur M.

Time to Let Go (1 Letter),"To the Editor:Re “At Playground, Child Plus Lap Can Equal Danger” (Well, April 24): Tara Parker-Pope’s article serves as a warning to helicopter parents who are reluctant to “let go.” Letting your kids figure out how to go down a slide or pick themselves up after minor scrapes is such a vital skill. Why are some parents overprotecting their kids to the point where they are doing damage to their long-term physical and mental health?Parents who deprive their children of coping mechanisms are developing ticking time bombs of anxiety in the teenage years, or unpleasant brats in early adulthood. We all suffer as a society when parents are too clueless to let go, from guilt or fear or a desire for control. But most important, these children suffer by being imprisoned in a glass bubble and prevented from experiencing life.Gilbert GimmFairfax, Va."
Hollywood Ending? (1 Letter),"To the Editor:Re “In Pursuit of Riches, and Travelers’ Supplies, in the Asteroid Belt” (April 24): One option for Planetary Resources Inc. “is to nudge a small asteroid, perhaps one as long as a football field, into an orbit around Earth closer than the moon.”Nothing could possibly go wrong with that idea, could it? There’s no way that a miscalculation or equipment failure (or another near-Earth object) could accidentally nudge it close enough that Earth’s gravitational pull would eventually cause it to crash into the planet?Better put Bruce Willis on alert that he may have to reprise his role in “Armageddon,” only this time for real.Richard RothbardChestnut Ridge, N.Y."
California Chosen as Home for Computing Institute,"BERKELEY, Calif. — The Simons Foundation, which specializes in science and math research, has chosen the University of California, Berkeley, as host for an ambitious new center for computer science, the university plans to announce on Tuesday.The foundation’s $60 million grant to establish the center, to be called the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at U.C. Berkeley, underscores the growing influence of computer science on the physical and social sciences. An interdisciplinary array of scientists will explore the mathematical foundations of computer science and attack problems in fields as diverse as health care, astrophysics, genetics and economics.“We’ve been talking to astronomers, climate scientists, fluid mechanics people, quantum physicists and cognitive scientists,” said Richard M. Karp, a Berkeley computer scientist who will be the institute’s director.Part science and part engineering, computer science has long been viewed warily by scientists in other disciplines. But that is changing, not only because the computer has become the standard scientific instrument but also because “computational thinking” offers new ways to analyze the vast amounts of data now accessible to scientists. This new approach — what researchers call the “algorithmic” or “computational” lens — is transforming science in much the way the microscope and telescope did. When computer scientists train their sights on other disciplines, said Christos H. Papadimitriou, a Berkeley computer scientist who will help manage the institute, “truths come out that wouldn’t have come out otherwise.”Moreover, the flood of experimental results generated by inexpensive sensors, combined with the Internet’s ubiquitous connectivity, is threatening to drown scientists in vast data sets often called “big data.”“I do think there is this idea that big data is happening,” said Peter Norvig, Google’s director of research. “Now there is more acceptance pencil and paper alone won’t solve all of our problems.”Tuesday’s announcement is part of a broader trend toward expanding support for research in computational theory. The Rafik B. Hariri Institute for Computing and Computational Science and Engineering was created last fall at Boston University to turn a computational lens on an array of disciplines. (It is named for the former Lebanese prime minister who was assassinated in 2005; he was also a former trustee of the university.)“It’s analytics with big data, it’s the ability to compute and analyze in massive parallel architectures,” said Jeannette M. Wing, head of the computer science department at Carnegie Mellon University. “All the science and engineering disciplines realize this is part of the future.”Dr. Karp, the Simons Institute’s new director, cited the example of the Berkeley cosmologist Joshua Bloom, who has automated the process of identifying interesting events in the night sky. Each evening the system must choose from millions of options.“What should we track tomorrow?” Dr. Karp said. “There is a continually changing decision process. It’s an online computation process par excellence.”The institute will not be a scientific computing center, said Alistair Sinclair, a Berkeley computer scientist who will serve as its associate director. “An astronomer won’t come along with data and we all sit down and create algorithms to process his data,” he said. “It goes deeper than that. The astronomer will come and talk about the nature of his problems.”The institute will have about 70 visiting researchers at any one time, including faculty members, postdoctoral researchers and graduate students. It will begin operating later this year and be fully operational in 2013.The Simons Foundation, created by the hedge fund billionaire and philanthropist James H. Simons, has given hundreds of millions of dollars for research in autism, math and physical sciences, and life sciences — and, last year, $150 million from both the organization and its founders to Stony Brook University on Long Island.Dr. Simons, who earned his doctorate in mathematics at Berkeley, was chairman of the math department at Stony Brook before creating Renaissance Technologies, a private investment firm. Forbes magazine estimates his current worth at $10.6 billion."
U.S. Lags in Global Measure of Premature Births,"Fifteen million babies are born prematurely each year, and the United States fared badly in the first country-by-country global comparison of premature births, which was released Wednesday by the World Health Organization and other agencies.Although American hospitals excel at saving premature infants, the United States is similar to developing countries in the percentage of mothers who give birth before their children are due, the study’s chief author noted. It does worse than any Western European country and considerably worse than Japan or the Scandinavian countries.That stems from the unique American combination of many pregnant teenagers and many women older than 35 who are giving birth, sometimes to twins or triplets implanted after in vitro fertilization, the authors said. Twins and triplets are often deliberately delivered early by Caesarean section to avoid the unpredictable risks of vaginally delivering multiple full-term babies.Also, many American women of childbearing age have other risk factors for premature birth, like obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure or smoking habits. And the many women who lack health insurance often do not see doctors early in their pregnancies, when problems like high blood pressure or genital infections can be headed off.Experts do not know all the elements that can set off early labor.Seeing similar problems simultaneously in Africa and the United States “is really a tale of two planets,” said Dr. Joy Lawn, director of global policy for Save the Children and the report’s chief author.The report, three years in the making, is the first to compare premature birthrates in 184 countries. It was produced jointly by the W.H.O., Save the Children, the March of Dimes and the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, which has more than 400 member organizations. Other contributors include nearly 40 major American, European and United Nations health and foreign aid agencies and foundations.The report’s conclusions about the United States are similar to those in a 2009 report by the federal government, which found that high rates of premature birth are the main reason this country has infant mortality rates higher than those of other wealthy countries. Very poor countries have high rates of premature births for different reasons: women have many babies, adolescent girls become pregnant at even earlier ages, and infections that can prompt early labor are more common.Nine of the 11 countries in which 15 percent or more of all births are preterm are in Africa; the other two are Pakistan and Indonesia.The United States shares the 12 percent range with Kenya, Turkey, Thailand, East Timor and Honduras, meaning one in nine births is early. The rate in the United States has risen 30 percent since 1981.Most European countries, Canada and Australia are in the 7- to 9-percent range.While agreeing that the United States does poorly compared with Europe, Dr. Alan E. Guttmacher, director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, took issue with equating it to Africa.African data is shakier, said Dr. Guttmacher, who read a draft of the report. Also, he said, the report counts only premature births, not stillbirths. In this country, a fetus in danger is delivered early, a practice that raises the preterm birth count, while in much of Africa, the infant would die and not be counted.Premature infants are, of course, much more likely to die in poor countries.In the United States, an infant born before 28 weeks has a 90 percent chance of surviving, though often with disabilities, while in most of Africa such a child has a 90 percent chance of dying, according to the report.(The report defines full-term as 39 weeks; other authorities use 37 to 40 weeks.)After pneumonia, complications of premature birth are the second-highest cause of death in infants, the report said. More than 60 percent of the 1.1 million babies who die of such birth complications every year are in Africa or South Asia.Many could be easily and cheaply saved, the report said.Steroid injections for mothers in early labor, which help develop immature fetal lungs and cost only $1, could save almost 400,000 lives a year.Teaching “kangaroo care” — wrapping the baby against the mother’s chest to keep it warm and promote breast-feeding — could save an additional 450,000.Wiping first-aid cream on the stump of the umbilical cord and having antibiotics on hand to fight pneumonia would save more lives, the report said.The report took years to produce because there is no global database, Dr. Lawn said, and many countries measure pregnancies differently — by the baby’s weight or the mother’s last period, for example.The spread of ultrasound machines has made measurement more accurate, she said.Because the triggers for premature labor are not fully understood, the poor performance by the United States is partly a mystery, Dr. Guttmacher said. “This underscores the need for more research,” he said.In his study of 2,100 Mexican-Americans and immigrants from Mexico, Dr. Radek K. Bukowski, an expert on preterm birth at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, found that the longer a woman lived in this country, the greater her chances of giving birth prematurely. The risk was 4 percent for recent immigrants, 7 percent for those living here less than a decade and 10 percent for citizens.Even after controlling for risk factors like age, poverty, smoking, obesity and diabetes, “we really don’t have an explanation for what’s behind it,” Dr. Bukowski said. “But whatever it is, it’s not genetic. It’s something they acquire here.”And Dr. Gordon C. S. Smith, an expert in the same field at the University of Cambridge, noted that his native Scotland had many of the same risk factors as the United States — teenage pregnancies, poverty, obesity and older mothers — and yet had much lower rates.“If somebody had a simple explanation of why the U.K. and Europe do much better, I wouldn’t believe them,” Dr. Smith said. “The reality is, for most preterm births, we just don’t understand the cause.”The report singled out some countries for reducing their rates of premature birth. Croatia, Ecuador and Estonia improved rapidly, Dr. Lawn said. Croatia was easy to explain: a war ended. The other two countries became wealthier and used some of that wealth to saving babies’ lives.The report also praised Turkey and Sri Lanka for cutting their rates rapidly. Sri Lanka made sure pregnant women were visited frequently by trained midwives. Turkey even paid rural women to go to hospitals to give birth and created “maternity homes” where they waited out their pregnancies’ final days."
"Island's Genetic Quirk: Dark Skin, Blond Hair","In the Solomon Islands, about 10 percent of the dark-skinned indigenous people have strikingly blond hair. Some islanders theorize that the coloring could be a result of excess sun exposure, or a diet rich in fish. Another explanation is that the blondness was inherited from distant ancestors — European traders and explorers who came to the islands.But that’s not the case, researchers now report. The gene variant responsible for blond hair in the islanders is distinctly different from the gene that causes blond hair in Europeans.“For me it breaks down any kind of simple notions you might have about race,” said Carlos Bustamante, a geneticist at Stanford University. “Humans are beautifully diverse, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.”Dr. Bustamante and his colleagues published their findings in the current issue of the journal Science.The researcher analyzed saliva samples from more than 1,000 islanders, looking closely at a subset of the samples — from 43 blond and 42 dark-haired islanders.They were soon able to identify the single gene responsible for the variance in hair color. Called TYRP1, the gene is known to influence pigmentation in humans.The researchers also found that the variant of TYRP1 that causes blond hair in Solomon Islanders is absent in Europeans’ genomes.“Here you go into an unstudied population with a small sample size and you can really find some cool things,” Dr. Bustamante said. “So what about other places, like what about light pigmentation in parts of Africa? How do we not know the genetic basis of skin and hair pigmentations across the globe?”He and his team hope to raise more money to further analyze the Solomon Islands data."
"'Ome,' the Sound of the Scientific Universe Expanding","The age of “omes” is here. It began with the genome, continued with the proteome, branched out with the memome and reached full flowering with the notion of the omome.This probably sounds like raw material for nonsense poetry, but it’s a real biological and linguistic trend that makes sense, once you get the idea of just what an “ome” is.The genome is the place to start. It is the totality of all the genes, whether in an organism or in something else, like a tumor. The human genome, mapped out about a decade ago, includes all the genes that make a human being.Creating a map of the whole genome was a monumental achievement, and during work on that project and after its completion, the omification of science took off. Joshua Lederberg, a geneticist and Nobel laureate who died in 2008, and Alexa T. McCray, now an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, saw it coming, and talked about the origin of the suffix “ome” in a 2001 essay, “ ’Ome Sweet ’Omics — A Genealogical Treasury of Words,” in The Scientist.The word “genome” was first used in 1920, by Hans Winkler, a German scientist, to mean all the material on the chromosomes in a sperm or egg, but did not become really popular until the end of the last century, when genome mapping began. Various experts had differing ideas on where the suffix came from, but it seems to be one that was made up. In any case, it clearly meant the totality of something. Dr. Lederberg, who coined a few scientific terms himself, contributed “microbiome” — all the microbes that live in and on humans — to the growing trend.An epidemic of neologia ensued. Thus were born the proteome and the secretome and the glycome, and numerous other omes that are pretty much impossible to keep track of. Interactome. Regulome. Connectome. Epigenome. The list goes on. In fact, it goes on for about 18 pages if you go to the Omics.org site and print out its list of omes and omics.The list could be said to be the omome, the ome of all the omes, a word which, in a moment of indulgent fantasy, I thought perhaps I had invented. Apparently not. “Omome,” or “omeome,” is on the Omics.org list, although the Web site given as a source led nowhere. Another possible inventor is Martin Krzywinski, a scientist at the Genome Sciences Center in Vancouver, British Columbia. He has created some extraordinary visual representations of genomes, and also invents new words. Among the coinings he offers on his site are “omome,” “omeomics,” “omicsophy,” which I don’t think will ever take off, and, just Thursday, “metaomomics,” which I don’t even want to think about.I loved the idea of the omome, but I thought it needed a reality check. I called Mark Gerstein at Yale. His lab is deeply involved in bioinformatics, the use of computing to make sense of the vast amounts of information produced in pursuit of the various omes. Dr. Gerstein also has an interest in the way scientific terminology develops.The omome, he said, was a fun idea, but he doubted anyone was making a living in omomics. Despite the humor in speculative omification, he said, the proliferation of real omic disciplines marked the spread of a “very important scientific idea.” He said, “All the omes derive to some extent from the genome,” and key to all of them is that an ome represents “the entirety of the thing being studied.”The mapping of genomes, he said, inspired scientists to use the same approach in studying proteins, metabolites and their biochemical connections, to name a few. And as they pursued this “omic idea,” the focus of biological research shifted in the direction of studying complete systems and networks, rather than individual parts, discrete genes or proteins.His comments reminded me of a recent conversation I had when I was reporting on the evolution of polar bears. One scientist wanted to make it clear to me that she was studying genomics, whereas another researcher was studying only genes. Only genes, I thought? What a difference an ome can make."

Scientist Sentenced in French Terror Case,"PARIS — A Paris court on Friday sentenced a French-Algerian particle physicist to five years in prison, one of them suspended, on the charge of “criminal association with the intent to prepare terrorist acts,” ruling that the man’s online correspondence in 2009 with a presumed member of Al Qaeda constituted a criminal act.The scientist, Adlène Hicheur, 35, did not deny the exchange of messages, in which he suggested targets for terrorist strikes in France, but maintains that he never intended to act on his words. The trial has raised difficult questions about the possible excesses of French antiterrorism law, which in effect treats intent as a criminal act.A researcher at the Large Hadron Collider project at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in Switzerland, Dr. Hicheur met his interlocutor on an Internet forum dedicated to radical Islam while on sick leave, nursing a herniated disk at his parents’ home in southeastern France.Dr. Hicheur has been in prison since his arrest 2 1/2 years ago; that period will be counted as time served, his lawyer said Friday, adding that they would decide in coming days whether to appeal the verdict.Judicial authorities say French law allows them to intervene while apparent terrorist plots remain in the planning stages. Dr. Hicheur’s supporters, by contrast, contend that the legislation oversteps the bounds of civil rights, that matters of pure intent should not reach the courts, which they call ill suited to plumb the vagaries of the human psyche.Dr. Hicheur, it has been widely noted, never acted on his words — he purchased no weapons and offered no direct assistance.“This decision seems to me to constitute a veritable judicial scandal,” said Dr. Hicheur’s lawyer, Patrick Baudouin, after Friday’s verdict. “It’s in light of simple words exchanged that Adlène Hicheur finds himself condemned to this sentence,” Mr. Baudouin said, without the “slightest beginning of a start” to terrorist acts.Over three decades, hundreds of people have been convicted and jailed on charges of “criminal association,” though Dr. Hicheur’s appears to be the first conviction based solely on Internet activity, Mr. Baudouin said.Dr. Hicheur was born in Algeria and has been described as an observant Muslim who integrated in French society but was angered by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He was employed by the Laboratory for High Energy Physics at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, with an office at CERN, where he was involved in work on antimatter, in an effort to explain why the universe is made of matter and not its opposite. Colleagues viewed him as a talented researcher.James Gillies, a spokesman for CERN, said in an e-mail that the laboratory did not interfere in the affairs of its member nations, but that “CERN remains committed to its policy of inclusion.”In 2009, Dr. Hicheur exchanged about three dozen messages, some of them encrypted, with a man French officials have identified as Mustapha Debchi, a representative in Algeria of Al Qaeda’s regional affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Dr. Hicheur maintains that he never knew the man’s identity, as the messages were exchanged via online pseudonyms, he under the name “Abou Doujana,” the other man under the name “Phenixshadow.”In a message in June 2009, the man inquired: “Are you disposed to work in an operative unit in France?”“Yes, of course,” Dr. Hicheur replied, though he repeatedly hedged, never committing to any specific plan, according to Mr. Baudouin.During a two-day trial in March, Dr. Hicheur acknowledged that while his e-mail correspondence might appear troubling, it was the fruit of intellectual curiosity and not the aspirational writings of a budding jihadi. He was on morphine at the time, and passing through a “turbulent patch,” he told the court, according to news reports.“I can understand that certain passages might cause worry,” he said, though he never explicitly repudiated their content.Dr. Hicheur’s brother Halim, a physiology researcher in Grenoble, France, criticized the case. He said “All this has been scandalous and outrageous from the beginning to the end.”Asked whether Dr. Hicheur would try to resume his physics career, his brother Halim said he did not know, but doubted that it was a realistic prospect in France.The directors of France’s national police and domestic intelligence agency accuse the physicist of planning an attack at the base of a French Alpine infantry battalion that has been deployed in Afghanistan.“The target was chosen — we had to intervene,” the police director, Frédéric Péchenard, told the newspaper Le Monde shortly after Dr. Hicheur’s arrest.In a sharply worded column in Le Monde earlier in the week, several of Dr. Hicheur’s supporters, including his former doctoral adviser, contested that assertion, and denounced the trial as absurd.“With a bit of perseverance, soon we will realize that the most harmless virtual forums are filled with unpunished criminal intentions,” they wrote mockingly.Defending the legitimacy of the case in a 2011 letter to a support committee for Dr. Hicheur, a top Justice Ministry official insisted that France’s antiterrorism legislation strikes the “necessary balance” between “the procedural guarantees of a State of Law” and the “imperatives of protection for its citizens.”Charges of “criminal association,” first defined in legislation dating from 1986, are central to the functioning of French antiterrorism efforts, judicial authorities say.“It’s a redoubtable tool,” said the antiterrorism magistrate Marc Trévidic, in an interview last year.Standards for admissible evidence are lower in France than in the United States, Mr. Trévidic noted. Wiretaps and other surveillance are far more common and easily authorized, as well, allowing authorities to build cases that might be impossible elsewhere.Mr. Trévidic acknowledged, however, that the system “can produce abuses.”Nor is it fail-safe. In March, just days before Dr. Hicheur’s trial, police commandos in Toulouse killed Mohammed Merah, the 23-year-old self-proclaimed jihadi who killed seven people in a series of shootings that month.Like Dr. Hicheur, Mr. Merah had been under surveillance by French intelligence."
Tumbling Creatures,"Q. I bring home fresh produce from a garden that invariably has little critters embedded, sow bugs and the like. I put them outside on my 19th-floor window ledge, and they crawl or fall away. Do they get hurt?A. Probably not, in the opinion of Ward Wheeler, head of the division of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History.“Sow bugs are crustaceans, like shrimp, not insects,” Dr. Wheeler said. They have the advantage of reaching their top speed very quickly because of their small size, he said, “so they are likely fine.”He cited a famous 1928 essay, “On Being the Right Size,” by the biologist J. B. S. Haldane:“The resistance presented to movement by the air is proportional to the surface of the moving object. Divide an animal’s length, breadth and height each by 10; its weight is reduced to a thousandth, but its surface only to a hundredth. So the resistance to falling in the case of the small animal is relatively 10 times greater than the driving force.”Or as Haldane put it, more graphically: “You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on arriving at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided that the ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, a horse splashes.”C. CLAIBORNE RAY"
Huge Asteroid Is Still the Central Villain in Dinosaurs' Extinction,"For some 30 years, scientists have debated what sealed the fate of the dinosaurs. Was an asteroid impact more or less solely responsible for the catastrophic mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous geological period, 65 million years ago? Or were the dinosaurs already undergoing a long-term decline, and the asteroid was merely the coup de grâce?So three young researchers, led by Stephen L. Brusatte, a graduate student at Columbia University who is affiliated with the American Museum of Natural History, decided to test this hypothesis with a close examination of the fossil record over the 12 million years leading up to the mass extinction.For the study, the researchers departed from the practice of focusing almost exclusively on raw counts of the number of species over time. Instead, they analyzed changes in the anatomies and body plans of seven large groups of late Cretaceous dinosaurs for insights into their evolutionary trajectory.Groups that show an increase in variability, for example, might have been evolving into more species, giving them an ecological edge. But decreasing variability might be a warning sign of approaching doom.In science, alas, not all projects fulfill researchers’ ambitions. The findings of this one were mixed and generally inconclusive, Mr. Brusatte’s team reported in an article published online last week by the journal Nature Communications. At best, striking a positive note, the team wrote that the “calculations paint a more nuanced picture of the last 12 million years of dinosaur history.”As Mr. Brusatte explained, the late Cretaceous “wasn’t a static ‘lost world’ that was violently interrupted by an asteroid impact.” Some dinosaurs, he noted, “were undergoing dramatic changes during this time, and large herbivores seem to have been mired in a long-term decline, at least in North America.”The findings showed that duck-billed hadrosaurs and horned ceratopsids, two groups of large-bodied, bulk-feeding plant eaters (meaning they ate just about anything and everything) might have declined in diversity at this time. In contrast, small herbivores like the ankylosaurs and pachycephalosaurs, and the meat-eating tyrannosaurs and coelurosaurs, appeared to be holding steady or perhaps increasing in diversity. So, too, were the enormous herbivorous sauropods like apatosaurs.The results were not uniform on different continents. While hadrosaurs declined in North America, their diversity seemed to have been increasing in parts of Asia. The fossil record in many regions was insufficient for reliable analysis, meaning that the extinction debate will continue.Besides Mr. Brusatte, the other authors were Richard J. Butler of the University of Munich, Albert Prieto-Márquez of the Bavarian State Collection for Paleontology and Geology in Munich, and Mark A. Norell, an American Museum paleontologist who is Mr. Brusatte’s doctoral adviser.Dr. Norell said the study of skeletal changes in groups of species over time was “a novel way” to assess their prospects for survival over the long haul. “It would be nice to have more fossils to see how much these results are real,” he said.Paul C. Sereno, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago who had no part in the study, agreed that such investigations of life at the end of the Cretaceous had been “limited by the coarseness of the data where you really need it.” He questioned whether the research technique, though useful in studying simpler invertebrates, could be applied successfully to dinosaurs.“It’s an interesting study, and they are quality researchers,” Dr. Sereno said, “but I don’t think it changes the picture over all: Extinctions aren’t a simple process, but ultimately the asteroid was the major factor at the end of the Cretaceous.”"
Early Thinkers,"To the Editor:I was dismayed that “From the Minds of Babes” (May 1) did not reference the groundbreaking contributions of the Swiss child psychologist Jean Piaget (1896-1980). For over 50 years, Piaget sought to answer the same epistemological questions posed by Dr. Elizabeth S. Spelke. Piaget’s investigations into the origins of object permanence, number, geometry and time provide the foundations of Dr. Spelke’s research.In recent years, Piaget theory of cognitive stage development seems to have fallen out of favor. Thirty years ago, at any gathering of developmental or educational psychologists one would find numerous investigators presenting Piaget-based research papers. My last check of papers presented at recent American Psychological Association and the American Educational Research Association annual meetings found no mention of Piaget.Barry KaufmanOakland, Calif."
Zombie-Ant Fungus Has Its Own Killer Fungus,"Like something out of a horror movie, the zombie-ant fungus attacks and invades the brains of carpenter ants. Possessed ants march to their death, and the fungus lives inside the exoskeleton.Now, a new study reports that the zombie-ant fungus itself faces attack by another fungus.This secondary attacker, a white fungus, is “looking for its own lunch, and it thinks this dead ant is a nice thing to eat, along with the fungus that’s eating the ant,” said David Hughes, a disease biologist at Penn State and one of the authors.This attack prevents the spores of the zombie-ant fungus from spreading and infecting other ants in the colony, Dr. Hughes said.“Looking at the colony, it’s a good thing for the ants,” he said. “The enemy of my enemy is my friend.”It takes about three to nine days for ants to die after the zombie-ant fungus attacks. A month or two later, the white fungus might come along and attack the parasite growing from its remains, Dr. Hughes said.He and his colleagues studied carpenter ants in the rain forests of Brazil and southern Thailand. There are more than a thousand species of carpenter ants throughout the world.The intertwined lives of the fungi and the ants illustrate just how complex relationships are, Dr. Hughes said.This may be particularly true in rain forest settings, since there is no winter season in which food sources might diminish.“So life just becomes a nonstop hunt for lunch,” Dr. Hughes said. “We really haven’t gotten to the bottom of the complex interactions that are going on there.”The study appears in the journal PLoS One."
It's Not So Lonely at the Top: Ecosystems Thrive High in the Sky,"Looming over the northern edge of the Amazon rain forest are some of the most remarkable mountains on earth. Known as tepuis, or tabletop mountains, they are typically ringed by sheer cliffs that rise thousands of feet from the surrounding lowland jungles. Instead of peaks, tepuis have enormous flat expanses at their tops. To reach the tops of many tepuis, the only choices are scaling the cliffs or flying in a helicopter.For all their isolation, the tops of tepuis are not barren. They are like islands in the sky, covered with low forests and shrublands that support a diversity of animals likes frogs and lizards. Many of the species that live on top of the tepuis are found nowhere else on the planet.In a paper to be published in the journal Evolution, a team of scientists report the first DNA-based study to address an age-old question about the tepuis: How did animals and plants end up in such an inaccessible place?The researchers focused on tiny tree frogs that live only atop the tepuis. They came to the surprising conclusion: Over the past few million years, the frogs climbed up the colossal cliffs.“We may see those walls as being impossible for something to climb because just they’re so hard for us,” said the lead author, Patricia Salerno, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Texas. “But it is possible for these frogs to get up there. They’ve gotten up there several times.”Tepuis owe their fame in good measure to “The Lost World,” Arthur Conan Doyle’s 1912 novel, in which he drew from accounts of early explorers to imagine an isolated ecosystem on top of a tepui where dinosaurs and pterosaurs still lived. Tepuis have also figured in Hollywood movies, from the 1925 dramatization of “The Lost World” to the 2009 animated film “Up.”Some intrepid scientists scaled the tepuis to learn how they formed. Their history is very different from that of the nearby Andes, which formed like many mountain ranges do, as two continental plates collided 25 million years ago and thrust rock layers upward.The tepuis are far older. The highest layers of rock were formed by sand settling on the bottom of oceans more than two billion years ago. The sandstone was later lifted and become dry land. It began to erode and fragment about 300 million years ago, and by about 70 million years ago, the tepuis towered above the surrounding lowlands.Even more intriguing than the tepuis’ long isolation is that many species living atop them are found nowhere else.To many biologists, the only explanation that made sense was that the ancestors of those unique animals and plant species have lived on the tepuis for more than 70 million years. In honor of Conan Doyle, they called this notion the “lost world hypothesis.”Ms. Salerno realized that genetics offered a straightforward way to test this hypothesis. Over time, species accumulate new mutations in their DNA at a roughly regular rate. When two species diverge from a common ancestor, their DNA becomes steadily more different. Biologists can use this so-called molecular clock to estimate how long ago their common ancestor lived.Ms. Salerno decided to compare species from different tepuis to see how different their DNA had become. If the species had been on their tepuis ever since they formed, she reasoned, their common ancestor would have to be at least 70 million years old.Tree frogs would be a good group of species to study, she decided, because they move around very little during their lives. One species of tree frog found on the tepuis hides out inside one species of carnivorous plant during the day, for example, coming out only at night to hunt for insects. It’s therefore not surprising that 90 percent of frog species that live on the summits of tepuis are found nowhere else.Working with American and South American collaborators, Ms. Salerno has collected collected frog DNA from museum collections and trips to tepuis.For their study, the researchers compared the DNA from four closely related species of tree frogs, each found on a different tepui. They also analyzed the DNA of their closest lowland relatives.Ms. Salerno and her colleagues found that the frogs evolved long after the dinosaurs. The common ancestor of all four tepui frog species lived about 5.3 million years ago, not 70 million years ago. Some of the species diverged only a few hundred thousand years ago.“This is the first effort to get a feeling for the evolutionary aspects of this thing, and in that sense it’s a step forward,” said Roy McDiarmid, a herpetologist at the Smithsonian. He finds it plausible that the tree frogs scaled the tepuis only in the past few million years.But he doesn’t think a study on one group of frogs rules out the “lost world” hypothesis for other species. His own studies on toads, for example, suggest that they have been living on top of the tepuis since they formed. To see if he’s right, he’d like to be able to analyze their DNA as well.“The problem is we don’t have a lot of data,” Dr. McDiarmid said.There may not be much time left to gather data. Global warming has been driving mountain-dwelling species to higher altitudes, and will drive them up even farther. But the frogs and other species that are found only on top of tepuis have already gone as high as they can go. “They’re just going to go extinct,” Ms. Salerno said.The tepui frogs may have been able to scale cliffs that would make mountaineers blanch. But even they can’t climb into thin air."
Turning Up the Heat on Lettuce: Lettuce and Green Garlic Soup,"Every once in a while I put out a message on the Recipes for Health Facebook page asking readers to tell me what they’re getting in their C.S.A. produce baskets, what they need recipes for. The most recent responses reflected an overabundance of lettuce. One reader replied: “Lettuce. So much lettuce. Lettuce to the point where I get a nervous tic just thinking about eating another salad.”So I decided to devote most of the recipes this week to dishes that involve cooking lettuce. I couldn’t resist one simple romaine and radish salad, but the rest of the dishes are cooked. I used the tough outer leaves of romaine or leaf lettuce in blended sauces and entire heads in soups. I tested several classic French braised lettuce recipes, but as promising as these looked on paper, they didn’t appeal to me nearly as much as the more vibrant Chinese stir-fried lettuce dishes I tried, or the puréed soups. In the French braised dishes, the life seemed to be cooked out of the lettuces.I used sturdy lettuces like romaine and leaf lettuce for the cooked dishes, not tender spring mixes, which really should be dedicated to salads. Bitter lettuces with tough outer leaves, like curly endive (a k a escarole or chicory) and Batavia, stand up to cooking the same way greens like kale do. Use the recipes not only when you have a surfeit of lettuce in your C.S.A. basket, but also for the tough outer leaves of the one head of romaine in your fridge that you don’t want to include in your salads.The only recipe this week that has a high caloric content is a bean and chicory combo, and those calories and carbs come mostly from the beans, which also contribute lots of great nutrients, like protein and fiber.Lettuce and Green Garlic SoupUse a flavorful broth – chicken or vegetable – to enhance the subtle flavors in this thick, comforting soup.1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil1 medium onion, chopped1 bulb green garlic, stalks and papery layers removed, roughly chopped1/2 cup rice7 cups chicken or vegetable stock1/2 cup parsley leavesA bouquet garni made with a bay leaf and a few sprigs each parsley and thyme, tied togetherSalt to taste3/4 pound lettuce leaves, washed and coarsely chopped (8 cups)A generous amount of freshly ground pepper2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley or chives for garnishFreshly grated Parmesan for garnish 1. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy soup pot over medium heat and add the onion. Cook, stirring, until it is tender, about 5 minutes. Add a generous pinch of salt and the garlic and cook, stirring, until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the rice, stock, parsley leaves and bouquet garni, and bring to a boil. Add the lettuce and salt to taste, reduce the heat, cover and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes. The tough ribs of the lettuce leaves should be thoroughly tender.2. Using an immersion blender or a regular blender (working in batches and covering the blender with a kitchen towel to prevent the hot soup from splashing), blend the soup until smooth. If using a regular blender, return the soup to the heat. Add lots of freshly ground pepper, taste and adjust salt. Heat through and serve, garnishing each bowl with chopped fresh parsley or chives and freshly grated Parmesan.Yield: 4 servings.Advance preparation: You can make this a day ahead, but you will probably want to thin it out a bit when you reheat it.Nutritional information per serving: 174 calories; 4 grams fat; 1 gram saturated fat; 1 gram polyunsaturated fat; 3 grams monounsaturated fat; 0 milligrams cholesterol; 29 grams carbohydrates; 3 grams dietary fiber; 60 milligrams sodium (does not include salt to taste); 7 grams proteinMartha Rose Shulman is the author of “The Very Best of Recipes for Health.”  "
A Crocodile Too Huge To Fit on the Family Tree,"Giant crocodiles, far larger than any known to date, lived in Kenya two million to four million years ago among our human ancestors, according to a new report.A fossil of one specimen, 27 feet in length, shows that it is not closely related to the Nile crocodile, as some scientists had thought, said Christopher A. Brochu, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Iowa and the new study’s first author.Although the two crocodiles look similar, the ancient species has a different skull and jaw formation from the Nile crocodile.“There’s this misconception that crocodiles are these living fossils that haven’t changed,” he said. “This is something different, a species of a true crocodile, but different from anything known.”Dr. Brochu and his colleagues published their report in a recent issue of The Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Their findings mean that the origins of the Nile crocodile remain a bit of a mystery.Although crocodiles are ancient, they have evolved considerably over time. Today there are about three to five species of crocodiles in Africa, but in ancient times there may been twice as many, Dr. Brochu said.“This would have been a major part of the life our ancestors,” he said. “If there is something in the water that can swallow you whole, then you’re going to think about to how to approach the water.”"
Preserving Marine Life,"To the Editor:“Life in the Sea Found Its Fate in a Paroxysm of Extinction” (May 1) explains that ocean acidification and other factors drove a mass extinction, wiping out 95 percent of marine species. It’s even more startling that we’re now changing ocean chemistry even faster.Unless we reduce carbon dioxide emissions, ocean pH will change by 70 percent by 2050. Changing ocean chemistry is already hurting local economies. We must start now to avoid the next great extinction — the one set to begin in our lifetime.Andrew SharplessWashingtonThe writer is chief executive, Oceana."
Herd's Fate Lies in Preservation Clash,"COROLLA, N.C. — Come summer, the beaches of this barrier island will be choked with cars and sunbathers, but in the off-season the land is left to wild horses. Smallish, tending toward chestnut and black, they wander past deserted vacation rentals in harems of five or six.Thousands of them once roamed the length of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the likely descendants from mounts that belonged to Spanish explorers five centuries ago. Now their numbers have dwindled to a few hundred, the best known living on federal parkland at Shackleford Banks.But the largest herd, which has recently grown to almost 140 strong, occupies more than 7,500 acres of narrow land that stretches from the end of Highway 12 in Corolla (pronounced cor-AH-la) to the Virginia border, 11 miles north. Lacking natural predators, and trapped by fences that jut into the choppy Atlantic, the herd is becoming so inbred that its advocates fear a genetic collapse in mere generations.These supporters are leading a campaign to save the Corolla herd, and they have powerful allies in Congress. In February, the House passed a bill that would sustain the herd at about 120 and allow the importing of new mares from Shackleford for an introduction of fresh genes.Wildlife conservationists say the issue is not so simple. The beaches, marshes, grasslands and forests near Corolla are a stopover for flocks of endangered migratory birds, and nesting ground for sea turtles. Much of the horses’ range belongs to the Currituck National Wildlife Refuge, and defenders of the native habitat fear the herd’s current size strains the ecosystem.The future of the horses raises larger questions about whether one animal should be preserved at the expense of others — and who gets to decide.“This is about values,” said Michael Hutchins, executive director of the Wildlife Society, representing wildlife biologists and managers, which opposes the House measure. “I like horses; I think they are fascinating animals. I also deeply value what little we have left of our native species and their habitats.”Both sides invoke science to their cause. But data are sparse and a comprehensive study of the horses’ impact is not expected before next year.In the arena of political and public sentiment, the horses win hands down. Bonds between horse and human have existed for centuries; it is the animal that has pulled plows, and carried armies and settlers forward in the name of civilization.“God has put such a beautiful thing here — how can you not want to protect them?” said Betty Lane, 70, who has lived here for more than 40 years, driving her S.U.V. as part of a citizen patrol to protect the horses. (She stopped after mistaking a reporter for a tourist trying to get too close to the horses, in defiance of local law.) She wore a necklace bearing the name Spec, for a stallion killed by a hit-and-run driver on the beach.Dedication to wild horses runs so deep here and elsewhere that many supporters even chafe at the notion of calling the animals “non-native,” citing fossil records that horses lived in North America more than 11,000 years ago before going extinct along other Pleistocene creatures like mastodons.The wild horses of Corolla did not arise here, but they are domestic animals that have lost their domesticity. Though skeptics question whether the horses are indeed Spanish, an inspection from the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy and other groups has noted the horses’ short backs, low-set tails and other traits that make them distinct from other North American stock. A DNA analysis published February in Animal Genetics also points to a common origin for the horses, suggesting they may be a living relic of an Iberian breed that exists nowhere else.The study also confirms fears that the horses are growing perilously inbred. “There are wild herds with lower diversity, but not many,” said Gus Cothran, an expert in equine genetics at Texas A&M University who is lead author of the report. He says a herd of 60 could survive, provided a new mare entered the group every generation (about eight years). The federal bill sets a herd size at 110 to 130, the minimum number Dr. Cothran says could slow genetic erosion if the horses remain isolated.“We are not asking for hundreds of horses,” said Karen McCalpin, director of the Corolla Wild Horse Fund, which protects and cares for the horses, and leads public education about them. The heart of the disagreement with wildlife conservationists is over how many horses the habitat can bear. “If they were that detrimental for the environment,” she asked, “wouldn’t that be evident by now?”This question would be easier to answer if not for the matter of people. Other herds of Outer Banks horses live in expanses largely free of human intrusion. But the Corolla horses mostly live off people’s land and landscaping. Tourism promoters like to show horses frolicking in sand and surf, their manes blowing majestically, but these animals are just as likely to be spotted grazing alongside driveways.Genetics aside, tourists pose the biggest threat to the herd, whether from collisions with distracted drivers, or from photo-seeking vacationers who flout local code that makes it a crime to feed or get within 50 feet of a horse. Last summer a 2-week-old colt died of an intestinal blockage after eating watermelon rinds fed to it by visitors.As Corolla becomes more densely developed, the horses could be pushed more and more onto land set aside for wildlife sanctuaries. Last summer, out of concern for a species of bird called black rail, Mike Hoff, the refuge manager, fenced off a 135-acre swath of marshland after noting too many seasons of depleted grass. “It wasn’t that we wanted to exclude the horses because we don’t like them,” he said.One of the few studies to examine the horses’ direct impact was published in 2004 in The Journal of Range Management. Researchers from East Carolina University reported that in general, plants on Corolla recovered from one season of grazing by early the following summer. But the data were gathered in 1997, when the horse population was estimated at 43, spread across 11,400 acres. Today, the range is almost 4,000 acres smaller and the herd size has more than tripled.The continuing study of feral animals, financed jointly by the federal Fish and Wildlife Service and North Carolina State University, is intended to measure the effect of hogs and deer in addition to horses. Teasing out the horses’ impact “is a difficult question,” said Chris DePerno, who is leading the research, but he added, “We think we’ve designed a very, very good study.”In this case, politics and science may be operating on separate timetables. The Senate could take up the bill before Dr. DePerno’s study is complete. Ms. McCalpin lamented that the horses were already bearing hallmarks of genetic failure, with an occasional foal born astoundingly small, or with back knees that lock instead of hinge.“Time is running out,” she said, adding: “They’ve been here for five centuries. It makes me sad to think they might not be here for more.”"
Lenin’s Stroke: Doctor Has a Theory (and a Suspect),"BALTIMORE — The patient founded a totalitarian state known for its “merciless terror,” Dr. Victoria Giffi told a rapt audience of doctors and medical students on Friday afternoon. He died suddenly at 6:50 p.m. on Jan. 21, 1924, a few months before his 54th birthday. The cause of death: a massive stroke.The man’s cerebral arteries, Dr. Giffi added, were “so calcified that when tapped with tweezers they sounded like stone.”The occasion was a so-called clinicopathological conference, a mainstay of medical schools in which a mysterious medical case is presented to an audience of doctors and medical students. In the end, a pathologist solves the mystery with a diagnosis.But this was a conference with a twist. The patient was long dead — he was, in fact, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. The questions posed to the conference speakers: Why did he have a fatal stroke at such a young age? Was there something more to his death than history has acknowledged?At the University of Maryland, a clinicopathological conference focused on historical figures has been an annual event for the past 19 years; attending doctors have reviewed the case records of Florence Nightingale, Alexander the Great, Mozart, Beethoven and Edgar Allan Poe. The pathologists’ conclusion that Poe died of rabies even became a final question on the “Jeopardy!” game show.Dr. Philip A. Mackowiak, vice chairman of the university’s school of medicine and organizer of these conferences, said he later did a much more comprehensive review of Poe’s medical records and concluded that Poe’s doctor had embellished Poe’s medical history.“Poe was a hopeless alcoholic,” Dr. Mackowiak said in a telephone interview. “He almost certainly died of delirium tremens.”On Friday, two experts were called upon to solve the mystery of Lenin’s death: Dr. Harry Vinters, professor of neurology and neuropathology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Lev Lurie, a Russian historian in St. Petersburg.Dr. Vinters began by telling the audience some details of Lenin’s medical and family history.As a baby, Lenin had a head so large that he often fell over. He used to bang his head on the floor, making his mother worry that he might be mentally disabled.As an adult, Lenin suffered diseases that were common at the time: typhoid, toothaches, influenza and a painful skin infection called erysipelas. He was under intense stress, of course, which led to insomnia, migraines and abdominal pain.At 48, he was shot twice in an assassination attempt. One bullet lodged in his collarbone after puncturing his lung. Another got caught in the base of his neck. Both bullets remained in place for the rest of his life.Lenin’s father died early, too, at 54. The cause of death was said to be cerebral hemorrhage, but Lenin’s father had an illness at the time of his death that may have been typhoid fever.Most of Lenin’s seven brothers and sisters died young, two in infancy. A brother was executed at age 21 for plotting to assassinate Emperor Alexander III, and another brother died of typhoid at 19. Of the three who survived past young adulthood, a sister died of a stroke at age 71, another sister died of a heart attack at 59, and a brother died at age 69 of “stenocardia,” an archaic medical term whose meaning is no longer clear.In the two years before he died, Lenin had three debilitating strokes. Prominent European doctors were consulted and proposed a variety of diagnoses: nervous exhaustion, chronic lead intoxication from the two bullets lodged in his body, cerebral arteriosclerosis and “endarteritis luetica.”Dr. Vinters speculates that the last term referred to meningovascular syphilis, inflammation of the walls of blood vessels mainly around the brain, resulting in a thickening of the interior of the vessel. But there was no evidence of this on autopsy, and Lenin’s syphilis test was said to have been negative. He had been treated anyway with injections of a solution containing arsenic, the prevailing syphilis remedy.Then, in his last hours and days of his life, Lenin experienced severe seizures.An autopsy revealed a near total obstruction of the arteries leading to the brain, some of which were narrowed to tiny slits. But Lenin did not have some of the traditional risk factors for strokes.He did not have untreated high blood pressure — had that been his problem, the left side of his heart would have been enlarged. He did not smoke and would not tolerate smoking in his presence. He drank only occasionally and exercised regularly. He did not have symptoms of a brain infection, nor did he have a brain tumor.So what brought on the stroke that killed Lenin?The clues lie in Lenin’s family history, Dr. Vinters said. The three siblings who survived beyond their 20s had evidence of cardiovascular disease, and Lenin’s father died of a disease that was described as being very much like Lenin’s. Dr. Vinters said Lenin might have inherited a tendency to develop extremely high cholesterol, causing the severe blockage of his blood vessels that led to his stroke.Compounding that was the stress Lenin experienced, which can precipitate a stroke in someone whose blood vessels are already blocked.But Lenin’s seizures in the hours and days before he died are a puzzle and perhaps historically significant. Severe seizures, Dr. Vinters said in an interview before the conference, are “quite unusual in a stroke patient.”But, he added, “almost any poison can cause seizures.”Dr. Lurie concurred on Friday, telling the conference that poison was in his opinion the most likely immediate cause of Lenin’s death. The most likely perpetrator? Stalin, who saw Lenin as his main obstacle to taking over the Soviet Union and wanted to get rid of him.Communist Russia in the early 1920s, Dr. Lurie told the conference, was a place of “Mafia-like intrigue.”In 1921 Lenin started complaining that he was ill. From then until his death in 1924, Lenin “began to feel worse and worse,” Dr. Lurie said.“He complained that he couldn’t sleep and that he had terrible headaches. He could not write, he did not want to work,” Dr. Lurie said. He wrote to Alexei Maximovich Gorky, “I am so tired, I do not want to do anything at all.”But he nonetheless was planning a political attack on Stalin, Dr. Lurie said. And Stalin, well aware of Lenin’s intentions, sent a top-secret note to the Politburo in 1923 claiming that Lenin himself asked to be put out of his misery.The note said: “On Saturday, March 17th in the strictest secrecy Comrade Krupskaya told me of ‘Vladimir Ilyich’s request to Stalin,’ namely that I, Stalin, should take the responsibility for finding and administering to Lenin a dose of potassium cyanide. I felt it impossible to refuse him, and declared: ‘I would like Vladimir Ilyich to be reassured and to believe that when it is necessary I will fulfill his demand without hesitation.’”Stalin added that he just could not do it: “I do not have the strength to carry out Ilyich’s request and I have to decline this mission, however humane and necessary it might be, and I therefore report this to the members of the Politburo.”Dr. Lurie said Stalin might have poisoned Lenin despite this assurance, as Stalin was “absolutely ruthless.”Dr. Vinters believes that sky-high cholesterol leading to a stroke was the main cause of Lenin’s death. But he said there is one other puzzling aspect of the story. Although toxicology studies were done on others in Russia, there was an order that no toxicology be done on Lenin’s tissues.So the mystery remains.But if Lenin had lived today, or if today’s cholesterol-lowering drugs had been available 100 years ago, might he have been spared those strokes?“Yes,” Dr. Vinters said. “Lenin could have gone on for another 20 or 25 years, assuming he wasn’t assassinated. History would have been totally different.”"
H.I.V./AIDS: Voices From Cuba,"Yudelsy García O’ConnorYudelsy García O’Connor was the first known H.I.V.-positive baby in Cuba. Born Aug. 14, 1986, she is now 25 — tiny, but healthy. She is also lively, funny and irreverent, divorced and hoping to remarry and have children.She was 3 before anyone realized that she was infected. Her father had been a soldier stationed in Angola. On his return in 1982, he worked as a truck driver, a job that helped him have girlfriends all over this island; he infected five of them.Ms. García’s illness was discovered through a long line of contact-tracing. Her father had divorced her mother, but his second wife tested positive during a routine pregnancy screening. He was asked to name all his sexual partners, they and their children were tested.Her growth was stunted, and she had anemia and lung problems. There were no drugs for AIDS at the time, but in 1990 she and her mother were moved to the country’s first sanitarium, in Santiago de Las Vegas, near Havana, and she grew up there.“From the beginning, she captured our hearts,” Dr. Jorge Pérez Ávila, Cuba’s leading AIDS doctor, wrote in “AIDS: Confessions to a Doctor,” his memoir of his favorite patients, living and dead. “She was very thin, dark-haired, small and congenial, eager to play with anyone around.”In 1993, when sympathetic Americans smuggled the experimental new drug AZT into Cuba, Ms. García was one of the first to get it.When Cuba started producing its own basic AIDS drugs in 2001, she got triple therapy.Now she has two modern drugs in her mix, thanks to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which pays for some of the newer drugs that Cuba doesn’t make.As a youngster, she was a poster child for the country’s effective AIDS program. She met the pope and former President Jimmy Carter.But the system that sheltered her has now forgotten her.At 21, she married another sanitarium resident and moved with him to his hometown — Aguacate, a flea-bitten place an hour’s drive from Havana where most residents work at a sugar refinery.Her mother died in 2010, after she temporarily stopped taking her medicine. Then Ms. García’s husband left her; she tears up at any mention of that.She now shares a one-bedroom shack in Aguacate with a friend. Her espresso pot has no lid. She turns on her hot plate by hooking two bare wires together.She earns $8 a month overseeing a refinery vat, with a $10 bonus if she has no sick days.It’s a long way from her happy sanitarium childhood; she is proud that she has her own place, but wishes she could afford to return to Havana.Enrique Lopez VizcainoEnrique Lopez Vizcaino, 58, is a retired lieutenant colonel, an educator at the National Center for AIDS Prevention — and a medical marvel.He was infected in 1977, four years before the “discovery” of AIDS was announced in an American medical journal’s article about unusual pneumonias in gay men.He did not get antiretroviral drugs until 1996, but he is clearly a rare “slow progressor” — someone whose immune system is much better than average at fighting the virus.He did have two bouts with leukemia, in 1991 and 2005, but it seems to be in remission.Mr. Vizcaino is certain of his infection date because of his sexual history. As a young lieutenant, he was stationed from 1976 to 1979 in Pointe Noire, Republic of Congo, as a military adviser to the Congolese army.The only woman he slept with during those years, he said, was a Soviet woman, a language teacher also stationed there.“AIDS was unknown at the time, of course,” he said, “but I was careful of Congolese women because there were many other diseases.”Her name was Noema, but he could not recall her surname. During their affair, she taught him French and he taught her Spanish.After his infection was diagnosed in late 1986, he wrote to her in Russia and they spoke on the phone. She said she had slept with Congolese men, he said. By 1986 she was already sick; she died in 1989.As luck would have it, he did not pass on his infection to the first two girlfriends he had after returning home. But his third, whom he married, he did infect. They moved to a sanitarium together, and she died there in 1994.Maria Elena Becquer lived in the same sanitarium and was recovering from a mastectomy. She also lost her spouse, who had become infected while stationed as a translator in Ethiopia.“Slowly, our story began growing like a tree,” she said. “We had both lost someone important to us, and I saw he was a man who needed to keep living.”Two years later, they were married. They remained in the sanitarium until 2003, when they found jobs as AIDS educators and moved to a sunny walk-up across the harbor from downtown Havana.“It’s our little love nest.” Ms. Becquer said. “People say, ‘Oh, you were so unlucky to have all these diseases.’ But now all we ask is life — give us life to see our families, to finish our plans.”Carlos Emilio GarcíaCarlos Emilio García, 50, is both a nurse and a resident at the sanitarium in Santiago de Las Vegas.When he is not on his shift in the small psychiatric ward, he lives in a neat bungalow he shares with a roommate. An advertising poster featuring a bare, soapy man dominates the tiled living room.Four of his former roommates have left to live outside, but he chooses to stay.“My job is here, and I have everything I need,” he said. His family’s home is so crowded that he would have to share it with his parents, nine siblings, their children and some cousins.“We like living together, but there’s not much room,” he said. “Actually, I wish I could move some of them in here with me, but it’s not allowed.”Also, he said, his salary is only $20 a month, too little to live on the outside. And even if he found a place, just getting through the paperwork of finding subsidized housing and being accepted by the local Committee for the Defense of the Revolution would take months.At his previous hospital job, he had an AIDS test every six months from 1990 through 1996. But in 1997, right after he had a bout with nausea and diarrhea — a typical response to an early infection — he tested H.I.V.-positive.Asked why a registered nurse who understood AIDS and had been tested many times would have sex without a condom, he shrugged, waved his hands in the air and said: “Oh you know — because we all do crazy things sometimes.”Just once?, he was asked.“Oh, no. Lots of times. I don’t know who my assassin was.”Mariela Mendoza Ramos and Elio Bravo RuizMariela Mendoza Ramos, 58, and Elio Bravo Ruiz, 53, met and married at the Santiago de Las Vegas sanitarium. Both had become infected in Angola. She was a nurse-anesthesiologist in southern Angola, where the fighting against the South Africans was fiercest. He was a low-ranking soldier near the northern border, mostly doing guard duty. Like Mr. Vizcaino, he was one of the first Cubans infected, since he was in Angola from 1976 to 1981; in the national case log, he is Patient No. 20.Mrs. Mendoza believes she was infected by one of many cuts and needle sticks she got then. “We were doing surgery in the jungle,” she said. “We didn’t even have gloves.”He has no doubt he was infected by sex. “I was 18, I was unmarried, I was just a kid, I went with lots of women,” he said. “Nobody used condoms back then. Nobody had heard of AIDS.”He was 25 when he was tested, he said. He had barely heard of AIDS and bristled when the doctors asked him if he was gay. The first years in the sanitarium were hard, he said; he was one of many apparently healthy young soldiers who had just been told they would be locked away for life.Now he’s happy; he and his wife have one of the largest cabanas, with a garden full of flowers and a porch with lounge chairs and potted palms. Mrs. Mendoza said she her first husband was also a soldier stationed in Angola. In 1988, they were both tested on their return, and she was the only one infected. They divorced so she would not infect the man she still loved. They did it for the sake of their 8-year-old son, who had lived with his grandparents while they were overseas.In those days, everyone died of AIDS, she said, “and there would be no one left to take care of our son.”Maria Julia Fernandez AlvarezMaria Julia Fernandez, 59, is the widow of Cuba’s Patient No. 1.Although she has come to terms with her lot in life, she resents it.She has wrinkles now, and tires easily. Chemotherapy for abdominal cancer has robbed her of her hair — but the fiery eyes that made her a leader for many sanitarium patients are still blazing.“I had only one man in my life, and after he died, I was afraid to have sex with any others,” she said. “And now I don’t think I will. And I never wanted to go to the sanitariums, but I had to live there for 10 years — at first by force, and then by circumstances.”She spoke as she sat on the couch of her third-floor walk-up in downtown Havana. The building is dark and battered, but her apartment is spotless, with a view of the dome of the old Capitol, a gray copy of the one in Washington. Everything is pink: walls, curtains and bedspread, and bouquets of plastic flowers.She met her husband, Reynaldo Morales, when they both worked at Granma, the party newspaper, she as a secretary, he as a driver for the editors.In 1984, he was sent to Angola.“Yes, he ‘volunteered,’ ” she said, bitterly. “But you know what that meant back then. If you were connected to the party, and you didn’t ‘volunteer,’ it was a black mark on your record.”He arrived home in 1986, just as Cuba bought its first AIDS tests. Though it later became clear that he was not the first Cuban infected, he was in the first group tested, and became Patient No. 1 in the national records. She was infected in the brief time they had together between his return and the test results coming back.While she is serious, her husband was a practical joker, a buddy to everyone. He was first quarantined in a naval hospital with other soldiers, and used to describe how stir-crazy they went, smuggling in rum and once breaking out on a bedsheet rope. That April, Cuba opened its first sanitarium, and Maria and Reynaldo were the first couple admitted.“Soldiers guarded us, and I didn’t see my son again until November, and then it was with a chaperon,” she said. “He was 9, and I had to accept seeing him once a week. I lost the nicest years of his life.”Still, they had a cottage, and life inside was comfortable. Her husband became the compound’s carpenter and electrician. She formed the first patient group. It slowly won greater rights, including weekend passes without a chaperon.“It was hard, but I learned to accept the irony of my life,” she said. “I was 32 when I went in, and absolutely homophobic: I came from a society very prejudiced against gay people, and soon most of the men inside were gay and the women were prostitutes. I had to share rooms, and a table, with these people. It was very, very hard. But I learned to love others for who they were.”When the quarantine policy changed in 1993, she and Reynaldo were the first offered the chance to leave. But they declined. He felt useful and was surrounded by friends. He was also getting sicker and feared how people outside would look at him once word spread that he was dying of AIDS. He died in 1995, at the age of 42.She moved out the next year. Her sister had lived in her apartment, and Granma had paid her $7-a-month salary during the decade she was inside, so she had enough saved to buy title.She is now an educator at the national center for AIDS prevention. And she’s glad she no longer lives in the sanitarium.“Life is out here,” she said.Lenia Cespedes RodriguezLenia Cespedes Rodriguez, 35, is one of a handful of Cubans infected by a blood transfusion.In 1983, after President Fidel Castro ordered the country’s doctors to take steps to keep AIDS out of the country, one of their first moves was to throw out all imported blood; they discarded 20,000 units.It seemed prudent since there was no test for H.I.V. and Cuba had no known AIDS cases, while Haiti did and had previously exported huge amounts of blood. In the United States and France, infected clotting factor ultimately killed most of a generation of hemophiliacs.Since tests arrived in 1986, there have been 27 million transfusions in Cuba, with almost no transmissions.Ms. Cespedes, a pricing expert for state stores, is an exception. In early 2002, she had surgery for an ectopic pregnancy and needed a transfusion. About a month later, a newborn transfused with blood from the same donor had a mysterious fever.It turned out the baby was infected. The original donor apparently had been in the “window period” when the virus is in the blood, but antibodies have not yet formed.Other than a fever 12 days after her transfusion — a typical reaction to a new H.I.V. infection — Ms. Cespedes has had no symptoms. Her CD4 count has stayed high enough that she was not put on medication under Cuba’s national treatment protocols.Her first husband divorced her after she became infected. She and her second husband have always used condoms, she said, but now they want to have a baby. To drive down her viral load so there is virtually no chance she will infect him through unprotected sex, she began taking the drugs last spring.Her bond with Dr. Pérez, who has overseen her treatment from the beginning, is obvious.“She cries with me a lot,” he said. “She is more than a patient; we are friends.”Ms. Cespedes confirmed that.“If I have a boy, I’m going to name him Jorge,” she said.And if it’s a girl?“Jorgina.”"
Cuba’s Fortresses Against a Viral Foe,"SANTIAGO DE LAS VEGAS, Cuba — When H.I.V. testing began in Cuba in 1986, infections were found first in soldiers who had been in Africa. Initially locked in the national Naval Hospital, they were frustrated, since they were still healthy. There were escapes on bedsheet ropes; rum was smuggled in.As their numbers grew and more civilians tested positive, the government opened sanitariums — both to keep the infected from having sex with anyone uninfected and to help them die comfortably.At first the institutions were run by military doctors and guarded by soldiers; patients had home visits only with escorts.But life inside was not brutal. Inmates got food, medical care and their old salaries; theater troupes and art classes formed. Gay men could live together, which was not true in the macho culture outside.The network of sanitariums grew to 14. They were harshly criticized — Dr. Jonathan Mann, the first AIDS director at the World Health Organization, called them “pretty prisons” — but they had a huge damping effect on the early epidemic. Fewer than 150 new cases were detected in the country each year through 1990.The policy had a few unintended consequences. To stay out, some Cubans tried to avoid testing. But a few others, usually teenagers estranged from their families, deliberately got themselves infected to get in.The policy also affected the virus; researchers believe Cuba’s 11 unique recombinant H.I.V. strains emerged from intra-sanitarium sex.Starting in 1989, a new director of the network, Dr. Jorge Pérez Ávila, who is now Cuba’s leading AIDS physician, slowly eased restrictions. Trusted patients could leave without escorts.In 1993, the gates were opened and outpatient care became the norm. Initially, however, 40 percent of the inhabitants stayed. With the Soviet Union’s collapse, “those were really bad days,” Dr. Pérez said. “The economy was destroyed.”Now, however, just three sanitariums remain. A reporter was allowed to visit two.Santiago de las Vegas, the first to open, still has 200 patients, down from 340 at its peak. It is about a half-hour drive southwest of Havana, on the grounds of Los Cocos, an estate that belonged to a relative of the ousted dictator Fulgencio Batista. (The large oil of a flamenco dancer in the hacienda, according to snickering but unverifiable sanitarium lore, was the former owner in drag.)Some of its buildings are rundown, but it is still lush, with fountains, lawns and towering palms.Patients like Carlos Emilio García, a nurse who also works inside, live rent-free in white bungalows with TVs, air-conditioning, refrigerators and stoves. In the psychiatric ward, five patients watched TV under the eyes of two nurses.The sanitarium in Sancti Spíritus, in central Cuba, is more disheveled but is being spruced up. A former vacation camp for the Ministry of Construction, it has 63 employees. But the patient population is down to 21."
Research Center to Focus on Cancer Genes,"To Dr. Susan Domchek, an oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania, the phone call from Jon and Mindy Gray last summer was no different from many others she has received from people seeking information about genetic mutations that can cause cancer. She spoke with the couple for an hour or so, and afterward gave it little thought.“This is embarrassing,” she recalled. “I had no idea who they were.” Nor did she realize that she had just closed a $25 million deal.Mr. Gray, 42, is a superstar in the financial world, the global head of real estate at the investment firm Blackstone. Mrs. Gray, 41, had lost a sister to ovarian cancer caused by an inherited mutation in a gene called BRCA. The couple had been looking for the best place to start a major center for research, counseling, cancer prevention and treatment for people with BRCA mutations.After speaking with Dr. Domchek, they decided that place was the University of Pennsylvania. Both had attended college there. The Basser Research Center — named for Mrs. Gray’s sister, Faith Basser — is expected to open in July with Dr. Domchek as its executive director. It will be the first comprehensive center to focus on a specific set of mutations known to cause cancer.Cancer experts say that what may appear to be an extremely narrow research focus actually has broad implications. Mutations in two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are estimated to cause 5 percent to 10 percent of breast cancers and 10 percent to 15 percent of ovarian cancers among white women in the United States. The mutations are found in other racial and ethnic groups, too, but there is not enough data to tell how common they are. In all groups, the mutations increase the risk of certain other cancers as well.Normally, BRCA genes help prevent cancer; mutations disable them and make tumors more likely. Understanding how the genes work may provide information that is relevant to cancers even in people who do not carry these particular mutations.“This will open doors to understanding the biology of breast cancer that would not have been opened otherwise,” said Mary Claire King, a geneticist at the University of Washington who was the first to identify a breast cancer gene, BRCA1. “I cannot think of an area of breast cancer biology that would not be related to BRCA. These genes are involved in critical areas of DNA repair that are essential to breast cancer development.”When Ms. Basser became ill, Mr. Gray said: “There was no one place to go. We felt lost, blindly searching the Internet.”Her illness was also their first inkling that her family might have an inherited mutation. Mrs. Gray was tested, but declined to discuss the results. The couple has four daughters.The Grays are hoping that the new center will allow people who have mutations, or whose family histories indicate that they might, to find everything they need in one place.Women with mutations are often advised to have their breasts and ovaries removed as a preventive measure. “We want to make sure people facing these difficult issues have a place to go,” Mr. Gray said.They also want to free scientists from having to spend huge amounts of time applying for research grants, Mr. Gray said, describing the process as “brilliant minds being wasted on paperwork.”But their greatest hope is that the research will find better ways of preventing cancer, so that mutation carriers no longer face draconian choices like preventive surgery.“This is a hard nut to crack, and it’s going to take the longest,” Dr. Domchek said, explaining that researchers would try to develop vaccines to prevent cancer and identify drugs that could safely be used to lower the risk in mutation carriers.The center will also try to find ways to detect ovarian cancer earlier, in hopes of saving women’s lives, she said. Now, most cases are not detected until they are fairly advanced.Not every mutation carrier develops cancer, and the researchers will try to identify other genes that may also contribute, in hopes of figuring out which patients have the highest risk and which, if any, can delay or even skip preventive surgery.The initial $25 million donation will probably support about five years of research.“Philanthropy is becoming an increasingly important part of funding biomedical research,” Dr. Domchek said, because there is nowhere near enough government money to go around, and only a small percentage of all grant applications are approved.Dr. King predicted that the donation would lead to great things.“It’s the nature of genetics that when you start with a gene, you are soon led to a very large number of fascinating questions that begin with the gene and go on to the cell, and the tissue, and the person, and the population,” she said."
Herd&#8217;s Fate Lies in Preservation Clash,"COROLLA, N.C. — Come summer, the beaches of this barrier island will be choked with cars and sunbathers, but in the off-season the land is left to wild horses. Smallish, tending toward chestnut and black, they wander past deserted vacation rentals in harems of five or six.Thousands of them once roamed the length of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the likely descendants from mounts that belonged to Spanish explorers five centuries ago. Now their numbers have dwindled to a few hundred, the best known living on federal parkland at Shackleford Banks.But the largest herd, which has recently grown to almost 140 strong, occupies more than 7,500 acres of narrow land that stretches from the end of Highway 12 in Corolla (pronounced cor-AH-la) to the Virginia border, 11 miles north. Lacking natural predators, and trapped by fences that jut into the choppy Atlantic, the herd is becoming so inbred that its advocates fear a genetic collapse in mere generations.These supporters are leading a campaign to save the Corolla herd, and they have powerful allies in Congress. In February, the House passed a bill that would sustain the herd at about 120 and allow the importing of new mares from Shackleford for an introduction of fresh genes.Wildlife conservationists say the issue is not so simple. The beaches, marshes, grasslands and forests near Corolla are a stopover for flocks of endangered migratory birds, and nesting ground for sea turtles. Much of the horses’ range belongs to the Currituck National Wildlife Refuge, and defenders of the native habitat fear the herd’s current size strains the ecosystem.The future of the horses raises larger questions about whether one animal should be preserved at the expense of others — and who gets to decide.“This is about values,” said Michael Hutchins, executive director of the Wildlife Society, representing wildlife biologists and managers, which opposes the House measure. “I like horses; I think they are fascinating animals. I also deeply value what little we have left of our native species and their habitats.”Both sides invoke science to their cause. But data are sparse and a comprehensive study of the horses’ impact is not expected before next year.In the arena of political and public sentiment, the horses win hands down. Bonds between horse and human have existed for centuries; it is the animal that has pulled plows, and carried armies and settlers forward in the name of civilization.“God has put such a beautiful thing here — how can you not want to protect them?” said Betty Lane, 70, who has lived here for more than 40 years, driving her S.U.V. as part of a citizen patrol to protect the horses. (She stopped after mistaking a reporter for a tourist trying to get too close to the horses, in defiance of local law.) She wore a necklace bearing the name Spec, for a stallion killed by a hit-and-run driver on the beach.Dedication to wild horses runs so deep here and elsewhere that many supporters even chafe at the notion of calling the animals “non-native,” citing fossil records that horses lived in North America more than 11,000 years ago before going extinct along other Pleistocene creatures like mastodons.The wild horses of Corolla did not arise here, but they are domestic animals that have lost their domesticity. Though skeptics question whether the horses are indeed Spanish, an inspection from the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy and other groups has noted the horses’ short backs, low-set tails and other traits that make them distinct from other North American stock. A DNA analysis published February in Animal Genetics also points to a common origin for the horses, suggesting they may be a living relic of an Iberian breed that exists nowhere else.The study also confirms fears that the horses are growing perilously inbred. “There are wild herds with lower diversity, but not many,” said Gus Cothran, an expert in equine genetics at Texas A&M University who is lead author of the report. He says a herd of 60 could survive, provided a new mare entered the group every generation (about eight years). The federal bill sets a herd size at 110 to 130, the minimum number Dr. Cothran says could slow genetic erosion if the horses remain isolated.“We are not asking for hundreds of horses,” said Karen McCalpin, director of the Corolla Wild Horse Fund, which protects and cares for the horses, and leads public education about them. The heart of the disagreement with wildlife conservationists is over how many horses the habitat can bear. “If they were that detrimental for the environment,” she asked, “wouldn’t that be evident by now?”This question would be easier to answer if not for the matter of people. Other herds of Outer Banks horses live in expanses largely free of human intrusion. But the Corolla horses mostly live off people’s land and landscaping. Tourism promoters like to show horses frolicking in sand and surf, their manes blowing majestically, but these animals are just as likely to be spotted grazing alongside driveways.Genetics aside, tourists pose the biggest threat to the herd, whether from collisions with distracted drivers, or from photo-seeking vacationers who flout local code that makes it a crime to feed or get within 50 feet of a horse. Last summer a 2-week-old colt died of an intestinal blockage after eating watermelon rinds fed to it by visitors.As Corolla becomes more densely developed, the horses could be pushed more and more onto land set aside for wildlife sanctuaries. Last summer, out of concern for a species of bird called black rail, Mike Hoff, the refuge manager, fenced off a 135-acre swath of marshland after noting too many seasons of depleted grass. “It wasn’t that we wanted to exclude the horses because we don’t like them,” he said.One of the few studies to examine the horses’ direct impact was published in 2004 in The Journal of Range Management. Researchers from East Carolina University reported that in general, plants on Corolla recovered from one season of grazing by early the following summer. But the data were gathered in 1997, when the horse population was estimated at 43, spread across 11,400 acres. Today, the range is almost 4,000 acres smaller and the herd size has more than tripled.The continuing study of feral animals, financed jointly by the federal Fish and Wildlife Service and North Carolina State University, is intended to measure the effect of hogs and deer in addition to horses. Teasing out the horses’ impact “is a difficult question,” said Chris DePerno, who is leading the research, but he added, “We think we’ve designed a very, very good study.”In this case, politics and science may be operating on separate timetables. The Senate could take up the bill before Dr. DePerno’s study is complete. Ms. McCalpin lamented that the horses were already bearing hallmarks of genetic failure, with an occasional foal born astoundingly small, or with back knees that lock instead of hinge.“Time is running out,” she said, adding: “They’ve been here for five centuries. It makes me sad to think they might not be here for more.”"
Flood of Donations to Fight AIDS Appears Not to Detract From Other Health Issues,"Pouring donor money into fighting AIDS in a poor African country does not necessarily detract from addressing other medical problems there, like malaria, malnutrition and infections, a six-year study in Rwanda has found.But the authors said their findings were applicable mostly to Rwanda, where a foresighted government deliberately moved to prevent a flood of donor money for AIDS from undermining other public health goals.The study by Brandeis University health policy analysts, published this month in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, compared 25 rural Rwandan clinics that offered AIDS treatment with 25 similar clinics that did not.Both sets of clinics improved in medical care as Rwanda rolled out $2-a-year national health insurance in 1999. But the AIDS clinics improved more rapidly, even by measures not related to AIDS, like giving vaccines, curing other illnesses and moving patients to hospitals. Extra training for AIDS doctors and nurses made them better doctors and nurses over all.Wu Zeng, a study author, said the government of President Paul Kagame, which has been in power since the 1994 genocide, recognized that donor money could inflate salaries for AIDS specialists and decreed that other doctors would be paid equally.Asked whether Rwanda, a poor but compact and well-organized country, was a realistic model for Africa, Donald S. Shepard, the study’s lead author, responded: “What they’re doing isn’t rocket science. Other countries can apply these ideas.”"
Huge Asteroid Is Still the Central Villain in Dinosaurs’ Extinction,"For some 30 years, scientists have debated what sealed the fate of the dinosaurs. Was an asteroid impact more or less solely responsible for the catastrophic mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous geological period, 65 million years ago? Or were the dinosaurs already undergoing a long-term decline, and the asteroid was merely the coup de grâce?So three young researchers, led by Stephen L. Brusatte, a graduate student at Columbia University who is affiliated with the American Museum of Natural History, decided to test this hypothesis with a close examination of the fossil record over the 12 million years leading up to the mass extinction.For the study, the researchers departed from the practice of focusing almost exclusively on raw counts of the number of species over time. Instead, they analyzed changes in the anatomies and body plans of seven large groups of late Cretaceous dinosaurs for insights into their evolutionary trajectory.Groups that show an increase in variability, for example, might have been evolving into more species, giving them an ecological edge. But decreasing variability might be a warning sign of approaching doom.In science, alas, not all projects fulfill researchers’ ambitions. The findings of this one were mixed and generally inconclusive, Mr. Brusatte’s team reported in an article published online last week by the journal Nature Communications. At best, striking a positive note, the team wrote that the “calculations paint a more nuanced picture of the last 12 million years of dinosaur history.”As Mr. Brusatte explained, the late Cretaceous “wasn’t a static ‘lost world’ that was violently interrupted by an asteroid impact.” Some dinosaurs, he noted, “were undergoing dramatic changes during this time, and large herbivores seem to have been mired in a long-term decline, at least in North America.”The findings showed that duck-billed hadrosaurs and horned ceratopsids, two groups of large-bodied, bulk-feeding plant eaters (meaning they ate just about anything and everything) might have declined in diversity at this time. In contrast, small herbivores like the ankylosaurs and pachycephalosaurs, and the meat-eating tyrannosaurs and coelurosaurs, appeared to be holding steady or perhaps increasing in diversity. So, too, were the enormous herbivorous sauropods like apatosaurs.The results were not uniform on different continents. While hadrosaurs declined in North America, their diversity seemed to have been increasing in parts of Asia. The fossil record in many regions was insufficient for reliable analysis, meaning that the extinction debate will continue.Besides Mr. Brusatte, the other authors were Richard J. Butler of the University of Munich, Albert Prieto-Márquez of the Bavarian State Collection for Paleontology and Geology in Munich, and Mark A. Norell, an American Museum paleontologist who is Mr. Brusatte’s doctoral adviser.Dr. Norell said the study of skeletal changes in groups of species over time was “a novel way” to assess their prospects for survival over the long haul. “It would be nice to have more fossils to see how much these results are real,” he said.Paul C. Sereno, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago who had no part in the study, agreed that such investigations of life at the end of the Cretaceous had been “limited by the coarseness of the data where you really need it.” He questioned whether the research technique, though useful in studying simpler invertebrates, could be applied successfully to dinosaurs.“It’s an interesting study, and they are quality researchers,” Dr. Sereno said, “but I don’t think it changes the picture over all: Extinctions aren’t a simple process, but ultimately the asteroid was the major factor at the end of the Cretaceous.”"
Tumbling Creatures,"Q. I bring home fresh produce from a garden that invariably has little critters embedded, sow bugs and the like. I put them outside on my 19th-floor window ledge, and they crawl or fall away. Do they get hurt?A. Probably not, in the opinion of Ward Wheeler, head of the division of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History.“Sow bugs are crustaceans, like shrimp, not insects,” Dr. Wheeler said. They have the advantage of reaching their top speed very quickly because of their small size, he said, “so they are likely fine.”He cited a famous 1928 essay, “On Being the Right Size,” by the biologist J. B. S. Haldane:“The resistance presented to movement by the air is proportional to the surface of the moving object. Divide an animal’s length, breadth and height each by 10; its weight is reduced to a thousandth, but its surface only to a hundredth. So the resistance to falling in the case of the small animal is relatively 10 times greater than the driving force.”Or as Haldane put it, more graphically: “You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on arriving at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided that the ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, a horse splashes.”C. CLAIBORNE RAY"
Preserving Marine Life (1 Letter),"To the Editor:“Life in the Sea Found Its Fate in a Paroxysm of Extinction” (May 1) explains that ocean acidification and other factors drove a mass extinction, wiping out 95 percent of marine species. It’s even more startling that we’re now changing ocean chemistry even faster.Unless we reduce carbon dioxide emissions, ocean pH will change by 70 percent by 2050. Changing ocean chemistry is already hurting local economies. We must start now to avoid the next great extinction — the one set to begin in our lifetime.Andrew SharplessWashingtonThe writer is chief executive, Oceana."
Early Thinkers (1 Letter),"To the Editor:I was dismayed that “From the Minds of Babes” (May 1) did not reference the groundbreaking contributions of the Swiss child psychologist Jean Piaget (1896-1980). For over 50 years, Piaget sought to answer the same epistemological questions posed by Dr. Elizabeth S. Spelke. Piaget’s investigations into the origins of object permanence, number, geometry and time provide the foundations of Dr. Spelke’s research.In recent years, Piaget theory of cognitive stage development seems to have fallen out of favor. Thirty years ago, at any gathering of developmental or educational psychologists one would find numerous investigators presenting Piaget-based research papers. My last check of papers presented at recent American Psychological Association and the American Educational Research Association annual meetings found no mention of Piaget.Barry KaufmanOakland, Calif."
Help for the Pregnant (1 Letter),"To the Editor:Re “Abuse of Opiates Soars in Pregnant Women” (May 1): Opiate dependence is a chronic medical condition that remains incurable but is treatable. Drug monitoring programs may help reduce supply, but will not reduce demand for these drugs. Nor will much be gained by urine testing pregnant women who are reluctant to disclose their drug use, because they fear — with cause — prosecution and/or loss of child custody. Indeed, it might make them more likely to avoid prenatal care or opt for abortion.The most promising approach is to ensure prompt treatment availability for all who might benefit. For pregnant women in particular, the leading federal authority on drugs advises opiate-dependent women: “Methadone maintenance treatment can save your baby’s life.”Robert G.
